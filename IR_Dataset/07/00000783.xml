'''Alexander III of Macedon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Αλέξανδρος Γʹ ὁ Μακεδών}}; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as '''Alexander the Great''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Μέγας|[[Alexander|Aléxandros]] ho Mégas}}), was a king (''[[basileus]]'') of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]{{Cref2|a}} and a member of the [[Argead dynasty]]. He was born in [[Pella]] in 356 BC and succeeded his father [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented [[military campaign]] through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] of the ancient world, stretching from [[Greece]] to northwestern [[Historical India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Jonathan M.; Blair, Sheila S.

''Central Asia in World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), 25;&quot;[...] his campaigns in Central Asia brought Khwarazm, Sogdia and Bactria under Graeco-Macedonian rule. As elsewhere, Alexander founded or renamed a number of cities, such as Alexandria Eschate (&quot;Outernmost Alexandria&quot;, near modern Khojent in Tajikistan).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | place = UK | title = Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alexander_the_great.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Commanders who never lost a battle|undefeated in battle]] and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.{{Sfn |Yenne|2010 | page = 159}}

During his youth, Alexander was tutored by [[Aristotle]] until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336&amp;nbsp;BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the [[League of Corinth|generalship of Greece]] and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Heckel|editor1-first=Waldemar|editor2-last=Tritle|editor2-first=Lawrence A.|title=Alexander the Great: A New History|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3082-0|page=99|chapter=The Corinthian League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burger|first1=Michael|title=The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-432-3|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 334 BC, he invaded the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (Persian Empire) and began a [[Wars of Alexander the Great|series of campaigns]] that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of [[Anatolia]], Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. He subsequently overthrew Persian King [[Darius III]] and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.{{Cref2|b}} At that point, his empire stretched from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Beas River]].

Alexander endeavoured to reach the &quot;ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea&quot; and [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|invaded India]] in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the [[Pauravas]] at the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in [[Babylon]] in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following [[Death of Alexander the Great|his death]], a [[Wars of the Diadochi|series of civil wars]] tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.

Alexander's legacy includes the [[cultural diffusion]] and [[syncretism]] which his conquests engendered, such as [[Greco-Buddhism]]. He founded some [[Alexandria (disambiguation)#Founded or renamed by Alexander the Great|twenty cities that bore his name]]&lt;!-- This links to a disambiguation page on purpose. --&gt;, most notably [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization]], aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek speakers in central]] and [[Pontic Greeks|far eastern Anatolia]] until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of [[Achilles]], and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He was undefeated in battle and became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves. [[Military academy|Military academies]] throughout the world still teach his tactics.{{Sfn |Yenne|2010|page=viii}}{{cref2|c}} He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/30/whos-most-significant-historical-figure|title = Guardian on Time Magazine's 100 personalities of all time|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 30 January 2014|last1 = Skiena|first1 = Steven|last2 = Ward|first2 = Charles B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was born in [[Pella]], the capital of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Green|first=Peter|title=Alexander of Macedon, 356–323 B.C.: a historical biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6Wl4AKGQkIC&amp;pg=PA559 |page=xxxiii|year=1970|series=Hellenistic culture and society|edition=illustrated, revised reprint|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07165-0|quote=356 – Alexander born in Pella.

Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}} According to the ancient Greek biographer [[Plutarch]], on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread &quot;far and wide&quot; before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] engraved with a lion's image.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA2&quot; /&gt; Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was [[Zeus]]. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA2&quot; /&gt;

On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a [[siege]] on the city of [[Potidea]] on the peninsula of [[Chalcidice]]. That same day, Philip received news that his general [[Parmenion]] had defeated the combined [[Illyria]]n and [[Paeonian]] armies and that his horses had won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. It was also said that on this day, the [[Temple of Artemis]] in [[Ephesus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], burnt down. This led [[Hegesias of Magnesia]] to say that it had burnt down because [[Artemis]] was away, attending the birth of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=28}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}}

In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, [[Lanike]], sister of Alexander's future general [[Cleitus the Black]]. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict [[Leonidas of Epirus|Leonidas]], a relative of his mother, and by [[Lysimachus of Acarnania]].{{sfn|Renault|2001|pp=33–34}} Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the [[lyre]], ride, fight, and hunt.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}}

[[File:Θεσσαλονίκη 2014 (The Statue of Alexander the Great) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Alexander the Great in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]]]]
When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from [[Thessaly]] brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen [[Attic talent|talents]]. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}} Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: &quot;My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you&quot;, and bought the horse for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA6&quot; /&gt; Alexander named it [[Bucephalas]], meaning &quot;ox-head&quot;. Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as [[India]]. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Durant|1966|p=538}}, {{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=64}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a [[tutor]], and considered such academics as [[Isocrates]] and [[Speusippus]], the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose [[Aristotle]] and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]] as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of [[Stageira]], which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|pp=65–66}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=44}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Hephaistion]], and [[Cassander]]. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of [[Homer]], and in particular the ''[[Iliad]]''; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|pp=65–66}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=45–47}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed [[Artaxerxes III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Timothy |last2=Brice |first2=Lee L. |title=Brill's Companion to Insurgency and Terrorism in the Ancient Mediterranean |date=2015 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-28473-9 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=248DCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EDC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Elizabeth Donnelly |title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia |date=2000 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-3212-9 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbI2hZBy_EkC&amp;pg=PA101 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Artabazos II]] and his daughter [[Barsine]], future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as [[Amminapes]], future [[satrap]] of Alexander, or a Persian nobleman named [[Sisines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cawthorne |first1=Nigel |title=Alexander the Great |date=2004 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=978-1-904341-56-7 |pages=42–43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxyz0v9T74sC&amp;pg=PA42 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Janett |title=Greek Perspectives on the Achaemenid Empire: Persia Through the Looking Glass |date=2016 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-4724-8 |pages=271–72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49JVDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Briant |first1=Pierre |title=Alexander the Great and His Empire: A Short Introduction |date=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15445-9 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW6kmL30RUC&amp;pg=PA114 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EJ&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Erik |title=Barbarians in the Greek and Roman World |date=2018 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=978-1-62466-714-5 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCRtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;/&gt;

At age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against [[Byzantium|Byzantion]], leaving Alexander in charge as [[regent]] and [[heir apparent]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}} During Philip's absence, the [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Maedi]] revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named [[Alexandropolis Maedica|Alexandropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=68}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=47}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern [[Thrace]]. Campaigning against the Greek city of [[Perinthus]], Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of [[Amphissa (city)|Amphissa]] began to work lands that were sacred to [[Apollo]] near [[Delphi]], a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.{{sfn|Renault|2001|pp=47–49}}

Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through [[Thermopylae]], taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of [[Elatea]], only a few days' march from both [[Athens]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. The Athenians, led by [[Demosthenes]], voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=50–51}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|pp=44–45}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the [[Amphictyonic League]]), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=51}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=47}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander1256.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Alexander in [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]]]
As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near [[Chaeronea]], [[Boeotia]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chaeronea (338&amp;nbsp;BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian [[hoplites]] to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiodXVI&quot; /&gt;

After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached [[Sparta]], they were refused, but did not resort to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305205126/http://www.sikyon.com/Sparta/history_eg.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=5 March 2001 |title=History of Ancient Sparta |work=Sikyon |accessdate=14 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], Philip established a &quot;Hellenic Alliance&quot; (modelled on the old [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#Hellenic alliance|anti-Persian alliance]] of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named ''[[Hegemon]]'' (often translated as &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;) of this league (known by modern scholars as the [[League of Corinth]]), and announced his plans to attack the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].{{sfn|Renault|2001|p=54}}{{Sfn |McCarty|2004|p= 26}}

===Exile and return===
When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra Eurydice]] in 338 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Peter|date=1991|title=Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age (Hellenistic Culture and Society) |location=Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=1|pages=|doi=10.1086/ahr/96.5.1515|issn=1937-5239}}&lt;/ref&gt; the niece of his general [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=179}} The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian.{{sfn|McCarty|2004|p=27}} During the [[Banquet|wedding banquet]], a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=179}}

{{Quote|At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, &quot;You villain,&quot; said he, &quot;what, am I then a bastard?&quot; Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor. At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: &quot;See there,&quot; said he, &quot;the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another.&quot;|Plutarch, describing the feud at Philip's wedding.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA9&quot; /&gt;}}

In 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King [[Alexander I of Epirus]] in [[Dodona]], capital of the [[Molossians]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}} He continued to Illyria,{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}} where he sought refuge with one or more Illyrian kings, perhaps with [[Glaucias of Taulantii|Glaukias]], and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Macedonia: Volume III: 336–167 B.C. By N. G. L. Hammond, F. W. Walbank&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}} Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, [[Demaratus (hetairos)|Demaratus]], who mediated between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=75}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, the Persian [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Caria]], [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]], offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, [[Philip Arrhidaeus]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}} Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}} Alexander reacted by sending an actor, [[Thessalus (actor)|Thessalus]] of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}} Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, [[Harpalus]], [[Nearchus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Erigyius]], and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=27}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=59}}, {{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 336&amp;nbsp;BC, while at [[Vergina|Aegae]] attending the wedding of his daughter [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]] to Olympias's brother, [[Alexander I of Epirus]], Philip was assassinated by the captain of his [[Somatophylax|bodyguards]], [[Pausanias of Orestis|Pausanias]].{{Cref2|e}} As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, [[Perdiccas]] and [[Leonnatus]]. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and [[Ancient Macedonian military|army]] at the age of 20.{{sfn|McCarty|2004|pp=30–31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 1980 72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation of power===
Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], executed.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=190}} He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of [[Lyncestis]] killed, but spared a third, [[Alexander Lyncestes]]. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus,{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=190}} who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2007 5–6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2007 5–6&quot; /&gt; Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.{{sfn|McCarty|2004|pp=30–31}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 1980 72&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between [[Mount Olympus]] and [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Mount Ossa]], and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=31}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=72}}, {{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=104}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to [[Corinth]]. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous [[Diogenes and Alexander|encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic]] occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight.{{sfn|Stoneman|2004|p=21}} This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said &quot;But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes.&quot;{{sfn|Dillon|2004|pp=187–88}} At Corinth, Alexander took the title of ''Hegemon'' (&quot;leader&quot;) and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=72}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balkan campaign===
{{Main|Alexander's Balkan campaign}}
[[File:The Macedonian phalanx counter-attacks during the battle of the carts.jpg|thumb|The Macedonian phalanx at the &quot;Battle of the Carts&quot; against the Thracians in 335 BC.]]
Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335&amp;nbsp;BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from [[Amphipolis]], he travelled east into the country of the &quot;Independent Thracians&quot;; and at [[Haemus Mons|Mount Haemus]], the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;I, 1&quot; /&gt; The Macedonians marched into the country of the [[Triballi]], and defeated their army near the Lyginus river&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[List of tributaries of the Danube|tributary of the Danube]]). Alexander then marched for three days to the [[Danube]], encountering the [[Getae]] tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry [[skirmish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 3–4}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News then reached Alexander that [[Cleitus (Dardania)|Cleitus]], King of Illyria, and [[King Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii]] were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 5–6}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=192}} While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=192}} Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving [[Antipater]] as regent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 336 BC [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] had already sent [[Parmenion]], with [[Amyntas (son of Andromenes)|Amyntas]], Andromenes and [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], and an army of 10,000 men into [[Anatolia]] to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;PB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Briant |first1=Pierre |title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire |date=2002 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=978-1-57506-120-7 |page=817 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&amp;pg=PA817 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heckel |first1=Waldemar |title=Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great: Prosopography of Alexander's Empire |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-5469-7 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NR4Wn9VU8vkC&amp;pg=PT205 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip's death and were subsequently defeated near [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]] by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary [[Memnon of Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;/&gt;

Taking over the invasion project of Philip II, Alexander's army crossed the [[Hellespont]] in 334&amp;nbsp;BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000,{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=192}} drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from [[Thrace]], [[Paionia]], and [[Illyria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cref2|f}} He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=192}}

After an initial victory against Persian forces at the [[Battle of the Granicus]], Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of [[Sardis]]; he then proceeded along the [[Ionia]]n coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at [[Halicarnassus]], in [[Caria]], Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale [[siege]], eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain [[Memnon of Rhodes]] and the Persian [[satrap]] of Caria, [[Orontobates]], to withdraw by sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who adopted Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrian 1976 loc=I, 23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous [[Lycia]] and the [[Pamphylia]]n plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At [[Termessos]], Alexander humbled but did not storm the [[Pisidia]]n city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ancient Phrygian capital of [[Gordium]], Alexander &quot;undid&quot; the hitherto unsolvable [[Gordian Knot]], a feat said to await the future &quot;king of [[Asia Minor|Asia]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Levant and Syria===
{{Further|Battle of Issus|Siege of Tyre (332 BC)}}

In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother [[Sisygambis]], and a fabulous treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered a [[peace treaty]] that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 [[Attic talent|talents]] for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46976/46976-h/46976-h.htm The Anabasis of Alexander/Book II/Chapter XIV/Darius's Letter, and Alexander's Reply – Arrian]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alexander proceeded to take possession of [[Ancient Syria|Syria]], and most of the coast of the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrian 1976 loc=I, 23&quot; /&gt; In the following year, 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he was forced to attack [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], which he captured after a long and difficult [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=II, 16–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gunther|2007|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabin|van Wees|Whitby|2007|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to [[Egypt]] quickly capitulated. However, Alexander met with resistance at [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When &quot;his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the 
attempt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=II, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=II, 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332&amp;nbsp;BC, where he was regarded as a liberator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ring|Salkin|Berney|Schellinger|1994|pp=49, 320}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was pronounced son of the deity [[Amun]] at the [[Oracle]] of [[Siwa Oasis]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert.{{sfn|Bosworth|1988|pp=71–74}} Henceforth, Alexander often referred to [[Zeus-Ammon]] as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with the [[Horns of Ammon]] as a symbol of his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dahmen|2007|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Egypt, he founded [[Alexandria|Alexandria-by-Egypt]], which would become the prosperous capital of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=III, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyria and Babylonia===
{{Further|Battle of Gaugamela}}
Leaving Egypt in 331&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander marched eastward into [[Mesopotamia]] (now northern [[Iraq]]) and again defeated Darius, at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=III 7–15}}; also in a [http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t40.html contemporary Babylonian account of the battle of Gaugamela]&lt;/ref&gt; Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as [[Erbil|Arbela]]. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two. Darius fled over the mountains to [[Ecbatana]] (modern [[Hamadan]]), while Alexander captured [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIII16&quot; /&gt;

===Persia===
{{Further|Battle of the Persian Gate}}
[[File:2persian gate wall.JPG|thumb|Site of the [[Persian Gate]]; the road was built in the 1990s.]]

From Babylon, Alexander went to [[Susa]], one of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] capitals, and captured its treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIII16&quot; /&gt; He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of [[Persepolis]] via the Persian [[Royal Road]]. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the [[Persian Gates]] (in the modern [[Zagros Mountains]]) which had been blocked by a Persian army under [[Ariobarzanes (satrap of Persis)|Ariobarzanes]] and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=III, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foreman|2004|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=121}} During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of [[Xerxes I]] and spread to the rest of the city.

Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc= III, 19–20}} The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by [[Bessus]], his [[Bactria]]n satrap and kinsman.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976| loc= III, 21}} As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against Alexander.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc=III, 21, 25}} Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral.{{Sfn | Arrian| 1976 | loc = III, 22}} He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.{{sfn|Gergel|2004|p=81}} The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander10.html|title=The end of Persia|publisher = Livius |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan, and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (&quot;The Furthest&quot;) in modern [[Tajikistan]]. The campaign took Alexander through [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] (West Afghanistan), [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]] (South and Central Afghanistan), [[Bactria]] (North and Central Afghanistan), and [[Scythia]].{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc=III, 23–25, 27–30; IV, 1–7}}

In 329 BC, [[Spitamenes]], who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc= III, 30}} However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the [[Battle of Jaxartes]] and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc = IV, 5–6, 16–17}}

===Problems and plots===
 [[File:The killing of Cleitus by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899) reduced.jpg|thumb|''The Killing of [[Cleitus the Black|Cleitus]]'', by [[André Castaigne]] (1898–1899)]]

During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII11&quot; /&gt; The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of [[deities]] and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=111}}

A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, [[Philotas]], was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus [[Parmenion]], who had been charged with guarding the treasury at [[Ecbatana]], was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Cleitus the Black]], during a violent drunken altercation at [[Maracanda]] (modern day [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]]), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.{{sfn|Gergel|2004|p=99}}

Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal [[page (servant)|pages]]. His official historian, [[Callisthenes]] of [[Olynthus]], was implicated in the plot, and in the ''[[Anabasis of Alexander]]'', [[Arrian]] states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the [[rack (torture)|rack]] as punishment, and likely died soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026460752/cu31924026460752_djvu.txt The Anabasis of Arrian]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heckel|Tritle|2009|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macedon in Alexander's absence===
When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general [[Antipater]], an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's &quot;Old Guard&quot;, in charge of Macedon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt; Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt; The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king [[Agis III]] in 331&amp;nbsp;BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the [[battle of Megalopolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt; Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171–168 BC).{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}}

==Indus campaign==
{{Main|Indian campaign of Alexander the Great}}

===Forays into the Indus region===
 [[File:The phalanx attacking the centre in the battle of the Hydaspes by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|''The [[Phalanx]] Attacking the Centre in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]'' by André Castaigne (1898–1899).]]
[[File:AlexanderConquestsInIndia.jpg|thumb|Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent.]]

After the death of [[Spitamenes]] and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in [[Old Iranian]]) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He invited the [[tribal chief|chieftains]] of the former satrapy of [[Gandhara]] (a region presently straddling eastern [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]]), to come to him and submit to his authority. [[Omphis]] (Indian name [[Ambhi]]), the ruler of [[Taxila]], whose kingdom extended from the [[Indus]] to the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes (Jhelum)]], complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the [[Aspasioi]] and [[Assakenoi]] sections of the [[Kambojas]] (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=118–21}} [[Ambhi]] hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of &quot;Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold&quot;. Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at [[Hund, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Hund]],&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox 1973&lt;/ref&gt; supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

On the subsequent advance of the [[Macedon]]ian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the [[battle of the Hydaspes River]]. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]], son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC.

In the winter of 327/326&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Narain|1965|pp=155–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought against him from the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and [[Aornos]].{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=118–21}}

The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], &quot;Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCrindle |first=J. W. |chapter=Curtius |title=History of Punjab |volume=I |year=1997 |publisher=[[Punjabi University]] |location=Patiala |editor1-first=Fauja |editor1-last=Singh |editor2-first=L. M. |editor2-last=Joshi |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of [[Aornos]]. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=118–21}}

After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against [[Porus|King Porus]], who ruled a region lying between the [[Hydaspes]] and the Acesines ([[Chenab]]), in what is now the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] in 326&amp;nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=124–25}} Alexander was impressed by Porus' bravery, and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not previously own, towards the south-east, up to the Hyphasis ([[Beas]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;p. xl, Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Warfare, J, Woronoff &amp; I. Spence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Arrian Anabasis of Alexander, V.29.2&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=126–27}} Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes]] river, naming one [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]], in honour of his horse, who died around this time.{{sfn|Gergel|2004|p=120}} The other was [[Nicaea (Punjab)|Nicaea]] (Victory), thought to be located at the site of modern-day [[Mong, Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2003|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus the Elder]] in the [[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]] writes that in the army of Porus there was an elephant who fought brave against Alexander's army and Alexander dedicated it to the [[Helios]] (Sun) and named it Ajax, because he thought that a so great animal deserved a great name. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek: &quot;Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to the Helios&quot; (ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ Ο ΔΙΟΣ ΤΟΝ ΑΙΑΝΤΑ ΤΩΙ ΗΛΙΩΙ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0638.tlg001.perseus-grc1:2.12 Philostratus the Elder, Life of Apollonius of Tyana, § 2.12]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt of the army===
[[File:Asia 323bc.jpg|thumb|Asia in 323&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Nanda Empire]] and the [[Gangaridai]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]], in relation to Alexander's Empire and neighbours.]]

East of Porus' kingdom, near the [[Ganges River]], was the [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda Empire]] of [[Magadha]], and further east, the [[Gangaridai|Gangaridai Empire]] of [[Bengal]] region of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the [[Beas River|Hyphasis River (Beas)]], refusing to march farther east.{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=34}} This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=129–30}}

{{quote|As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand [[war elephant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA62&quot; /&gt;}}

Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]] pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, &quot;longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland&quot;. Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the [[Indus River|Indus]]. Along the way his army conquered the [[Malhi]] (in modern-day [[Multan]]) and other Indian tribes and Alexander sustained an injury during the siege.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=137–38}}

Alexander sent much of his army to [[Kerman province|Carmania]] (modern southern [[Iran]]) with general [[Craterus]], and commissioned a fleet to explore the [[Persian Gulf]] shore under his admiral [[Nearchus]], while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the [[Gedrosia|Gedrosian Desert]] and [[Makran]].{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|p=141}} Alexander reached Susa in 324&amp;nbsp;BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years in Persia==
[[File:Alexander and Hephaestion.jpg|thumb|Alexander, left, and [[Hephaestion]], right]]
Discovering that many of his [[satrap]]s and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to [[Susa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AVI27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII4&quot; /&gt; As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of [[Opis]].

After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 194&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander [[Susa weddings|held a mass marriage]] of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII4&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the [[tomb of Cyrus the Great]] in [[Pasargadae]] had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVI29&quot; /&gt; Alexander admired [[Cyrus the Great]], from an early age reading Xenophon's ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulrich&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the Great|author=Ulrich Wilcken|publisher=W.W.

==Death and succession==
{{Main|Death of Alexander the Great}}
[[File:Babylonian astronomical diary recording the death of Alexander the Great (British Museum).jpg|thumb|A [[Babylonian astronomical diary]] (c.&amp;nbsp;323–322&amp;nbsp;BC) recording the death of Alexander ([[British Museum]], London)]]
On either 10 or 11 June 323&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander died in the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], in [[Babylon]], at age 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;Depuydt&quot; /&gt; There are two different versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. [[Plutarch]]'s account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral [[Nearchus]], and spent the night and next day drinking with [[Medius of Larissa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P75&quot; /&gt; He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.{{Sfn |Wood|2001|pp= 2267–70}} In the second account, [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of [[Heracles]], followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII117&quot; /&gt; [[Arrian]] also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;P75&quot; /&gt;

Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination,{{sfn|Green|2007|pp= 1–2}} foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication,&lt;ref name=&quot;PA77&quot; /&gt; while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII117&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII27&quot; /&gt; The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating [[Antipater]], recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence,{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=23–24}} and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII118&quot; /&gt; Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII118&quot; /&gt; There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII27&quot; /&gt;

The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available.{{Sfn |Lane Fox|2006|loc= chapter 32}} However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (''[[Veratrum album]]''), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 October 2003 |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/2003/10/16/alexander/ |title=NZ scientist's detective work may reveal how Alexander died |accessdate=15 January 2014 |location=Dunedin |work=The Royal Society of New Zealand |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116141707/http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/2003/10/16/alexander/ |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Cawthorne|2004|p= 138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bursztajn | first = Harold J | title = Dead Men Talking | journal = Harvard Medical Alumni Bulletin | year = 2005 | issue = Spring | url= http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artDeadMenTalking.php | accessdate =16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 manuscript in the journal [[Clinical Toxicology]], Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with ''Veratrum album'', and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the ''[[Alexander Romance]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;schep&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Wheatley P |title=Was the death of Alexander the Great due to poisoning?

A 1998 article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by [[bowel perforation]] and ascending [[paralysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMD&quot; /&gt; Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) [[spondylitis]] or [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ashrafian&quot; /&gt; Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including [[acute pancreatitis]] and [[West Nile virus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Sbarounis| first = CN | title=Did Alexander the Great die of acute pancreatitis? |journal= J Clin Gastroenterol |volume= 24 | pages = 294–96 |year=2007 |doi=10.1097/00004836-199706000-00031 |pmid=9252868 |issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds.

===After death===
{{see also|Tomb of Alexander the Great}}
Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid [[sarcophagus]] that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket.&lt;ref name=&quot;sarco1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/personal/ron/CVNC/byline/bugs_96mar.html |date=Mar 1996 | title = Bayfront Byline Bug Walk |publisher = UCSD | accessdate= 25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest &quot;would be happy and unvanquishable forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aelian&quot; /&gt; Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a [[royal prerogative]].{{Sfn |Green|2007|p= 32}}

While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis.&lt;ref name=&quot;sarco1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aelian&quot; /&gt; His successor, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least [[late Antiquity]]. [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage.&lt;ref name=&quot;sarco2&quot; /&gt; The recent discovery of an [[Kasta Tomb|enormous tomb]] in northern Greece, at [[Amphipolis]], dating from the time of Alexander the Great&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29239529|title=Greeks captivated by Alexander-era tomb at Amphipolis|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 September 2014|last1=Christides|first1=Giorgos}}&lt;/ref&gt; has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege.

[[File:Alexander Sarcophagus Battle of Issus.jpg|thumb|Detail of Alexander on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]]]]
[[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus]] all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. [[Caligula]] was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD&amp;nbsp;200, Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, [[Caracalla]], a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.&lt;ref name=&quot;sarco2&quot; /&gt;

The so-called &quot;[[Alexander Sarcophagus]]&quot;, discovered near [[Sidon]] and now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]], is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of [[Abdalonymus]] (died 311&amp;nbsp;BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the [[battle of Issus]] in 331.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Studniczka|1894|pp=226ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bieber|first= M |title=The Portraits of Alexander |journal=Greece &amp; Rome |series=Second Series|year=1965 |pages=183–88|volume = 12 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1017/s0017383500015345}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

===Division of the empire===

Also shown are the [[Roman Republic]] (light blue), the [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian Republic]] (purple), and the [[Epirus (ancient state)|Kingdom of Epirus]] (red).]]

Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt; Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=24–26}} According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was &quot;tôi kratistôi&quot;—&quot;to the strongest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII117&quot; /&gt; Another theory is that his successors willfully or erroneously misheard &quot;tôi Kraterôi&quot;—&quot;to Craterus&quot;, the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Shipley&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greek World After Alexander 323–30 BC|author= Graham Shipley| page= 40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAoiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 |isbn= 978-1-134-06531-8|date= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] to [[Perdiccas]], a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII117&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=24–26}}

Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, [[Craterus]], Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]], rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=26–29}}

Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the [[Partition of Babylon]] became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321&amp;nbsp;BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40&amp;nbsp;years of war between &quot;The Successors&quot; (''Diadochi'') ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocs: [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] Egypt, [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] Mesopotamia and Central Asia, [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid]] Anatolia, and [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid]] Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=29–34}}

===Will===
[[File:Agathokles commemorative coin for Alexander the Great.jpg|thumb|Commemorative coin by [[Agathocles of Bactria]] (190–180 BC) for Alexander the Great]]
[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVIII4&quot; /&gt; Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVIII4&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's [[Will and testament|will]] to his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt;

Alexander's will called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:
* Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip, &quot;to match the greatest of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt;
* Erection of great temples in [[Delos]], [[Delphi]], [[Dodona]], [[Dium]], [[Amphipolis]], and a monumental temple to [[Athena]] at [[Troy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot; /&gt;

===Generalship===
[[File:Battle granicus.gif|thumb|The [[Battle of the Granicus]], 334 BC]]
[[File:Battle issus decisive.gif|thumb|The [[Battle of Issus]], 333 BC]]

Alexander earned the epithet &quot;the Great&quot; due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=192}} This was due to use of terrain, [[phalanx]] and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 193&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=193}}, {{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Macedonian phalanx]], armed with the [[sarissa]], a spear {{convert |6|m|ft}} long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Persian forces.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=110}} Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse&lt;!--disparate?--&gt; army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle,{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=121}} in the manner of a Macedonian king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 193&quot;/&gt;

In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces,{{citation needed|reason=Plutarch and Polybios, citing earlier writers, give the strength as ranging from 30k foot and 4k horse to 43k foot and 5,500 horse|date=March 2014}} perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about {{convert|3|km|2|abbr=on}}. By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persians' [[scimitars]] and [[javelins]]. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}}

At Issus in 333&amp;nbsp;BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}} Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=193}} At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}}

When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]], Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=193}} In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Roisman 2010 194&quot; /&gt;

===Physical appearance===
Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] ({{circa| 45|120&amp;nbsp;AD}}) describes Alexander's appearance as:

{{quote|The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. Moreover, that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with it, this we have read in the ''Memoirs of Aristoxenus''.{{Sfn |Plutarch|1919|loc = [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0243:chapter=4&amp;highlight=lysippus IV, 1]}}}}

Greek historian [[Arrian]] (Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon' {{circa| 86|160&amp;nbsp;AD}}) described Alexander as:

{{quote | [T]he strong, handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://free-history-dictionary-books-hotels-health-maps.mithec.com/eng/alexander_the_great.html | work = Mithec | title = Alexander the Great}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpatc.org.bd/elibrary/files/1271169473ALEXANDERTHEGREAT.pdf |title=Alexander the Great |first=John J |last=Popovic |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730185533/http://www.bpatc.org.bd/elibrary/files/1271169473ALEXANDERTHEGREAT.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The semi-legendary ''[[Alexander romance|Alexander Romance]]'' also suggests that Alexander exhibited [[heterochromia iridum]]: that one eye was dark and the other light.{{Sfn |Grafton|2010|p= 27}}

British historian [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] provided a description of Alexander's appearance, based on his review of statues and some ancient documents:

{{quote | Physically, Alexander was not prepossessing. Even by Macedonian standards he was very short, though stocky and tough. His beard was scanty, and he stood out against his hirsute Macedonian barons by going clean-shaven. His neck was in some way twisted, so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle. His eyes (one blue, one brown) revealed a dewy, feminine quality. He had a [[high complexion]] and a harsh voice.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp= 15–16}} }}

Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by [[Lysippos]] that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Images of Authority II: The Greek Example | year= 2005 | publisher = SUNY Oneonta | url = http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth200/politics/images_authority_2_greek.html | accessdate = 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysippos had often used the [[contrapposto]] sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as [[Apoxyomenos]], [[Hermes]] and [[Eros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grout | first = James | title = Lysippus: Apoxyomenos | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Romana | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/museums/apoxyomenos.html | accessdate = 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.{{Sfn |Bosworth|1988|pp = 19–20}}

Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=15–16}} Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him,{{sfn|Green|2007|p=4}} and Plutarch tells how his ambition &quot;kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA4&quot; /&gt; However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=190}} Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=15–16}} While Alexander worried that his father would leave him &quot;no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;PA5&quot; /&gt; he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=15–16}}

According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII29&quot; /&gt; which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=15–16}} Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA7&quot; /&gt; He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA8&quot; /&gt; This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=15–16}} His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII29&quot; /&gt; He had great self-restraint in &quot;pleasures of the body&quot;, in contrast with his lack of [[self-control]] with alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Arrian|1976|loc=VII, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PA8&quot; /&gt; However, he had little interest in sports or the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic games]] (unlike his father), seeking only the [[Homeric]] ideals of honour (''timê'') and glory (''kudos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=190}}, {{harvnb|Green|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had great [[charisma]] and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=24–26}}&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII29&quot; /&gt; His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=24–26}}

During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of [[megalomania]] and [[paranoia]].{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=23–24}} His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=20–21}} His [[delusions of grandeur]] are readily visible in his [[#Will|will]] and in his desire to conquer the world,{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=23–24}} in as much as he is by various sources described as having ''boundless ambition'',&lt;ref&gt;M Wood (edited by T Gergel) – [https://books.google.com/books?id=5kxoAAAAMAAJ Alexander: Selected Texts from Arrian, Curtius and Plutarch] Penguin, 2004 {{ISBN|0-14-101312-5}} [Retrieved 8 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUqQbemlo80C&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7 |title=Medieval French Alexander, the |isbn=9780791488324 |last1=Maddox |first1=Donald |last2=Sturm-Maddox |first2=Sara |date=February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.&lt;ref&gt;G Highet&lt;!-- taught classics at Oxford University until 1938; in 1950 he was appointed Anthon Professor of the Latin Language and Literature at Columbia University --&gt; – [https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbBTeM9M2oC&amp;pg=PA68 The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature], Oxford University Press, 31 December 1949 p. 68 [Retrieved 2015-04-08] (ed. c.f. – [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clich%C3%A9 Merriam-webster.com])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epithet – epithet] [Retrieved 8 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times.{{sfn  |Ogden |2009 |p=204}} The Roman era writer [[Athenaeus]] says, based on the scholar [[Dicaearchus]], who was Alexander's contemporary, that the king &quot;was quite excessively keen on boys&quot;, and that Alexander sexually embraced his eunuch Bagoas in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents|editor=Thomas K. Hubbard|year=2003|isbn=978-0520234307|publisher=University of California Press|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode is also told by Plutarch, probably based on the same source. None of Alexander's contemporaries, however, are known to have explicitly described Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion as sexual, though the pair was often compared to [[Achilles and Patroclus]], whom classical Greek culture painted as a couple. Aelian writes of Alexander's visit to [[Troy]] where &quot;Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion that of [[Patroclus]], the latter hinting that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AelXII7&quot; /&gt; Some modern historians (e.g., [[Robin Lane Fox]]) believe not only that Alexander's youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual, but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood, which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities, such as Athens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilyn Skinner|title=Sexuality in Greek and Roman Culture (Ancient Cultures), 2nd edition|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4443-4986-3|page=190|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Sacks |1995 |p=16}} though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia (or at least the Macedonian court) may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hubbard|editor-first=Thomas|title=A Companion to Greek and Roman Sexualities|date=2014|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-4051-9572-0|page=143|chapter=Chapter 8: Peer Homosexuality|author=Thomas Hubbard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.{{sfn |Green |2007 |pp=15–16}} However, Ogden calculates that Alexander, who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years, had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age.{{sfn |Ogden |2009 |p=208 |ps=...&amp;nbsp;three attested pregnancies in eight years produces an attested impregnation rate of one every 2.7&amp;nbsp;years, which is actually superior to that of his father.}} Two of these pregnancies — Stateira's and Barsine's — are of dubious legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Nature of Alexander]]|author=[[Mary Renault]]|quote=No record at all exists of such a woman [ie, Barsine] accompanying his march; nor of any claim by her, or her powerful kin, that she had borne him offspring. Yet twelve years after his death a boy was produced, seventeen years old, born therefore five years after Damascus, her alleged son &quot;brought up in Pergamon&quot;; a claimant and shortlived pawn in the succession wars, chosen probably for a physical resemblance to Alexander. That he actually did marry another Barsine must have helped both to launch and preserve the story; but no source reports any notice whatever taken by him of a child who, Roxane's being posthumous, would have been during his lifetime his only son, by a near-royal mother. In a man who named cities after his horse and dog, this strains credulity.|page=110|year=1979|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=978-0394738253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly,&lt;ref name=&quot;DSXVII77&quot; /&gt; showing great self-control in &quot;pleasures of the body&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVII28&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.{{Sfn | Plutarch| 1936 |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Fortuna_Alexandri*/2.html |author=Plutarch |title=Moralia |id=I, 11 |publisher=University of Chicago}} Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including [[Ada of Caria]], who adopted him, and even Darius' mother [[Sisygambis]], who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=15–16}}

Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}} Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}}

Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some {{convert|5200000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;uconn&quot;&gt;Peter Turchin, Thomas D. Hall and Jonathan M.

The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=24–26}} However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history, the [[Maurya Empire]]. Taking advantage of this power vacuum, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (referred to in Greek sources as &quot;Sandrokottos&quot;), of relatively humble origin, took control of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and with that power base proceeded to conquer the [[Nanda Empire]].{{sfn|Keay|2001|pp=82–85}}

There the townspeople were laying out their new city and building a temple to its patron goddess. Alexander offered funds to complete the temple, and the inscription on this wall block, cut into a block of marble, records his gift. The inscription was found in the 19th century by the architect-archaeologist Richard Pullan leading an expedition on behalf of the Society of Dilettanti.

''Hellenization'' was coined by the German historian [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=xii–xix}} That this export took place is undoubted, and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]]{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=56–59}} and [[Seleucia]] (south of modern [[Baghdad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waterman |first1=Leroy |last2=McDowell |first2=Robert H. |last3=Hopkins |first3=Clark |title=Seleucia on the Tigris, Iraq |publisher=The Kelsey Online |year=1998 |url=http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html |work=umich.edu |accessdate=16 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527081841/http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html |archivedate=27 May 2012 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=21, 56–59}}

The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially [[Athenian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|pp=56–59}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely [[Attic Greek|Attic]]-based &quot;[[koine]]&quot;, or &quot;common&quot; Greek dialect.{{sfn|Harrison|1971|p=51}} Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the [[lingua franca]] of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of [[modern Greek]].{{sfn|Harrison|1971|p=51}} Furthermore, [[Urban planning|town planning]], education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=56–59}} Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynes|2007|p=170}}, {{harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hellenization in Central Asia and India ====
{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek art|Greco-Buddhism}}
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], in [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist style]], 1st to 2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]], northern Pakistan. [[Tokyo National Museum]].]]
Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (250–125 BC) (in modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Tajikistan]]) and the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180 BC – 10 AD) in modern Afghanistan and India.{{sfn|Keay|2001|pp=101–09}} On the [[Silk Road]] trade routes, Hellenistic culture hybridized with Iranian and [[Buddhist]] cultures. The cosmopolitan art and mythology of [[Gandhara]] (a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus, Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan) of the ~3rd century BC to the ~5th century AD are most evident of the direct contact between Hellenistic civilization and South Asia, as are the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], which directly mention the Greeks within Ashoka's dominion as converting to Buddhism and the reception of Buddhist emissaries by Ashoka's contemporaries in the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan: Art of Gandhara|last=Proser|first=Adriana|publisher=Asia Society|year=2011|isbn=978-0-87848-112-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[syncretism]] known as [[Greco-Buddhism]] influenced the development of Buddhism{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and created a culture of [[Greco-Buddhist art]]. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to [[China]], [[Sri Lanka]] and Hellenistic Asia and Europe ([[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]).

Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of [[Apollo]] in the Greco-Buddhist style.{{sfn|Keay|2001|pp=101–09}} Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the [[ancient Greek religion]]: the concept of [[Boddhisatvas]] is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luniya|1978|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Mahayana]] [[Offering (Buddhism)|ceremonial practices]] (burning [[incense]], gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, [[Menander I]], probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]] as 'Milinda'.{{sfn|Keay|2001|pp=101–09}} The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pingree (1978), 533, 554f.&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pingree|1978|pp=533, 554ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the [[Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai Khanoum]] in modern-day [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pierre |last1=Cambon |first2=Jean-François |last2=Jarrige |year=2006 |language=French |title=Afghanistan, les trésors retrouvés: Collections du Musée national de Kaboul |trans-title=Afghanistan, the treasures found: collections of the Kabul national museum |publisher=Réunion des musées nationaux |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xJFtQgAACAAJ |ref=harv |page=269 |isbn=978-2-7118-5218-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Greek concept of a [[spherical earth]] surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pingree (1978), 533, 554f.&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayashi08Aryabhata&quot;&gt;Hayashi (2008), ''Aryabhata I''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yavanajataka]] (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and [[Paulisa Siddhanta]] texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.

Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]] was far-ranging. In the area of [[architecture]], a few examples of the [[Ionic order]] can be found as far as [[Pakistan]] with the [[Jandial|Jandial temple]] near [[Taxila]]. Several examples of [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as [[Patna]], especially with the [[Pataliputra capital]], dated to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=438 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7DX-CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA438 |title = A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture|isbn = 9781119019534|last1 = Brown|first1 = Rebecca M.|last2 = Hutton|first2 = Deborah S.|date = 22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corinthian order]] is also heavily represented in the [[Greco-Buddhist art|art of Gandhara]], especially through [[Indo-Corinthian capital]]s.

===Influence on Rome===
[[File:Roman - Medallion with Alexander the Great - Walters 591 - Obverse.jpg|thumb|This medallion was produced in [[Imperial Rome]], demonstrating the influence of Alexander's memory. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, p. 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] began his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. [[Pompey the Great]] adopted the epithet &quot;Magnus&quot; and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot; /&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] dedicated a [[Lysippus|Lysippean]] [[equestrian statue|equestrian]] [[bronze]] statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while [[Octavian]] visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a [[sphinx]] to Alexander's profile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot; /&gt; The emperor [[Trajan]] also admired Alexander, as did [[Nero]] and [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot; /&gt; The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of [[Macrinus]] briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewelry, or embroidered into their clothes.{{sfn|Holt|2003|p=3}}

[[File:Demetrius I of Bactria.jpg|thumb|The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] (reigned {{circa|200|180&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), wearing an elephant scalp, took over Alexander's legacy in the east by again invading [[India]], and establishing the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180&amp;nbsp;BC–10&amp;nbsp;AD).]]

On the other hand, some Roman writers, particularly Republican figures, used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how [[autocratic]] tendencies can be kept in check by [[Roman republic|republican]] values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, p. 115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as {{lang|la|amicita}} (friendship) and {{lang|la|clementia}} (clemency), but also {{lang|la|iracundia}} (anger) and {{lang|la|cupiditas gloriae}} (over-desire for glory).&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham2&quot; /&gt;

===Unsuccessful plan to cut a canal through the isthmus===
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] writes that Alexander wanted to dig the Mimas mountain (today at the [[Karaburun]] area), but he didn't succeed. He also mentions that this was the only unsuccessful project of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-grc1:2.1.5 Pausanias, Description of Greece, §2.1.5]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Pliny the Elder]] writes about this unsuccessful plan adding that the distance was {{convert|7+1/2|mi|km|order=flip|0}}, and the purpose was to cut a canal through the isthmus, so as to connect the Caystrian and Hermaean bays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.%20Nat.%205.31&amp;lang=original Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, 5.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=mimas-geo Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) William Smith, LLD, Ed.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legend===
{{Main|Alexander the Great in legend}}
Legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=187}} His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in [[Cilicia]] as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, [[Onesicritus]], invented a [[Courtship|tryst]] between Alexander and [[Thalestris]], queen of the mythical [[Amazons]]. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King [[Lysimachus]] reportedly quipped, &quot;I wonder where I was at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PA46&quot; /&gt;

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoneman|1996|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing many dubious stories,{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=187}} and was translated into numerous languages.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=117}}

===In ancient and modern culture===
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great in the Quran}}
[[File:Byzantine Greek Alexander Manuscript Cataphract (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Alexander the Great depicted in a 14th-century Byzantine manuscript]]

Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. The ''Alexander Romance'', in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=117}}

Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermor&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fermor|2006|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (&quot;O Megalexandros&quot;) is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the [[Karagiozis]] shadow play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermor&quot; /&gt; One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary [[mermaid]] who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain &quot;Is King Alexander alive?&quot; The correct answer is &quot;He is alive and well and rules the world!&quot; causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging [[Gorgon]] who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermor&quot; /&gt;

In pre-Islamic [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] ([[Zoroastrian]]) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet ''gujastak'', meaning &quot;accursed&quot;, and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|Tallis|Andre-Salvini|2005|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sunni Islamic Persia, under the influence of the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' (in {{lang-fa|اسکندرنامه}} ''[[Iskandarnamah]]''), a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=120}} [[Firdausi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;) includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian [[shah]]s, a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the [[Fountain of Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy, portraying him at a symposium with figures such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and Aristotle, in search of immortality.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=120}}

The figure of [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (literally &quot;the Two-Horned One&quot;) mentioned in the [[Quran]] is believed by scholars to be based on later legends of Alexander.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=120}} In this tradition, he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of [[Gog and Magog]].{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=122}} He then travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Immortality, eventually becoming a prophet.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=122}}

The [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the ''Alexander Romance'' portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to &quot;the one true God&quot;.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=120}} In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of [[Nectanebo II]], the last [[pharaoh]] before the Persian conquest.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=122}} His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, &quot;proving&quot; Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=120}}

According to [[Josephus]], Alexander was shown the [[Book of Daniel]] when he entered Jerusalem, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. This is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Jewish Antiquities]], XI, 337 [http://lexundria.com/j_aj/11.304-12.0/wst viii, 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], the name &quot;Sikandar&quot;, derived from the Persian name for Alexander, denotes a rising young talent, and the Delhi Sultanate ruler [[Alauddin Khalji|Aladdin Khajli]] stylized himself as &quot;Sikandar-i-Sani&quot; (the Second Alexander the Great).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Connerney|2009|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval India]], Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iranian-cultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander to the Indian subcontinent, resulting in the efflorescence of ''Sikandernameh'' ([[Alexander romance|Alexander Romances]]) written by Indo-Persian poets such as [[Amir Khusrow]] and the prominence of Alexander the Great as a popular subject in Mughal-era Persian miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donde|first=Dipanwita|date=2014|title=The Mughal Sikander: Influence of the Romance of Alexander on Mughal Manuscript Painting|url=https://www.academia.edu/6097802|journal=International Conference of Greek Studies: An Asian Perspective|volume=|pages=|via=Academia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noll|first1=Thomas|article=The Visual Image of Alexander the Great|title=Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages: Transcultural Perspectives|editor-last=Stock|editor-first=Markus|translator-last=Boettcher|translator-first=Susan|date=2016|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-4466-3|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nqMCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek Anthology]] there are poems referring to Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/534#9.699 GREEK ANTHOLOGY, BOOK 9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/748#122 GREEK ANTHOLOGY, BOOK 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish playwright [[Aubrey Thomas de Vere]] wrote ''[[Alexander the Great, a Dramatic Poem]]''.

In popular culture, the British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] included a song titled &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; on their 1986 album ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]''. Written by bass player [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], the song retells Alexander's life.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography of Alexander the Great}}
Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments, texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}} Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and [[Nearchus]]; [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these [[primary source|original sources]] have survived. The earliest of these is [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], whose work dated as late as the 4th century.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}} Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}}
