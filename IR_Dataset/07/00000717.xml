'''Alberta''' is a [[provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Canada]]. With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta&quot;/&gt; it is [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by population|Canada's fourth most populous province]] and the most populous of Canada's three [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]]. Its area is about {{convert|660,000|km2}}. Alberta and its neighbour [[Saskatchewan]] were [[districts of the Northwest Territories]] until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta becomes a Province&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/becoming_province.html|title=Alberta becomes a Province|publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alberta is bordered by the provinces of [[British Columbia]] to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the [[Northwest Territories]] to the north, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces. It has a predominantly [[humid continental climate]], with stark contrasts over a year; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east, due to winters being warmed by occasional [[chinook wind]]s bringing sudden warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/chinook-winds-and-alberta-weather/43265|title=Chinook winds and Alberta weather|author=Erin Wenckstern|publisher=The Weather Network|date=January 8, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta's capital, [[Edmonton]], is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's [[Petroleum|crude oil]], the [[Athabasca oil sands]] and other northern resource industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB_CEO_Reserve&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=NEB|title=Canadian Energy Overview 2007|publisher=National Energy Board of Canada|date=May 2008|url=http://www.neb.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rnrgynfmtn/nrgyrprt/nrgyvrvw/cndnnrgyvrvw2007/cndnnrgyvrvw2007-eng.html#s4_2 |accessdate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About {{cvt|290|km|0}} south of the capital is [[Calgary]], the [[List of cities in Alberta|largest city in Alberta]]. Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two [[census metropolitan area]]s, both of which have populations exceeding one million,&lt;ref name=StatCan2011CMAs/&gt; while the province has [[List of census agglomerations in Alberta|16 census agglomerations]].&lt;ref name=2011censusCAs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&amp;T=202&amp;SR=1&amp;S=0&amp;O=D&amp;RPP=50&amp;CMA=0&amp;PR=48|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, 2011 and 2006 censuses (Alberta)|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourist destinations in the province include [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], [[Drumheller]], [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]], [[Sylvan Lake, Alberta|Sylvan Lake]] and [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]]. Alberta is [[List of World Heritage Sites in Canada|home to six]] [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site|Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], the [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]], [[Waterton–Glacier International Peace Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], and [[Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park|Writing-on-Stone / Áísínai'pi]].

==Etymology==
Alberta was named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848–1939),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/history.cfm |title=History |publisher=[[Government of Alberta]] |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726192134/http://alberta.ca/history.cfm |archivedate=July 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. Princess Louise was the wife of [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne]], [[Governor General of Canada]] (1878–83). [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]] and [[Mount Alberta]] were also named in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertacentennial.ca/history/viewpost.aspx~id=249.html |title=A land of freedom and beauty, named for love |publisher=Government of Alberta |year=2002 |accessdate=January 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311014923/http://www.albertacentennial.ca/history/viewpost.aspx~id%3D249.html |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlaceNames&gt;{{cite book | authors=Larry Donovan &amp; Tom Monto | title=Alberta Place Names: The Fascinating People &amp; Stories Behind the Naming of Alberta | publisher=Dragon Hill Publishing Ltd. | year=2006 | page=121 | isbn=1-896124-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name &quot;Alberta&quot; itself is a feminine [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of the name [[Albert (given name)|Albert]] (cf. masculine ''[[Albertus (given name)|Albertus]]'' in [[Medieval Latin]]) and its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates, ultimately derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Aþalaberhtaz'' (compound of &quot;noble&quot; + &quot;bright/famous&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthename.com/name/albert|title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Albert|first=Mike|last=Campbell|website=Behind the Name}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/alberta|title=Alberta &amp;#124; Origin and meaning of the name Alberta by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Alberta}}
[[File:AB-physical map.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Topographic map]] of Alberta]]
Alberta, with an area of {{convert|661848|km2|-2|abbr=on}}, is the fourth-largest province after [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]] and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=area&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|title=Land and freshwater area, by province and territory|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=February 2005|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta's southern border is the [[49th parallel north]], which separates it from the U.S. state of Montana; while the [[60th parallel north]] divides it from the [[Northwest Territories]]. The [[110th meridian west]] separates it from the province of [[Saskatchewan]]; while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the [[120th meridian west]] south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Alberta-province|title=Alberta, Canada|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The province extends {{cvt|1223|km}} north to south and {{cvt|660|km}} east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is {{cvt|3747|m|0}} at the summit of [[Mount Columbia (Canada)|Mount Columbia]] in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is {{cvt|152|m|0}} on the [[Slave River]] in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in the northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|title=Climate and Geography|work=About Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|year=2008|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-INTER-AB/STAGING/texte-text/fnamarch11_1315587933961_eng.pdf|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate [[water resources]]. There are numerous [[list of rivers of Alberta|rivers]] and [[list of lakes in Alberta|lakes]] used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, [[Lake Claire (Alberta)|Lake Claire]] ({{convert|1436|km2|abbr=on}}) in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], [[Lesser Slave Lake]] ({{convert|1168|km2|abbr=on}}), and [[Lake Athabasca]] ({{convert|7898|km2}}) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the [[Athabasca River]] which travels {{cvt|1538|km}} from the [[Columbia Icefield]] in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athabasca River|publisher=The Canadian Heritage Rivers System|year=2011|url=http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Athabasca/Athabasca-F_e.php|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest river is the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] with an average flow of 2161 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. The [[Peace River]] originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the [[Slave River]], a tributary of the [[Mackenzie River]].

Alberta's capital city, Edmonton, is located at about the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. Calgary is about {{cvt|280|km}} south of Edmonton and {{cvt|240|km}} north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the [[Calgary–Edmonton Corridor]]. The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://railways.library.ualberta.ca/Maps-2-2-5|title=Atlas of Alberta Railways Maps – Alberta Land Grants |work=ualberta.ca|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1 moraine lake pano 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Moraine Lake]] at [[Banff National Park]]. The [[Alberta Mountain forests]] makes up the southwestern boundary of Alberta.]]
Most of the northern half of the province is [[Taiga|boreal forest]], while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see [[Alberta Mountain forests]] and [[Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests]]). The southern quarter of the province is [[prairie]], ranging from [[shortgrass prairie]] in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central [[aspen parkland]] region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to [[Lloydminster]], contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to [[dairy farming]], with [[mixed farming]] more common in the north and centre, while [[ranch]]ing and [[Irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] predominate in the south.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Alberta|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada|year=2008|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alberta|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alberta [[badlands]] are located in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.

=== Climate ===
Alberta has a [[humid continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from {{convert|-54|C|sigfig=2}} in northern Alberta to {{convert|-46|C|sigfig=2}} in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare.
[[File:Alberta Köppen.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in Alberta]]
In the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from {{convert|32|C}} in the mountains to over {{convert|40|C}} in southeastern Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;climatlas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate of Alberta|work=Agroclimatic Atlas of Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|year=2003|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sag6299|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;climatlas&quot;/&gt;

Alberta extends for over {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from {{convert|0|C|sigfig=2}} in the southwest to {{convert|-24|C|sigfig=2}} in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[Westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} in the southeast to {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach {{convert|600|mm|abbr=on}} annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberta Weather and Climate Data|publisher=Government of Alberta, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development|year=2012|url=http://agriculture.alberta.ca/acis|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The province is the namesake of the [[Alberta clipper]], a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar [[Jet stream|jetstream]] descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta Clipper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberta Clipper|url=http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219182706/http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archivedate=2015-02-19|publisher=The Weather Notebook|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around {{convert|21|C}} in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around {{convert|28|C}} in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding.

In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry [[chinook wind]]s blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at [[Pincher Creek]], temperatures soared from {{convert|-19|to|22|C|sigfig=2}} in just one hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;/&gt; The region around [[Lethbridge]] has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year. Calgary has a 56% chance of a [[white Christmas (weather)|white Christmas]], while Edmonton has an 86% chance.&lt;ref name=Canadawhitechristmas&gt;{{cite web|title=Chance of White Christmas|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=642F4B39-1|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=December 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301190705/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En|archivedate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (23221954989).jpg|thumb|Southeastern Alberta features a [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate.]]
Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has a [[subarctic climate]]. The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that [[evapotranspiration|evaporates or is used by plants]]. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the [[Palliser's Triangle|Palliser Triangle]], experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent [[crop yield]] problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a [[biome]] transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.

After Saskatchewan, Alberta experiences the most [[tornado]]es in Canada with an average of 15 verified per year.&lt;ref name=tornados&gt;{{cite web|last=Vettese|first=Dayna|title=Tornadoes in Canada: Everything you need to know|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/tornadoes-in-canada-everything-you-need-to-know/25876/0|publisher=[[The Weather Network]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary–Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada, which is caused by [[orographic lift]]ing from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

[[File:Rosa acicularis 8448.JPG|thumb|The [[Rosa acicularis|wild rose]] is the provincial flower of Alberta.]]
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus [[anemone]]; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March, though April is the usual month for the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plantwatch.naturealberta.ca/plant-information/prairie-crocus Prairie Crocus Information] Alberta Plant Watch.

Both yellow and white [[Melilotus|sweet clover]] can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.

The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] (or in some parts [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]]), and [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Pinophyta|Conifers]] include [[jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[Larix laricina|tamarack]].

==== Fauna ====
[[File:Bighorn Sheep - Kananaskis.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bighorn sheep|bighorner]] in [[Kananaskis Country]]. The bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta.]]
The four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[Taiga|boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

[[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tailed deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]].

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], fox, [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[Cougar|mountain lion]] (cougar).
[[File:Bear-Proof Garbage Can Lake Louise.jpg|thumb|A bear-proof garbage can in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]]. Bears are found in the province's wooded and mountainous areas.]]
Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[Esox|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. [[Bull trout]], native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument | title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta| publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1950s, the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats were

=== Paleontology ===
[[File:Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.jpg|thumb|Specimens at the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology]], located in the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] at [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]]]]
Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of [[Late Cretaceous]] dinosaur fossils in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; [[Taxon|Taxa]] are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even [[Bone bed|mass graves]]. At least 38 dinosaur [[Type (biology)|type specimens]] were collected in the province. The [[Foremost Formation]], [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur-bearing strata in Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt;

Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The Dinosaur Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation. In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent [[Scollard Formation]] outcrops. In the [[Drumheller]] Valley and [[Edmonton]] regions there are exposed [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation|Horseshoe Canyon]] [[facies]]. Other [[Geological formation|formations]] have been recorded as well, like the [[Milk River Formation|Milk River]] and Foremost Formations. However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops. Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites. Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the [[Belly River Group]] and [[St. Mary River Formation]]s of the southwest and the northwestern [[Wapiti Formation]]. The Wapiti Formation contains two ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however. The [[Bearpaw Formation]] represents strata deposited during a [[marine transgression]]. Dinosaurs are known from this formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older [[sediment]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot;&gt;Ryan, M. J., and Russell, A.

[[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]]. They are thought to have migrated from [[Siberia]] to [[Alaska]] on a [[Beringia|land bridge]] across the [[Bering Strait]] and then possibly moved down the east side of the Rocky Mountains through Alberta to [[Settlement of the Americas|settle the Americas]]. Others may have [[Coastal Migration#Coastal migration hypothesis in the New World|migrated down the coast]] of British Columbia and then moved inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Canada's First Nations | work=Applied History | publisher=University of Calgary | year=2000 | url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/firstnations/theories.html | accessdate=February 1, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221041745/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/firstnations/theories.html |archivedate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time they differentiated into various [[First Nations]] peoples, including the [[Plains Indians|Plains Indian]] tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]] and the [[Plains Cree]], who generally lived by hunting buffalo, and the more northerly tribes such as the [[Woodland Cree]] and [[Chipewyan]] who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;/&gt;

After the [[British America|British arrival in Canada]], approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the [[Athabasca River]] drainage, became part of [[Rupert's Land]] which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into [[Hudson Bay]]. This area was granted by [[Charles II of England]] to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it.

[[File:North-western-territory.png|thumb|left|From 1670 to 1870, southern Alberta formed a part of [[Rupert's Land]] whereas northern Alberta formed a part of the [[North-Western Territory]].]]

The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first European explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who learned of the [[Methye Portage]], which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the [[North West Company]] (NWC) of [[Montreal]] to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]] in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the [[Mackenzie River]]—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2521 | title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography | dictionary=Dictionary of Canadian Biography | accessdate=January 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], [[Louisiana Purchase|sold to the United States]] in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the [[49th parallel north|Forty-Ninth Parallel]] was ceded to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kennedy | first1=D. | last2=Cohen | first2=L. | last3=Bailey | first3=T. | title=The American Pageant: Volume I: To 1877 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwP8bQsT908C&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=1818,+louisiana,+forty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4uGtU-7uFpebqAbVxIGwDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1818%2C%20louisiana%2C%20forty&amp;f=false | publisher=Cengage Learning | date=2010 | location=Boston, MA | page=265 | isbn=978-0-547-16659-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Alberta was included in the [[North-Western Territory]] until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's [[Northwest Territories]].

The [[District of Alberta]] was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] as the first premier. Less than a decade later, the [[World War I|First World War]] presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production. Over 50% of Alberta's doctors volunteered for service overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Calgary, Edmonton and the University of Alberta: the extraordinary medical mobilization by Canada's newest province |journal= Can J Surg |year=2017 |page=296 |volume=60 |doi=10.1503/cjs.012117 |pmc=5608576 |pmid=28930035 | last1 = Da Cambra | first1 = MP | last2 = McAlister | first2 = VC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alberta population.svg|thumb|Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.]]

The [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]] reported Alberta had a population of 4,067,175 living in 1,527,678 of its 1,654,129 total dwellings, an 11.6% change from its 2011 population of 3,645,257. With a land area of {{convert|640330.46|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it had a population density of {{Pop density|4067175|640330.46|km2|sqmi|prec=1}} in 2016.&lt;ref name=Alberta/&gt; [[Statistics Canada]] estimated the province to have a population of 4,362,503 in Q2 of 2019.&lt;ref name=StatCan2017Q1Est/&gt;

Since 2000, Alberta's population has experienced a relatively high rate of growth, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of [[Interprovincial migration in Canada|interprovincial migration]] compared to other provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Components of population growth of Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm | title=Components of population growth, by province and territory | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=August 7, 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930052549/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Alberta continued to have the youngest population among the provinces with a median age of 36.7 years, compared with the national median of 41.2 years. Also in 2016, Alberta had the smallest proportion of seniors (12.3%) among the provinces and one of the highest population shares of children (19.2%), further contributing to Alberta's young and growing population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/osi/census/2016/2016-census-age-and-sex.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjxwIbU_tXaAhUX9mMKHRMYAZ8QFjABegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw36HJ1z32Av7zWr9KrHZhq4 |title=2016 Census of Canada – age and sex release – Alberta Treasury Board and Finance |publisher=Alberta Treasury Board and Finance / Statistics Canada |accessdate=25 April 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the population. The next most common mother tongues were [[Chinese language|Chinese]] with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Detailed Mother Tongue Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/tbt/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=838045&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=89201&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=88971,97154&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;THEME=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= | title=Detailed Mother Tongue (186), Knowledge of Official Languages (5), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2001 and 2006 Censuses – 20% Sample Data | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mother tongues include: [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], with 29,740 (0.92%); [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); [[Polish language|Polish]], with 21,990 (0.68%); [[Arabic]], with 20,495 (0.64%); [[Dutch language|Dutch]], with 19,980 (0.62%); and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], with 19,350 (0.60%).

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many are descended from immigrants of Western European nations, notably [[English Canadians|England]], [[Scottish Canadians|Scotland]], [[Irish Canadians|Ireland]], [[Welsh Canadians|Wales]] and [[French Canadians|France]], but large numbers later came from other regions of Europe, notably [[German Canadians|Germany]], [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukraine]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables | work=2006 Census | publisher=Statistics Canada | year=2008 | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/index.cfm?Lang=E | accessdate =August 19, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second-highest proportion (two percent) of [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]] in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of [[Franco-Albertans|Alberta's French-speaking residents]] live in the central and northwestern regions of the province, after migration from other areas of Canada or descending from Métis.

As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic [[Chinatown]]s, and Calgary has Canada's third-largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. [[First Nations in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2006 [[Census in Canada|Canadian census]], the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 English (27.2%); 679,705 German (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 Scottish (20.3%); 539,160 Irish (16.6%); 388,210 French (11.9%); 332,180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172,910 [[Dutch Canadians|Dutch]] (5.3%); 170,935 [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] (5.2%); 169,355 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Indian]] (5.2%); 144,585 [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] (4.4%); and 137,600 [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese]] (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=48&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000 | title=Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst those of British heritage, the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], and Banff having [[List of Scottish place names in Canada|Scottish]] origins.

Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of [[Visible minority|visible minorities]] after British Columbia and [[Ontario]] with 13.9% of the population consisting of visible minorities in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visible minority groups Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-562/p14-eng.cfm | title=Canada's Ethnocultural Mosaic, 2006 Census: Provinces and territories | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over one third of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visible minority groups, percentage distribution Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=CSD&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;Data=Dist&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=5&amp;Display=Page&amp;CSDFilter=5000 | title=Visible minority groups, percentage distribution (2006), for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities) with 5,000-plus population – 20% sample data | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboriginal Identity Peoples made up 5.8% of the population in 2006, about half of whom consist of First Nations and the other half are [[Métis in Canada|Métis]]. There are also small number of [[Inuit]] people in Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aboriginal identity population by age groups Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-558/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;Data=Count&amp;Sex=1&amp;Age=1&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;Display=Page | title=Aboriginal identity population by age groups, median age and sex, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aboriginal identity population by age groups Alberta&quot;/&gt;

As of the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 National Household Survey]], the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 24.3% of the population. Alberta had the second-highest percentage of [[Irreligion|non-religious]] residents among the provinces (after British Columbia) at 31.6% of the population. Of the remainder, 7.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the [[United Church of Canada]], while 3.9% were [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]]. [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] made up 3.3% of the population while [[Baptists]] comprised 1.9%.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS Profile, Alberta, 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=48&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Alberta&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=All&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=48 | title=NHS Profile, Alberta, 2011 | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province. Alberta has a population of [[Hutterite]]s, a communal [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] sect similar to the [[Mennonite]]s, and has a significant population of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. Alberta is home to several [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]'s [[Ukrainian Orthodox Eparchy of Western Canada|Western Diocese]] which is based in Edmonton.

Muslims made up 3.2% of the population, Sikhs 1.5%, Buddhists 1.2%, and Hindus 1.0%. Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies. Canada's oldest mosque, the [[Al-Rashid Mosque]], is located in Edmonton,&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Rashid Mosque&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://muslim-canada.org/alrashidmosque.html | title=Al-Rashid Mosque | publisher=Canadian Islamic Congress | accessdate=August 7, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305234233/http://muslim-canada.org/alrashidmosque.html | archive-date=March 5, 2009 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Calgary is home to Canada's largest mosque, the [[Baitun Nur Mosque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baitun Nur&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=c1ce5c3b-de23-4093-85b8-36162ac636a6 |title=Politicians and faithful open Canada's largest mosque |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |date=July 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012150130/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=c1ce5c3b-de23-4093-85b8-36162ac636a6 |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta is also home to a growing [[Jews|Jewish]] population of about 15,400 people who constituted 0.3% of Alberta's population.

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).&lt;ref name=&quot;CECorridor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm |title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor |work=Statistics Canada, 2001 Census of Population |date=January 20, 2003 |accessdate=March 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223191204/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm |archivedate=February 23, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style [[quality of life]], offering [[universal health care]] benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other [[List of cities in Canada|Canadian cities]] at that time.

In 2014, Merchandise exports totalled US$121.4 billion. Energy revenues totalled $111.7 billion and Energy resource exports totalled $90.8 billion. Farm Cash receipts from agricultural products totalled $12.9 billion. Shipments of forest products totalled $5.4 billion while exports were $2.7 billion. Manufacturing sales totaled $79.4 billion, and Alberta's ICT industries generated over $13 billion in revenue. In total, Alberta's 2014 GDP amassed $364.5 billion in 2007 dollars, or $414.3 billion in 2015 dollars. In 2015, Alberta's GDP grew despite low oil prices; however, it was unstable with growth rates as high 4.4% and as low as 0.2%. Should the GDP remain at an average of 2.2% for the last two quarters of 2015, Alberta's GDP should exceed $430 billion by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;albertacanada.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertacanada.com/business/statistics/economic-highlights.aspx|title=Economic highlights|first=Government of|last=Alberta|date=December 12, 2017|website=albertacanada.com|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703162735/http://albertacanada.com/business/statistics/economic-highlights.aspx|archive-date=July 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/|title=Inflation Calculator|website=www.bankofcanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, RBC Economics research predicts Alberta's real GDP growth to only average 0.6% for the last two quarters of 2015.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===
[[File:Cows in the Foothills - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Cows in [[Rocky View County|Rocky View]]. Nearly one-half of Canadian beef is produced in Alberta.]]
Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of cattle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$Department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb13754 | title=Alberta Livestock Inspections – October 2011 | date=November 24, 2011 | publisher=Government of Alberta | accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the top producers of plains [[American bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.

Wheat and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other [[cereal|grains]] are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerson|first1=Jen|title=Preserving prairie cathedrals: Progress is leaving Alberta's historic grain elevators in its wake|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/preserving-prairie-cathedrals-progress-is-leaving-albertas-historic-grain-elevators-in-its-wake|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=National Post|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.|date=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beekeeping in Alberta|url=http://www.agric.gov.ab.ca/content/ag_in_alberta_beekeeping|website=Government of Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Canola in Alberta Canada.jpg|thumb|left|A [[canola]] field in Alberta]]
Forestry plays a vital role in Alberta's economy, providing over 15,000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.ab.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agric.gov.ab.ca/app21/forestrypage?cat1=Forest+Business|title=Agriculture and Forestry – Forest Business|website=www.agric.gov.ab.ca|access-date=December 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004130726/http://www.agric.gov.ab.ca/app21/forestrypage?cat1=Forest+Business|archive-date=October 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uses for harvested timber include [[pulpwood]], [[hardwood]], [[engineered wood]] and [[bioproducts]] such as chemicals and [[biofuels]].

=== Industry ===
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], natural gas and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world's second-largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth-largest producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska and Alberta - An Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://economic.alberta.ca/documents/Alaska-AB.pdf| title=Alaska – Alberta Relations| publisher=Government of Alberta| accessdate=May 19, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611125209/http://economic.alberta.ca/documents/Alaska-AB.pdf| archive-date=June 11, 2016| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, [[polyethylene]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton.
[[File:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|[[Syncrude]]'s Mildred Lake mining site and plant at the [[Athabasca oil sands]]]]
The [[Athabasca oil sands]] surrounding [[Fort McMurray]] have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[Petroleum|conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6&amp;nbsp;trillion barrels (254&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[Asphalt|bitumen]] from the [[oil sands]]. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canada's Oil and Gas Industry&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.buyusa.gov/montana/canadaoilsands.html | title=Canada Oilsands Opportunities | publisher=U.S. Commercial Service | accessdate=August 9, 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206021755/http://www.buyusa.gov/montana/canadaoilsands.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss. By mid-2014, however, rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects. An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn north project in the Athabasca region in May 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;TotalJoslyn&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Cost escalation leads Total to put Joslyn oil sands project on hold | url=https://edmontonjournal.com/business/layoff+talk+swirls+Total+update+Joslyn+oilsands+status/9888984/story.html | accessdate=June 14, 2014 | newspaper=Edmonton Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid-crystal display]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130809034342/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system]—US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263;  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215131340/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html |date=February 15, 2009}}—SMART Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Alberta}}
[[File:Three Sisters from Police Creek.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[The Three Sisters (Alberta)|The Three Sisters]] at [[Bow Valley Provincial Park]] in [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]]]]
Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as [[West Edmonton Mall]], [[Calgary Stampede]], outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] and Olympic Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] and the [[Canadian Rockies|Rocky Mountains]] are visited by about three million people per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geography &amp; Climate:Encourage Canadian Immigration&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.akcanada.com/lic_alberta.cfm | title=Living in Canada : Alberta | publisher=AKCanada | accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta tourism relies heavily on [[Southern Ontario]] tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many other countries.

There are also natural attractions like [[Elk Island National Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], and the [[Columbia Icefield]]. [[Alberta's Rockies]] include well-known tourist destinations [[Banff National Park]] and [[Jasper National Park]]. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic [[Icefields Parkway]]. Banff is located {{cvt|128|km}} west of Calgary on [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway&amp;nbsp;1]], and Jasper is located {{cvt|366|km}} west of Edmonton on [[Yellowhead Highway]]. Five of Canada's fourteen [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World heritage sites]] are located within the province: [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site|Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], Wood Buffalo National Park, [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] and [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]]. A number of these areas hold ski resorts, most notably [[Sunshine Village]], [[Lake Louise Ski Resort|Lake Louise]], [[Marmot Basin]], [[Mount Norquay ski resort|Norquay]] and [[Nakiska]].
[[File:Bronco stampede01c.jpg|thumb|Bronco riding at the [[Calgary Stampede]]. The event is one of the world's largest [[rodeos]].]]
About 1.2 million people visit the Calgary Stampede,&lt;ref name=&quot;Landmark Stampede Dates&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://corporate.calgarystampede.com/about/stampede-history/ | title=History of the Stampede | publisher=Calgary Stampede | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a celebration of Canada's own Wild West and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's [[K-Days]] (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX).&lt;ref name=KDays&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/festivals/Capital+named+Days/7002873/story.html |title=Capital Ex to be named K-Days (Poll) |author=Manisha Krishnan |newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]] |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |date=July 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731233950/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/festivals/Capital%2Bnamed%2BDays/7002873/story.html |archivedate=July 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://k-days.com/info/ | title=K-Days Edmonton | publisher=Northlands | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[Gold mining|gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. [[Drumheller]], &quot;Dinosaur Capital of The World&quot;, offers the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]]. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years. Another attraction in east-central Alberta is [[Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions]], a popular tourist attraction operated out of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]], that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}{{See also|List of Alberta Premiers|List of Alberta general elections|Executive Council of Alberta}}
The Government of Alberta is organized as a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy with a unicameral legislature. Its [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature—the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]]—consists of 87 members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home | title=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | work=assembly.ab.ca | accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.
[[File:Alberta Legislature Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Alberta Legislative Building]] serves as the meeting place for the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].]]
As [[Queen of Canada]], [[Elizabeth II]] is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor [[Lois Mitchell]]. The Queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the Queen. The government is headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and draws all the members of the Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta. The current premier is [[Jason Kenney]], sworn in on April&amp;nbsp;30, 2019.

Alberta's elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces. Since the 1960s, Alberta has had three main political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (&quot;Conservatives&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic New Democrats. The [[Wildrose Party]], a more conservative party formed in early 2008, gained much support in the [[2012 Alberta General Election|2012 election]] and became the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|official opposition]], a role it held until 2017 when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new [[United Conservative Party]] created by the merger of Wildrose and the Progressive Conservatives. The strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]] was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971.

For 44 years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta. They lost the [[2015 Alberta general election|2015 election]] to the NDP (which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history, breaking almost 80 consecutive years of right-wing rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/albertas-rae-days-the-2018-budget-shows-rachel-is-just-like-bob |title=Alberta’s Rae Days—the 2018 budget shows Rachel is just like Bob |last=Eisen |first=Ben |publisher=Fraser Institute |date=March 31, 2018 |access-date=September 22, 2018 |quote=When Rachel Notley’s NDP shook Alberta’s political landscape by winning a majority government in 2015, the similarities to Ontario’s Bob Rae NDP government in the 1990s were striking. Both cases marked the first NDP government in provincial history, and both brought an end to Progressive Conservative dynasties (though in the case of Ontario, the beginning of the end had come a few years earlier when David Peterson formed a minority Liberal government).}}&lt;/ref&gt;), suggesting at the time a possible shift to the left in the province, also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of Alberta's major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/alberta-election-ndp-win-gary-mason/article24270855/ | title=An NDP victory changes everything Canadians think about Alberta | author=Gary Mason | date=May 5, 2015 | accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since becoming a province in 1905, Alberta has seen only five changes of government—only six parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971; the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015; from 2015 to 2019, the Alberta New Democratic Party; and currently, from 2019, the United Conservative Party.

=== Law enforcement ===
[[File:RCMP officers Beth, Janice &amp; Harp 2.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers in [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. The RCMP provides municipal policing throughout most of Alberta.]]
Policing in the province of Alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the [[North-West Mounted Police|Royal Northwest Mounted Police]]. In 1917, due to pressures of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], the [[Alberta Provincial Police]] was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a [[Great Depression]] era cost cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the now renamed [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP &quot;K&quot; Division. With the advent of the [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], the distribution of duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforcement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the Premier of Alberta have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the [[Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams]] (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it. ALERT is made up of members of the RCMP, Sheriffs Branch and various major municipal police forces in Alberta.

=== Taxation ===
According to Alberta's 2009 budget, government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).&lt;ref name=&quot;budget2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Building On Our Strength|url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2009/index.html|website=Finance Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Alberta received $6.1 billion in bitumen royalties.

In 2001, Alberta became the only Canadian province to have a [[flat tax]] of 10% of taxable income, which was introduced by then-Premier, [[Ralph Klein]], as part of the Alberta Tax Advantage, which also included a zero-percent tax on income below a &quot;generous personal exemption&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;macleans_Teds_20180509&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/the-winners-and-losers-if-alberta-returns-to-a-flat-tax-system/ |title=The winners and losers if Alberta returns to a flat tax system |first=Lindsay |last=Tedds |quote=&quot;As the province debates the merits of a less progressive tax system, voters will have to make tradeoffs that help and punish different income earners&quot; |date=May 9, 2018 |access-date=May 21, 2019 |magazine=Macleans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRA_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html | title=What are the income tax rates in Canada for 2009? | publisher=Canada Revenue Agency | accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRA_2009&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Culture of Alberta}}
{{See also|Festivals in Alberta}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival|Edmonton Fringe Festival]] is the world's second-largest after the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events, including folk music festivals. The city's &quot;heritage days&quot; festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmonton's [[Churchill Square (Edmonton)|Churchill Square]] is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton &amp; [[The Works Art &amp; Design Festival]] throughout the summer months.

The City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede, dubbed &quot;The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth&quot;. The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as [[calf roping]] and [[bull riding]]. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.
[[File:Oilers vs. Flames Pre-Season (29598440984).jpg|thumb|An ice hockey game between the [[Calgary Flames]], and the [[Edmonton Oilers]], two teams in the [[National Hockey League]]]]
The [[Banff Centre]] hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international [[Banff Mountain Film Festival|Mountain Film Festival]]. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams (the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]]/[[Calgary Flames|Flames]] and [[Edmonton Eskimos|Eskimos]]/[[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]] respectively). Soccer, [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta.

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Alberta}}
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).

=== Elementary and secondary ===
There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St.&amp;nbsp;Albert]]) has a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

[[State school|Public]] and separate school boards, [[charter school]]s, and [[private school]]s all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). [[Homeschooling|Homeschool]] tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

=== Post-secondary ===
{{Main|Higher education in Alberta}}
[[File:U of A.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Alberta]] in 2005. The institution is the oldest, and largest university in Alberta.]]
The [[University of Alberta]], located in Edmonton and established in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second-largest university in Alberta. [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]] are located in Athabasca and Lethbridge respectively.

In early September 2009, [[Mount Royal University]] became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made [[MacEwan University]] Edmonton's second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Service Centres&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/e927d868-7fda-4f5b-bb35-ed1b097785f2/resource/5f46b737-0a47-4a9a-b2cf-41a16b22dc20/download/5288529-2012-10-facts-on-Alberta.pdf| title=Service Centres | publisher=Government of Alberta | accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the colleges, Red Deer College and Grande Prairie Regional College, were approved by the Alberta government to become degree granting universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rdc.ab.ca/about/news-events/rdc-news/rdcs-future-today-start-our-university-journey|title=RDC's Future - Today is the start of our University journey - Red Deer College|website=rdc.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also many private post-secondary institutions, mostly [[List of colleges in Alberta#Private Colleges|Christian Universities]], bringing the total number of universities to 12. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier [[Ralph Klein]] made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.su.ualberta.ca/governance/advocacy/ |title=Advocacy | publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&amp;articleID=276&amp;month=2&amp;day=16&amp;year=2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810035239/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&amp;articleID=276&amp;month=2&amp;day=16&amp;year=2005 | archivedate=2013-08-10 | title=Klein promises tuition freeze | last=Bellamy | first=Marshall | publisher=The Gazette | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==
{{See also|Health care in Canada}}
Alberta provides a [[publicly funded health care]] system, [[Alberta Health Services]], for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the ''[[Canada Health Act]]'' of 1984. Alberta became Canada's second province (after [[Saskatchewan]]) to adopt a [[Tommy Douglas]]-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] system.

Alberta's health care budget was $22.5&amp;nbsp;billion during the 2018–2019 fiscal year (approximately 45% of all government spending), making it the best-funded health-care system per-capita in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alberta.ca/albertaFiles/googlesearch/searchpage.aspx?q=health+funding+2013-2014+site%253Ahealth.alberta.ca&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ud=1&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;client=goa_default&amp;proxystylesheet=goa_default&amp;num=10&amp;sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&amp;wc=200&amp;wc_mc=1&amp;exclude_apps=1&amp;site=pub_goa|title=Government of Alberta|date=2011-11-07|access-date=2016-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211185221/https://www.alberta.ca/albertaFiles/googlesearch/searchpage.aspx?q=health+funding+2013-2014+site%253Ahealth.alberta.ca&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ud=1&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;client=goa_default&amp;proxystylesheet=goa_default&amp;num=10&amp;sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&amp;wc=200&amp;wc_mc=1&amp;exclude_apps=1&amp;site=pub_goa|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every hour the province spends more than $2.5 million, (or $60 million per day), to maintain and improve health care in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta Health Funding: Budget 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding.html|title=Health Funding: Budget 2018|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=April 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107005335/http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding.html|archive-date=January 7, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major U.S. centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary Airport Authority&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yyc.com/ | title=Calgary Airport Authority | publisher=Calgary Airport Authority | accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major U.S. airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flyeia.com/ | title=EIA | publisher=Edmonton International Airport | accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transit===
Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial [[Public transport|public transit]] systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate [[Light rail|light rail transit]] (LRT) systems. [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit|Edmonton LRT]], which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the [[Central business district|CBD]], was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary [[C-Train]] has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.

===Rail===

There are more than {{cvt|9000|km}} of operating mainline railway in Alberta. The vast majority of this trackage is owned by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] companies, which operate railway [[Cargo|freight]] across the province. Additional railfreight service in the province is provided by two shortline railways: the [[Battle River Railway]] and [[Forty Mile Rail]]. Passenger trains include [[Via Rail]]'s Canadian (Toronto–Vancouver) or Jasper–Prince Rupert trains, which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes. The [[Rocky Mountaineer]] operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper.

[[Alberta Highway 4|Highway&amp;nbsp;4]], which effectively extends [[Interstate 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&amp;nbsp;3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod]] and links Highway&amp;nbsp;2 to Highway&amp;nbsp;4.

North of Edmonton, the highway continues to [[Athabasca, Alberta|Athabasca]], then northwesterly along the south shore of [[Lesser Slave Lake]] into [[High Prairie]], north to [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]], west to [[Fairview, Alberta|Fairview]] and finally south to [[Grande Prairie]], where it ends at an interchange with [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway&amp;nbsp;43]].&lt;ref name=highwaychart/&gt; The section of Highway&amp;nbsp;2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=18089FD23DB4D-FD6C-4FCB-BF561512BB437544 | publisher=Alberta Transportation | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325212610/http://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=18089FD23DB4D-FD6C-4FCB-BF561512BB437544 | archivedate=2016-03-25 |date=2005-05-23 |title=Highway 2 receives 'Royal' treatment |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2016-11-04 |quote=Highway 2 between Edmonton and Calgary is now known as the Queen Elizabeth II Highway.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highway&amp;nbsp;2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: [[Alberta Highway 22|Highway 22]], west of Highway&amp;nbsp;2, known as ''Cowboy Trail'', and [[Alberta Highway 21|Highway&amp;nbsp;21]], east of Highway&amp;nbsp;2. Highway&amp;nbsp;43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the [[Peace River Country]]; [[Alberta Highway 63|Highway 63]] travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the Athabasca oil sands.&lt;ref name=highwaychart/&gt;

Alberta has two main east–west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway&amp;nbsp;16]]), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into British Columbia.&lt;ref name=highwaychart/&gt; One of the most scenic drives is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs for {{cvt|228|km}} between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length. A third corridor stretches across southern Alberta; [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&amp;nbsp;3]] runs between Crowsnest Pass and Medicine Hat through Lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the [[Crowsnest Highway]].&lt;ref name=highwaychart/&gt; Another major corridor through central Alberta is [[Alberta Highway 11|Highway&amp;nbsp;11]] (also known as the [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] Highway), which runs east from the [[Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta|Saskatchewan River Crossing]] in Banff National Park through [[Rocky Mountain House]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], connecting with [[Alberta Highway 12|Highway&amp;nbsp;12]] {{cvt|20|km}} west of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]]. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway&amp;nbsp;2 just west of Red Deer.&lt;ref name=highwaychart/&gt;

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called ''trails''. For example, Highway&amp;nbsp;2, the main north–south highway in the province, is called [[Deerfoot Trail]] as it passes through Calgary but becomes [[Calgary Trail]] (for southbound traffic) and [[Gateway Boulevard]] (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban [[limited-access road|expressway]]s ''trails'' and naming many of them after prominent [[First Nations]] individuals and tribes, such as [[Crowchild Trail]], Deerfoot Trail, and [[Stoney Trail]].&lt;ref name=Calgarymap&gt;{{cite web|title=Calgary, Alberta |url=https://www.google.ca/maps/@50.9896374,-114.0667851,9.75z?hl=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008133612/https://www.google.ca/maps/@50.9896374,-114.0667851,9.75z?hl=en |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-10-08 |website=[[Google Maps]] |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=2016-12-08 |df=mdy-all |format=Map }}&lt;/ref&gt;
