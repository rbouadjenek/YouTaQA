In [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolters&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wolters Kluwer Bouvier Law Dictionary: Desk Edition|last=Sheppard|first=Stephen Michael|date=21 May 2012|publisher=Aspen Publishers|isbn=9781454806110|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstract of title==
{{Main|Abstract of title}}
The Abstract of Title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage law|mortgages]], and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolters&quot;/&gt;

==Clear title==
{{Unreferenced section|type=Law|date=November 2007}}
A clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks{{Clarify|reason= does this mean &quot;it shews an unbroken chain&quot;?|date=February 2011}}in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

==Patent law==
In the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in United States patent law) of an invention. Under [[United States patent law]], the abstract may be called &quot;Abstract of the Disclosure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0600_608_01_b.htm 608.01(b) Abstract of the Disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;37 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/1.72  1.72 - Title and abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative process==
Certain government bureaucracies, such as a ''department of motor vehicles'' will issue an '''abstract''' of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. This is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.
