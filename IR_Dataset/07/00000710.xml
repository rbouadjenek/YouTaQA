{{Politics of Angola}}
The '''foreign relations of Angola''' are based on Angola's strong support of [[U.S. foreign policy]] as the [[Angolan economy]] is dependent on U.S. foreign aid.

From 1975 to 1989, [[Angola]] was aligned with the [[Eastern bloc]], in particular the [[Soviet Union]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2012)|Libya]], and [[Cuba]]. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with [[Western world|Western countries]], cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in [[Central Africa]] through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]]. It has entered the [[Southern African Development Community]] as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]] joined Angola in its military intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where Angolan troops remain in support of the [[Joseph Kabila]] government. It also has intervened in the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the [[United Nations Security Council]] to impose and carry out sanctions on [[UNITA]]. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on [[conflict diamonds]], the primary source of revenue for UNITA during the Civil War that ended in 2002. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries ([[CPLP]]) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with [[Portugal]] (its former ruler) and [[Brazil]] (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular.  Angola is a member of the [[Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa]] (PMAESA).

Cape Verde signed a friendship accord with Angola in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and [[Guinea-Bissau]] served as stop-over points for [[Cuban troops]] on their way to Angola to fight [[UNITA]] rebels and [[South Africa]]n troops. [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Pires]] sent [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People|FARP]] soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of [[Angolan President]] [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|year=1995|title=Cape Verde:Crioulo Colony to Independent Nation|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thousands of Angolans fled the country after the civil war. More than 20,000 people were forced to leave the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 2009, an action the DR Congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of Congolese diamond miners who were in Angola illegally. Angola sent a delegation to DR Congo's capital [[Kinshasa]] and succeeded in stopping government-forced expulsions which had become a &quot;tit-for-tat&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bearak&quot; /&gt; immigration dispute. &quot;Congo and Angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border,&quot; said Lambert Mende, DR Congo information minister, in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congo and Angola 'end expulsions' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8304282.stm|date=13 October 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-10-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted — all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes,&quot; Mende said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bearak&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Bearak, Barry|title=Congo and Angola Agree to End Expulsions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/africa/14angola.html|date=13 October 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a request by the government of Guinea-Bissau, Angola sent there a contingent of about 300 troops meant to help putting an end to the political-military unrest in that country, and to reorganize the local military forces. In fact, these troops were perceived as a kind of [[Pretorian Guard]] for the ruling party, [[PAIGC]]. In the beginning of April 2012, when a new military [[Coup d'état]] was under preparation, the Angolan regime decided to withdraw its military mission from Guinea-Bissau.

This affected the [[Angolan Civil War]] that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party [[SWAPO]] sought to support the ruling party [[MPLA]] in Angola against the rebel movement [[UNITA]], whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s UNITA.

Angola-South Africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa who supported them.

Angola-Zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states, Angola in 1975 and Zimbabwe in 1979, during the [[Cold War]].  While Angola's foreign policy shifted to a pro-U.S. stance based on [[Economy of Angola|substantial economic ties]], under the rule of [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] Zimbabwe's ties with the [[Western world|West]] soured in the late 1990s.

From the mid-1980s through at least 1992, the United States was the primary source of military and other support for the [[UNITA]] rebel movement, which was led from its creation through 2002 by [[Jonas Savimbi]].  The U.S. refused to recognize Angola diplomatically during this period.

Relations between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Angola|Republic of Angola]] (formerly the [[People's Republic of Angola]]) have warmed since Angola's ideological renunciation of [[Communism]] before the [[Angolan presidential election, 1992|1992 elections]].
