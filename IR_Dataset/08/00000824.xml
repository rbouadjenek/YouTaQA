'''Altaic''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ᵻ|k}}) is a hypothetical [[language family]] which would include the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolian languages|Mongolian]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language families; and possibly also the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]], [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]] languages.&lt;ref name=georg1999&gt;Stefan Georg, Peter A. Michalove, Alexis Manaster Ramer, and Paul J. Sidwell (1999): &quot;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=A7D36A55C4A29AEB34AA39715F46F706.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=17033 Telling general linguists about Altaic]&quot;. ''Journal of Linguistics'', volume 35, issue 1, pages 65–98.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}} Speakers of those languages are currently scattered over most of [[Asia]] north of 35 °N and in some eastern parts of [[Europe]], extending in longitude from [[Turkey]] to [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/maps/maps23.php?lan=en|title=Interactive Maps The Altaic Family from The Tower of Babel|publisher=Starling.rinet.ru|date=|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is named after the [[Altai Mountains|Altai mountain range]] in the center of Asia. Most [[Comparative linguistics|comparative linguists]] today reject the hypothesis, but it still has supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;georg1999&quot;/&gt;

The Altaic family was first proposed in the 18th century. It was widely accepted until the 1960s, and is still listed in many encyclopedias and handbooks.&lt;ref name=georg1999/&gt; Since the 1950s, many comparative linguists have rejected the proposal, after supposed [[cognate]]s were found not to be valid, and Turkic and Mongolic languages were found to be converging rather than diverging over the centuries. Opponents of the theory proposed that the similarities are due to [[language contact|mutual linguistic influences]] between the groups concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Campbell and Mauricio J. Mixco (2007): ''A Glossary of Historical Linguistics''; University of Utah Press. Page 7: &quot;While 'Altaic' is repeated in encyclopedias and handbooks most specialists in these languages no longer believe that the three traditional supposed Altaic groups, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic, are related.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols (1992) ''Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time''. Chicago University Press. Page 4: &quot;When cognates proved not to be valid, Altaic was abandoned, and the received view now is that Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic are unrelated.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. M. W. Dixon (1997): ''The Rise and Fall of Languages''. Cambridge University Press. Page 32: &quot;Careful examination indicates that the established families, Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic, form a linguistic area (called Altaic)...Sufficient criteria have not been given that would justify talking of a genetic relationship here.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=perel2012&gt;Asya Pereltsvaig (2012) ''Languages of the World, An Introduction''. Cambridge University Press. Pages 211–216: &quot;[...T]his selection of features does not provide good evidence for common descent&quot; [...] &quot;we can observe convergence rather than divergence between Turkic and Mongolic languages—a pattern than is easily explainable by borrowing and diffusion rather than common descent&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The original hypothesis unified only the Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic groups. Later proposals to include the Korean and Japanese languages into a &quot;Macro-Altaic&quot; family have always been controversial. (The original proposal was sometimes called &quot;Micro-Altaic&quot; by [[retronym]]y.) Most proponents of Altaic continue to support the inclusion of Korean.&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2008&quot;&gt;Roger Blench and Mallam Dendo (2008): &quot;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b96/c6177913c04c7972abe56fcd86a9b6294686.pdf Stratification in the peopling of China: how far does the linguistic evidence match genetics and archaeology?]&quot; In Alicia Sanchez-Mazas et al., eds. ''Human migrations in continental East Asia and Taiwan: genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence'', chapter 4. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; A common ancestral [[Proto-Altaic language]] for the &quot;Macro&quot; family has been tentatively reconstructed by [[Sergei Starostin]] and others.&lt;ref name=staro2003/&gt;

Micro-Altaic includes about 66 living languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=7-16|title=Browse by Language Family|date=|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Macro-Altaic would add Korean, [[Jeju language|Jeju]], Japanese and the [[Ryukyuan languages]], for a total of 74 (depending on what is considered a language and what is considered a [[Language or dialect|dialect]]). These numbers do not include earlier states of languages, such as [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]], [[Old Korean]] or [[Old Japanese]].

==Earliest attestations of the languages==
The earliest known texts in a Turkic language are the [[Orkhon inscriptions]], 720–735 AD.&lt;ref name=miller71/&gt;{{rp|3}} They were deciphered in 1893 by the Danish linguist [[Vilhelm Thomsen]] in a scholarly race with his rival, the German–Russian linguist [[Vasily Radlov|Wilhelm Radloff]]. However, Radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions.

The first Tungusic language to be attested is [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]], the language of the ancestors of the [[Qing dynasty|Manchus]]. A writing system for it was devised in 1119 AD and an inscription using this system is known from 1185 (see [[List of Jurchen inscriptions]]).

The earliest [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language of which we have written evidence is known as [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]]. It is first attested by an inscription dated to 1224 or 1225 AD, the [[Stele of Yisüngge]], and by the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]'', written in 1228 (see [[Mongolic languages]]). The earliest Para-Mongolic text is the [[Memorial for Yelü Yanning]], written in the [[Khitan large script]] and dated to 986 AD. However, the [[Inscription of Hüis Tolgoi]], discovered in 1975 and analysed as being in an early form of Mongolic, has been dated to 604-620 AD. The [[Bugut inscription]] dates back to 584 AD.

Japanese is first attested in the form of names contained in a few short inscriptions in [[Classical Chinese]] from the 5th century AD, such as found on the [[Inariyama Sword]]. The first substantial text in Japanese, however, is the [[Kojiki]], which dates from 712 AD. It is followed by the [[Nihon Shoki|Nihon shoki]], completed in 720, and that by the [[Man'yōshū]], which dates from [[circa|c.]] 771–785, but includes material that is from about 400 years earlier.&lt;ref name=miller71/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The most important text for the study of early Korean is the [[Hyangga]], a collection of 25 poems, of which some go back to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period (57 BC–668 AD), but are preserved in an [[orthography]] that only goes back to the 9th century AD.&lt;ref name=miller96/&gt;{{rp|60}} Korean is copiously attested from the mid-15th century on in the phonetically precise [[Hangul]] system of writing.&lt;ref name=miller96/&gt;{{rp|61}}

==History of the Altaic family concept==
[[File:2006-07 altaj belucha.jpg|thumb|The Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia give their name to the proposed language family.]]

===Origins===
A proposed grouping of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was published in 1730 by [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]], a Swedish officer who traveled in the eastern [[Russian Empire]] while a prisoner of war after the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name=poppe65&gt;Nicholas Poppe (1965): ''Introduction to Altaic Linguistics.'' Volume 14 of ''Ural-altaische Bibliothek''. Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page 125}} However, he may not have intended to imply a closer relationship among those languages.&lt;ref name=ramer&gt;[[Alexis Manaster Ramer]] and [[Paul Sidwell]] (1997): &quot;The truth about Strahlenberg's classification of the languages of Northeastern Eurasia.&quot; ''Journal de la Société finno-ougrienne'', volume 87, pages 139–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uralo-Altaic hypothesis===
In 1844, the Finnish [[Philology|philologist]] [[Matthias Castrén]] proposed a broader grouping, that later came to be called the [[Ural–Altaic languages|Ural–Altaic family]], which included Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (=Tungusic) as an &quot;Altaic&quot; branch, and also the [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] and [[Samoyedic languages]] as the &quot;Uralic&quot; branch (though Castrén himself used the terms &quot;Tataric&quot; and &quot;Chudic&quot;).&lt;ref name=poppe65/&gt;{{rp|126–127}} The name &quot;Altaic&quot; referred to the [[Altai Mountains]] in East-Central Asia, which are approximately the center of the geographic range of the three main families. The name &quot;Uralic&quot; referred to the [[Ural Mountains]].

While the Ural-Altaic family hypothesis can still be found in some encyclopedias, atlases, and similar general references, after the 1960s it has been heavily criticized. Even linguists who accept the basic Altaic family, like [[Sergei Starostin]], completely discard the inclusion of the &quot;Uralic&quot; branch.&lt;ref name=staro2003/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

===Korean and Japanese languages===
In 1857, the Austrian scholar [[Anton Boller]] suggested adding [[Japanese language|Japanese]] to the Ural–Altaic family.&lt;ref name=miller86&gt;Roy Andrew Miller (1986): ''Nihongo: In Defence of Japanese.'' {{ISBN|0-485-11251-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

In the 1920s, [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G.J. Ramstedt]] and [[Yevgeny Polivanov|E.D. Polivanov]] advocated the inclusion of Korean. Decades later, in his 1952 book, Ramstedt rejected the Ural–Altaic hypothesis but again included Korean in Altaic, an inclusion followed by most leading Altaicists (supporters of the theory) to date.&lt;!--Which date?--&gt;&lt;ref name=rams&gt;Gustaf John Ramstedt (1952): ''Einführung in die altaische Sprachwissenschaft'' (&quot;Introduction to Altaic Linguistics&quot;). Volume I, ''Lautlehre'' (&quot;Phonology&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; His book contained the first comprehensive attempt to identify regular correspondences among the sound systems within the Altaic language families.

In 1960, Nicholas Poppe published what was in effect a heavily revised version of Ramstedt's volume on phonology&lt;ref name=poppe60&gt;Nicholas Poppe (1960): ''Vergleichende Grammatik der altaischen Sprachen. Teil I. Vergleichende Lautlehre'', ('Comparative Grammar of the Altaic Languages, Part 1: Comparative Phonology'). Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz. (Only part to appear of a projected larger work.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Andrew Miller (1991): &quot;Genetic connections among the Altaic languages.&quot; In Sydney M. Lamb and E. Douglas Mitchell (editors), ''Sprung from Some Common Source: Investigations into the Prehistory of Languages'', 1991, 293–327. {{ISBN|0-8047-1897-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that has since set the standard in Altaic studies. Poppe considered the issue of the relationship of Korean to Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic not settled.&lt;ref name=poppe65/&gt;{{rp|148}} In his view, there were three possibilities: (1) Korean did not belong with the other three genealogically, but had been influenced by an Altaic substratum; (2) Korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other; (3) Korean had split off from the other three before they underwent a series of characteristic changes.

[[Roy Andrew Miller]]'s 1971 book ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages'' convinced most Altaicists that Japanese also belonged to Altaic.&lt;ref name=poppe76&gt;Nicholas Poppe (1976): &quot;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/132066 Review of Karl H. Menges, ''Altajische Studien II. Japanisch und Altajisch'' (1975)]&quot;. In ''The Journal of Japanese Studies'', volume 2, issue 2, pages 470–474.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller71&gt;Roy Andrew Miller (1971): ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages.'' University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-52719-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the &quot;Macro-Altaic&quot; has been generally assumed to include Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese.

In 1990, Unger advocated a family consisting of Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic languages, but not Turkic or Mongolic.&lt;ref name=unger90&gt;J. Marshall Unger (1990): &quot;Summary report of the Altaic panel.&quot; In [[Philip Baldi]], ed., ''Linguistic Change and Reconstruction Methodology'', pages 479–482. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many linguists dispute the alleged affinities of Korean and Japanese to the other three groups. Some authors instead tried to connect Japanese to the [[Austronesian languages]].&lt;ref name=staro2003/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

In 2017 [[Martine Robbeets]] proposed that Japanese (and possibly Korean) originated as a [[creole language|hybrid language]]. She proposed that the [[urheimat|ancestral home]] of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was somewhere in northwestern [[Manchuria]]. A group of those proto-Altaic (&quot;Transeurasian&quot;) speakers would have migrated south into the modern [[Liaoning]] province, where they would have been mostly assimilated by an agricultural community with an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]-like language. The fusion of the two languages would have resulted in proto-Japanese and proto-Korean.&lt;ref name=robbe&gt;Martine Irma Robbeets (2017): &quot;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320915864_Austronesian_influence_and_Transeurasian_ancestry_in_Japanese_A_case_of_farminglanguage_dispersal Austronesian influence and Transeurasian ancestry in Japanese: A case of farming/language dispersal]&quot;. ''Language Dynamics and Change'', volume 7, issue 2, pages 201–251, {{doi|10.1163/22105832-00702005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=robb2015&gt;Martine Irma Robbeets (2015): ''Diachrony of verb morphology – Japanese and the Transeurasian languages''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ainu language===
In 1962 John C. Street proposed an alternative classification, with Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic in one grouping and Korean-Japanese-[[Ainu language|Ainu]] in another, joined in what he designated as the &quot;North Asiatic&quot; family.&lt;ref name=street&gt;John C. Street (1962): &quot;Review of N. Poppe, ''Vergleichende Grammatik der altaischen Sprachen, Teil I'' (1960)&quot;. ''Language'', volume 38, pages 92–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of Ainu was adopted also by [[James Patrie]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=patrie78&gt;James Tyrone Patrie (1978): ''The genetic relationship of the Ainu language''. Ph. D. thesis, University of Hawaii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patrie82&gt;James Tyrone Patrie (1982): ''The Genetic Relationship of the Ainu Language.'' University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-0724-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic and Korean-Japanese-Ainu groupings were also posited in 2000–2002 by [[Joseph Greenberg]]. However, he treated them as independent members of a larger family, which he termed [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]].&lt;ref name=grenberg2000&gt;Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002): ''Indo-European and Its Closest Relatives: The Eurasiatic Language Family'', 2 volumes. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of Ainu is not widely accepted by Altaicists.&lt;ref name=georg1999/&gt; In fact, no convincing genealogical relationship between Ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated, and it is generally regarded as a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dougherty |first=Thomas |year=2018 |chapter=Ainu |editor-last=Campbell |editor-first=Lyle |editorlink=Lyle Campbell |title=Language Isolates |series=Routledge Language Family Series |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=100–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Controversy&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;The controversy over Altaic&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;

===Early criticism and rejection===
Starting in the late 1950s, some linguists became increasingly critical of even the minimal Altaic family hypothesis, disputing the alleged evidence of genetic connection between Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages.

Among the earlier critics were [[Gerard Clauson]] (1956), [[Gerhard Doerfer]] (1963), and [[Alexander Shcherbak]]. They claimed that the words and features shared by Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances.&lt;ref name=clauson56/&gt;&lt;ref name=doerfer63/&gt;&lt;ref name=shche63/&gt; In 1988, Doerfer again rejected all the genetic claims over these major groups.&lt;ref name=doerfer88&gt;Gerhard Doerfer (1988): ''Grundwort und Sprachmischung: Eine Untersuchung an Hand von Körperteilbezeichnungen.'' Franz Steiner. Wiesbaden:&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern controversy===
A major continuing supporter of the Altaic hypothesis has been S. Starostin, who published a comparative lexical analysis of the Altaic languages in (1991). He concluded that the analysis supported the Altaic grouping, although it was &quot;older than most other language families in Eurasia, such as Indo-European or Finno-Ugric, and this is the reason why the modern Altaic languages preserve few common elements&quot;.&lt;ref name=staro91/&gt;

In 1991 and again in 1996, Roy Miller defended the Altaic hypothesis and claimed that the criticisms of Clauson and Doerfer apply exclusively to the lexical correspondences, whereas the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in verbal morphology.&lt;ref name=miller91&gt;Roy Andrew Miller (1991), page page 298&lt;!--Bibliographic data needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller96&gt;Roy Andrew Miller (1996): ''Languages and History: Japanese, Korean and Altaic.'' Oslo: Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture. {{ISBN|974-8299-69-4}}. Pages 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Claus Schönig published a critical overview of the history of the Altaic hypothesis up to that time, siding with the earlier criticisms of Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak.&lt;ref name=schon03/&gt;

In 2003, Starostin, [[Anna Dybo]] and Oleg Mudrak published the ''[[Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages]]'', which expanded the 1991 lexical lists and added other phonological and grammatical arguments.&lt;ref name=staro2003/&gt;

Starostin's book was criticized by Stefan Georg in 2004 and 2005,&lt;ref name=georg2004&gt;Stefan Georg (2004): &quot;[Review of ''Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'' (2003)]&quot;.

''Diachronica'' volume 22, issue 2, pages 455–457.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Alexander Vovin in 2005.&lt;ref name=vovin2005&gt;Alexander Vovin (2005): &quot;The end of the Altaic controversy&quot; [review of Starostin et al. (2003)]. ''Central Asiatic Journal'' volume 49, issue 1, pages 71–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other defenses of the theory, in response to the criticisms of Georg and Vovin, were published by Starostin in 2005,&lt;ref name=staro2005&gt;Sergei A. Starostin (2005): &quot;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/dia/2005/00000022/00000002/art00008?token=00541ba51aae7dd8d6c573d257025255c232b465340514d3874747c4e7547543c7e386f642f466fad2e3 Response to Stefan Georg's review of the ''Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'']&quot;.

RSUH Publishers, Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Lars Johanson]] echoed Miller's 1996 rebuttal to the critics, and called for a muting of the polemic.&lt;ref name=johans2010&gt;Lars Johanson (2010): &quot;The high and low spirits of Transeurasian language studies&quot; in Johanson and Robbeets, eds.

==Arguments==

===For the Altaic grouping===

====Phonological and grammatical features====
The original arguments for grouping the &quot;micro-Altaic&quot; languages within a Uralo-Altaic family were based on such shared features as [[vowel harmony]] and [[agglutinative language|agglutination]].

According to Roy Miller, the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in [[verb]]al [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=miller96/&gt;

The ''Etymological Dictionary'' by Starostin and others (2003) proposes a set of sound change laws that would explain the evolution from Proto-Altaic to the descendant languages. For example, although most of today's Altaic languages have vowel harmony, Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by them lacked it; instead, various vowel assimilations between the first and second syllables of words occurred in Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic. They also included a number of grammatical correspondences between the languages.&lt;ref name=staro2003/&gt;

====Shared lexicon====
Starostin claimed in 1991 that the members of the proposed Altaic group shared about 15–20% of apparent cognates within a 110-word [[Swadesh list#Shorter lists|Swadesh-Yakhontov list]]; in particular, Turkic–Mongolic 20%, Turkic–Tungusic 18%, Turkic–Korean 17%, Mongolic–Tungusic 22%, Mongolic–Korean 16%, and Tungusic–Korean 21%.&lt;ref name=staro91&gt;Sergei A. Starostin (1991): ''Altajskaja problema i proisxoždenie japonskogo jazyka'' ('The Altaic Problem and the Origin of the Japanese Language'). Nauka, Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 ''Etymological Dictionary'' includes a list of 2,800 proposed [[cognate]] sets, as well as a few important changes to the reconstruction of Proto-Altaic. The authors tried hard to distinguish loans between Turkic and Mongolic and between Mongolic and Tungusic from cognates; and suggest words that occur in Turkic and Tungusic but not in Mongolic. All other combinations between the five branches also occur in the book. It lists 144 items of shared basic vocabulary, including words for such items as 'eye', 'ear', 'neck', 'bone', 'blood', 'water', 'stone', 'sun', and 'two'.&lt;ref name=staro2003&gt;Sergei Starostin, Anna V. Dybo, and Oleg A. Mudrak (2003): ''[[Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages]]'', 3 volumes. {{ISBN|90-04-13153-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the grouping===

====Weakness of lexical and typological data====
According to G. Clauson (1956), G. Doerfer (1963), and A. Shcherbak (1963), many of the [[linguistic typology|typological]] features of the supposed Altaic languages, such as [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) word order, usually occur together in languages.&lt;ref name=clauson56/&gt;&lt;ref name=doerfer63/&gt;&lt;ref name=shche63/&gt;

Those critics also argued that the words and features shared by Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances. They noted that there was little vocabulary shared by Turkic and Tungusic languages, though more shared with Mongolic languages. They reasoned that, if all three families had a common ancestor, we should expect losses to happen at random, and not only at the geographical margins of the family; and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing.&lt;ref name=clauson56/&gt;&lt;ref name=doerfer63/&gt;&lt;ref name=shche63/&gt;

According to C. Schönig (2003), after accounting for areal effects, the shared lexicon that could have a common genetic origin was reduced to a small number of monosyllabic lexical roots, including the personal pronouns and a few other deictic and auxiliary items, whose sharing could be explained in other ways; not the kind of sharing expected in cases of genetic relationship.&lt;ref name=schon03&gt;Schönig (2003): &quot;Turko-Mongolic Relations.&quot; In ''The Mongolic Languages'', edited by Juha Janhunen, pages 403–419. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Sprachbund hypothesis====
Instead of a common genetic origin, Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak proposed (in 1956-1966) that Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages form a ''[[Sprachbund]]'': a set of languages with similarities due to [[Language convergence|convergence]] through intensive borrowing and long contact, rather than common origin.&lt;ref name=clauson56&gt;Gerard Clauson (1956). &quot;[http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/CLAUSON/Clauson_against.pdf The case against the Altaic theory]&quot;. ''Central Asiatic Journal'' volume 2, pages 181–187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doerfer63&gt;Gerhard Doerfer (1963): &quot;Bemerkungen zur Verwandtschaft der sog. altaische Sprachen&quot; ('Remarks on the relationship of the so-called Altaic languages') In Gerhard Doerfer ed.: ''Türkische und mongolische Elemente im Neupersischen, Bd. I: Mongolische Elemente im Neupersischen'', pages 51–105. Franz Steiner, Wiesbaden&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shche63&gt;Alexander Shcherbak (1963).&lt;!--Bibliographic data needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Asya Pereltsvaig further observed in 2011 that, in general, [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]] languages and families tend to diverge over time: the earlier forms are more similar than modern forms. However, she claims that an analysis of the earliest written records of Mongolic and Turkic languages shows the opposite, suggesting that they do not share a common traceable ancestor, but rather have become more similar through language contact and areal effects.&lt;ref name=perel2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=perel2011&gt;Asya Pereltsvaig (2011): &quot;[http://www.languagesoftheworld.info/language-families/the-altaic-family-controversy.html The Altaic family controversy]&quot;. ''Languages Of The World'' website, published on 2011-02-16. Accessed on 2017-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis about the original homeland{{anchor|Postulated Urheimat}}==
{{see|Ural-Altaic}}
The prehistory of the peoples speaking the &quot;Altaic&quot; languages is largely unknown. Whereas for certain other language families, such as the speakers of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]], [[Proto-Uralic language|Uralic]], and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], it is possible to frame substantial hypotheses, in the case of the proposed Altaic family much remains to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1991), page 319–320&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[Urheimat]]:
In the absence of written records, there are several ways to study the (pre)history of a people:
*Identification of [[archaeological culture]]s: the material remains found at dwelling sites, burial grounds, and other places where people left traces of their activity.
*[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropology]], which studies the physical characteristics of peoples, ancient and modern.
*[[Genetics]], particularly the study of [[ancient DNA]]. 
*[[Philology]], which studies the evidence in language families for their primitive locations and the nature of their cultures. (For an example, see [[Proto-Uralic language#Vocabulary|Proto-Uralic language]].) Mythology and legend often contain important clues to the earlier history of peoples.
*[[Glottochronology]], which attempts to estimate the time depth of a language family based on an assumed rate of change in languages. Related to this is [[lexicostatistics]], which attempts to determine the degree of relation between a set of languages by comparing the percentage of basic vocabulary (words like &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;heart&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;and&quot;) they share in common.
*The development of a family tree of languages that notes the relative distance of the splits that occur in it.
*The observation of evidence for [[Language contact|contact between languages]], which may approximate when and where they were adjacent to each other.

All of these methods remain to be applied to the languages attributed to Altaic with the same degree of focus and intensity with which they have been applied to the Indo-European family (e.g. Mallory 1989, Anthony 2007).&lt;ref name=mall1989&gt;J. P. Mallory (1989) ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans.'' Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Some scholars have conjectured a possible Uralic and Altaic homeland in the [[Central Asian steppes]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikoloz Silagadze, ''&quot;[http://www.spekali.tsu.ge/index.php/en/article/viewArticle/2/16 The Homeland Problem of Indo-European Language-Speaking Peoples]&quot;'', 2010. Faculty of Humanities at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University. {{ISSN|1987-8583}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.N. Matyuishin (2003), pages 368–372.&lt;!--Bibliographic data needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Juha Janhunen]], the ancestral languages of Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese were spoken in a relatively small area comprising present-day North Korea, Southern Manchuria, and Southeastern Mongolia.&lt;ref name=johrob2010&gt;Lars Johanson and Martine Irma Robbeets (2010): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9zcxQqmkgE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Transeurasian Verbal Morphology in a Comparative Perspective: Genealogy, Contact, Chance.]''. Introduction to the book, pages 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; However Janhunen is sceptical about an affiliation of Japanese to Altaic,&lt;ref name=jahu1992&gt;Juha Janhunen (1992): &quot;Das Japanische in vergleichender Sicht&quot;. ''Journal de la Société finno-ougrienne'', volume 84, pages 145–161.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[András Róna-Tas]] remarked that a relationship between Altaic and Japanese, if it ever existed, must be more remote than the relationship of any two of the Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name=tas1988&gt;András Róna-Tas (1988).&lt;!--Bibliographic data needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Ramsey stated that &quot;the genetic relationship between Korean and Japanese, if it in fact exists, is probably more complex and distant than we can imagine on the basis of our present state of knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;S. Robert Ramsey (2004): &quot;Accent, Liquids, and the Search for a Common Origin for Korean and Japanese&quot;. ''Japanese Language and Literature'', volume 38, issue 2, page 340. American Association of Teachers of Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the Altaic hypothesis formerly set the date of the Proto-Altaic language at around 4000 BC, but today at around 5000 BC&lt;ref name=staro2003/&gt; or 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Elena E. Kuz'mina (2007): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=x5J9rn8p2-IC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Origin of the Indo-Iranians]'', page 364. Brill. {{ISBN|978-9004160-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would make Altaic a language family about as old as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (4000 to 7,000 BC according to several hypotheses&lt;ref&gt;Mallory (1997): Page 106&lt;/ref&gt;) but considerably younger than [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] (c. 10,000 BC&lt;ref&gt;Igor M. Diakonoff (1988): ''Afrasian Languages.'' Nauka, Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} or 11,000 to 16,000 BC&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002)&lt;!--Bibliographic data needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35–36}} according to different sources).
