== Early life ==

Her father, Sergei Kournikov (born 1961),&lt;ref name=&quot;community.kournikova.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.kournikova.com/showthread.php?t=32375 |title=Anna's official discussion forum |publisher=Community.kournikova.com |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] champion, eventually earned a PhD and was a professor at the University of Physical Culture and Sport in Moscow. As of 2001, he was still a part-time martial arts instructor there. Her mother Alla (born 1963) had been a [[400 metres|400-metre runner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt; Her younger half-brother, [[Allan Kournikova|Allan]], is a youth golf world champion who was featured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[The Short Game]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/anna-kournikova-little-brother-allan-blossoming-golf-champion|title=Anna Kournikova's Little Brother is a Blossoming Golf Champion|author=Holmes, John|website=PGA.com|publisher=[[Professional Golfers Association]]|accessdate=22 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619160742/http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/anna-kournikova-little-brother-allan-blossoming-golf-champion|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kournikova received her first tennis [[racquet]] as a New Year gift in 1986 at the age of five. Describing her early regimen, she said, &quot;I played two times a week from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I was going to play professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd spend the rest of the day there just having fun with the kids.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Anna Kournikova: Description|url=http://www.sportsmates.com/index.php?cmd=view_gallery&amp;gal_id=380&amp;image_id=5975&amp;page=1&amp;club_id=2461|website=Sportsmates|accessdate=10 March 2012|url-status=usurped|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206065346/http://www.sportsmates.com/index.php?cmd=view_gallery&amp;gal_id=380&amp;image_id=5975&amp;page=1&amp;club_id=2461|archivedate=6 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the [[Spartak Tennis Club]], coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;kournikova.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About Me: Biography|url=http://www.kournikova.com/about/bio|website=Kournikova.com - The Official Website of Anna Kournikova|accessdate=10 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323181546/http://www.kournikova.com/about/bio|archive-date=23 March 2012}} Original redirects to Facebook.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world.

In 2003, Anna Kournikova collected her first Grand Slam match victory in two years at the [[2003 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. She defeated [[Henrieta Nagyová]] in the first round, and then lost to [[Justine Henin-Hardenne]] in the 2nd round. She withdrew from Tokyo due to a sprained back suffered at the Australian Open and did not return to Tour until Miami. On 9 April, in what would be the final WTA match of her career, Kournikova dropped out in the first round of the [[Family Circle Cup]] in Charleston, due to a left adductor strain. Her singles world ranking was 67. She reached the semi-finals at the ITF tournament in [[Sea Island, Georgia|Sea Island]], before withdrawing from a match versus [[Maria Sharapova]] due to the adductor injury. She lost in the first round of the ITF tournament in Charlottesville. She did not compete for the rest of the season due to a continuing back injury. At the end of the 2003 season and her professional career, she was ranked No. 305 in singles and No. 176 in doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Website - Tennis Stats&quot;/&gt;

Kournikova's two Grand Slam doubles titles came in 1999 and 2002, both at the Australian Open in the Women's Doubles event with partner Martina Hingis. Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the US Open and at Wimbledon, and reaching the No. 1 ranking in doubles in the WTA Tour rankings. Her pro career doubles record was 200–71. However, her singles career plateaued after 1999. For the most part, she managed to retain her ranking between 10 and 15 (her career high singles ranking was No.8), but her expected finals breakthrough failed to occur; she only reached four finals out of 130 singles tournaments, never in a Grand Slam event, and never won one.

Her singles record is 209–129. Her final playing years were marred by a string of injuries, especially back injuries, which caused her ranking to erode gradually. As a personality Kournikova was among the most common search strings for both articles and images in her prime.&lt;ref name=2001EOY/&gt;&lt;ref name=2002EOY/&gt;&lt;ref name=2003EOY/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Kournikova was in a relationship with fellow Russian, [[Pavel Bure]], an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[ice hockey]] player. The two met in 1999, when Kournikova was still linked to Bure's former Russian teammate [[Sergei Fedorov]].&lt;ref name=arbat&gt;{{cite news |title=People: Courtney Love, Scissor Sisters, Antonio Moral |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/arts/11iht-peepsat.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |date=11 February 2005 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after a reporter took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kournikova and Bure wedding may be off |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/kournikova-and-bure-wedding-may-be-off-720494.html |accessdate=24 June 2009 |date=6 April 2000 |work=The Independent |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;
