'''Argon''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&amp;nbsp;'''Ar''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;18. It is in group 18 of the [[periodic table]] and is a [[noble gas]].&lt;ref&gt;In older versions of the periodic table, the noble gases were identified as Group VIIIA or as Group 0. See [[Group (periodic table)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], at 0.934% (9340 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]]). It is more than twice as abundant as [[water vapor]] (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as [[carbon dioxide]] (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as [[neon]] (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.

Nearly all of the argon in the Earth's atmosphere is [[radiogenic]] [[argon-40]], derived from the [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of [[potassium-40]] in the Earth's crust. In the universe, [[argon-36]] is by far the most common argon [[isotope]], as it is the most easily produced by stellar [[nucleosynthesis]] in [[supernova]]s.

The name &quot;argon&quot; is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἀργόν}}, neuter singular form of {{lang|grc|ἀργός}} meaning &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;, as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete [[octet rule|octet]] (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its [[triple point]] temperature of 83.8058&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] is a defining fixed point in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]].

Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]]. Argon is mostly used as an [[Inert gas|inert]] [[shielding gas]] in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in [[graphite]] electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]], [[fluorescent lighting]], and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive [[Ion laser#Argon laser|blue-green gas laser]]. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.

Argon has approximately the same [[solubility]] in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than [[nitrogen]]. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uigi.com/MSDS_gaseous_Ar.html Material Safety Data Sheet Gaseous Argon], Universal Industrial Gases, Inc. Retrieved 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Argon is chemically [[Inert gas|inert]] under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.

Although argon is a [[noble gas]], it can form some compounds under various extreme conditions. [[Argon fluorohydride]] (HArF), a compound of argon with [[fluorine]] and [[hydrogen]] that is stable below {{cvt|17|K}}, has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first accomplished this by replicating an experiment of [[Henry Cavendish]]'s. They trapped a mixture of atmospheric air with additional oxygen in a test-tube (A) upside-down over a large quantity of dilute [[alkali]] solution (B), which in Canvendish's original experiment was potassium hydroxide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cave1785&quot; /&gt; and conveyed a current through wires insulated by U-shaped glass tubes (CC) which sealed around the platinum wire electrodes, leaving the ends of the wires (DD) exposed to the gas and insulated from the alkali solution. The arc was powered by a battery of five [[Grove cell]]s and a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] of medium size. The alkali absorbed the oxides of nitrogen produced by the arc and also carbon dioxide. They operated the arc until no more reduction of volume of the gas could be seen for at least an hour or two and the spectral lines of nitrogen disappeared when the gas was examined. The remaining oxygen was reacted with alkaline pyrogallate to leave behind an apparently non-reactive gas which they called Argon.

Before isolating the gas, they had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was 0.5% lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere. The difference was slight, but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months. They concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of argon}}

The main [[isotope]]s of argon found on Earth are {{chem|40|Ar}} (99.6%), {{chem|36|Ar}} (0.34%), and {{chem|38|Ar}} (0.06%). Naturally occurring {{chem|40|[[potassium|K]]}}, with a [[half-life]] of 1.25{{e|9}} years, decays to stable {{chem|40|Ar}} (11.2%) by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]], and also to stable {{chem|40|Ca}} (88.8%) by [[beta decay]]. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] by [[K–Ar dating]].&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref name=iso&gt;

In the Earth's atmosphere, {{chem|39|Ar}} is made by [[cosmic ray]] activity, primarily by neutron capture of {{chem|40|Ar}} followed by two-neutron emission. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through [[neutron capture]] by {{chem|39|K}}, followed by proton emission. {{chem|37|Ar}} is created from the [[neutron capture]] by {{chem|40|Ca}} followed by an [[alpha particle]] emission as a result of subsurface [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosions]]. It has a half-life of 35 days.&lt;ref name=iso/&gt;

Between locations in the [[Solar System]], the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly. Where the major source of argon is the decay of [[potassium-40|{{chem|40|K}}]] in rocks, {{chem|40|Ar}} will be the dominant isotope, as it is on Earth. Argon produced directly by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], is dominated by the [[alpha process|alpha-process]] nuclide {{chem|36|Ar}}. Correspondingly, solar argon contains 84.6% {{chem|36|Ar}} (according to [[solar wind]] measurements),&lt;ref&gt;

The predominance of [[radiogenic]] {{chem|40|Ar}} is the reason the [[standard atomic weight]] of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element, [[potassium]], a fact that was puzzling when argon was discovered. [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] positioned the elements on his [[periodic table]] in order of atomic weight, but the inertness of argon suggested a placement ''before'' the reactive [[alkali metal]]. [[Henry Moseley]] later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of [[atomic number]] (see [[History of the periodic table]]).

Argon's complete octet of [[electron]]s indicates full s and p subshells. This full [[valence shell]] makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements. Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds; however, compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized. The first argon compound with tungsten pentacarbonyl, W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Ar, was isolated in 1975. However it was not widely recognised at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Nigel A.|title=Main group coordination chemistry at low temperatures: A review of matrix isolated Group 12 to Group 18 complexes|journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews|date=March 2013|volume=257|issue=5–6|pages=956–1010|doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2012.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2000, another argon compound, [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF), was formed by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]], by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of [[hydrogen fluoride]] with [[caesium iodide]].

==Production==
===Industrial===
Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]] in a [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]] unit; a process that separates [[liquid nitrogen]], which boils at 77.3&amp;nbsp;K, from argon, which boils at 87.3&amp;nbsp;K, and [[liquid oxygen]], which boils at 90.2&amp;nbsp;K. About 700,000 [[tonne]]s of argon are produced worldwide every year.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Isotopes of argon|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar]], the most abundant [[isotope]] of argon, is produced by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;[[potassium|K]] with a half-life of 1.25{{e|9}} years by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]]. Because of this, it is used in [[potassium–argon dating]] to determine the age of rocks.

==Applications==
[[Image:Argon.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Cylinders containing argon gas for use in extinguishing fire without damaging server equipment]]

Argon has several desirable properties:
* Argon is a chemically [[inert gas]].
* Argon is the cheapest alternative when [[nitrogen]] is not sufficiently inert.
* Argon has low [[thermal conductivity]].
* Argon has electronic properties (ionization and/or the emission spectrum) desirable for some applications.

Other [[noble gas]]es would be equally suitable for most of these applications, but argon is by far the cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]] in the production of [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid nitrogen]]: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except [[helium]]) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.

===Industrial processes===
Argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.

For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of [[arc welding]] such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[gas tungsten arc welding]], as well as in the processing of [[titanium]] and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]].

Argon is used in the poultry industry to [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiate]] birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the [[electric bath]]. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during [[inert gas asphyxiation|gassing]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
Liquid argon is used as the target for neutrino experiments and direct [[dark matter]] searches. The interaction between the hypothetical [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]]s and an argon nucleus produces [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light that is detected by [[photomultiplier tubes]]. Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV&lt;ref&gt;

Compared to [[xenon]], argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to {{chem|39|Ar}} contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less {{chem|39|Ar}} contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth's atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived {{chem|40|K}} ({{chem|40|K}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|40|Ar}} + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth. The {{chem|39|Ar}} activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction {{chem|40|Ar}}(n,2n){{chem|39|Ar}} and similar reactions. The half-life of {{chem|39|Ar}} is only 269&amp;nbsp;years. As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less {{chem|39|Ar}} contamination.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include [[DarkSide]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WArP]], [[ArDM]], [[Cryogenic Low-Energy Astrophysics with Neon|microCLEAN]] and [[DEAP]]. Neutrino experiments include [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS]] and [[MicroBooNE]], both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a [[time projection chamber]] for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions.

===Preservative===
[[File:CsCrystals.JPG|thumb|A sample of [[caesium]] is packed under argon to avoid reactions with air]]
Argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the [[E numbers|European food additive code]] E938). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon.

In [[winemaking]], argon is used in a variety of activities to provide a barrier against oxygen at the liquid surface, which can spoil wine by fueling both microbial metabolism (as with [[acetic acid bacteria]]) and standard [[redox]] chemistry.

Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in [[aerosol]] cans for such products as [[varnish]], [[polyurethane]], and paint, and to displace air when preparing a container for storage after opening.&lt;ref&gt;Zawalick, Steven Scott &quot;Method for preserving an oxygen sensitive liquid product&quot; {{US patent|6629402}} Issue date: 7 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the American [[National Archives]] stores important national documents such as the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] within argon-filled cases to inhibit their degradation. Argon is preferable to the helium that had been used in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Glovebox.jpg|thumb|[[Glovebox]]es are often filled with argon, which recirculates over scrubbers to maintain an [[oxygen]]-, [[nitrogen]]-, and moisture-free atmosphere]]
{{See also|Air-free technique}}

Argon may be used as the [[inert gas]] within [[Schlenk line]]s and [[glovebox]]es. Argon is preferred to less expensive nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus.

Argon may be used as the carrier gas in [[gas chromatography]] and in [[electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]]; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in [[Inductively coupled plasma|ICP]] [[spectroscopy]]. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Argon gas is also commonly used for [[sputter deposition]] of thin films as in [[microelectronics]] and for [[microfabrication|wafer cleaning in microfabrication]].

===Medical use===
[[Cryosurgery]] procedures such as [[cryoablation]] use liquid argon to destroy tissue such as [[cancer]] cells. It is used in a procedure called &quot;argon-enhanced coagulation&quot;, a form of argon [[plasma torch|plasma beam]] [[electrosurgery]]. The procedure carries a risk of producing [[gas embolism]] and has resulted in the death of at least one patient.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Incandescent light]]s are filled with argon, to preserve the [[electrical filament|filaments]] at high temperature from oxidation. It is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in [[plasma globe]]s and [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimetry]] in experimental [[particle physics]]. [[Gas-discharge lamp]]s filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green [[argon laser|argon-ion lasers]].

Argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years, has been used for a number of applications, primarily [[ice core]] and [[ground water]] dating. Also, [[potassium–argon dating]] and related [[Argon argon dating|argon-argon dating]] is used to date [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], and [[igneous rock]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;emsley&quot; /&gt;

Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent to simulate [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions. In 2014, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) added argon and [[xenon]] to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although at this time there is no reliable test for abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WADA amends Section S.2.1 of 2014 Prohibited List |url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/2014-05/wada-amends-section-s21-of-2014-prohibited-list#.VARJ3WNqOIl |date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% more [[density|dense]] than air and therefore considered a dangerous [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] in closed areas. It is difficult to detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was [[asphyxia]]ted after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in [[Alaska]], highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.&lt;ref&gt;
