'''Anacondas''' or '''water boas''' are a group of large [[snake]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Eunectes]]''. They are found in tropical [[South America]]. Four [[species]] are currently recognized.

==Description==
Although the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species, in particular, the common or [[green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest.

==Etymology==
The South American names ''anacauchoa'' and ''anacaona'' were suggested in an account by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by [[Henry Walter Bates]] who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) that [[John Ray]] described in Latin in his ''Synopsis Methodica Animalium'' (1693) as ''serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus, ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/synopsismethodic00rayj#page/332/mode/1up |page=332 |year=1693 |author=Ray, John |title=Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis |publisher=Impensis S. Smith &amp; B. Walford |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray used a catalogue of snakes from the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie|Leyden museum]] supplied by Dr. [[Tancred Robinson]], but the description of its habit was based on [[Andreas Cleyer]] who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling around their bodies and crushing their bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Owen |year=1742| title=An essay towards a natural history of serpents |page=114|url=https://archive.org/stream/essaytowardsnat00owen#page/114/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Yule]] in his [[Hobson-Jobson]] notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the Scots Magazine by a certain R. Edwin. Edwin described a '[[tiger]]' being crushed to death by an anaconda, when there actually never were any tigers in Sri Lanka.{{efn|In [[South Asia]]n languages like Hindi, the [[leopard]] and [[tiger]] may share the same name, that is ''Bágh'' ({{lang-hi|बाघ}}), and it is the former that occurs in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pocock1930&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pocock, R.

The name commonly used for the anaconda in Brazil is ''sucuri'', ''sucuriju'' or ''sucuriuba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dicionário online de português: sucuriju|url=http://www.dicio.com.br/sucuriju/|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Anaconda Redpath museum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.5|Skeleton at the [[Redpath Museum]]]]
