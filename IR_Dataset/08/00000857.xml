'''Aberdeenshire''' ({{lang-sco|Aiberdeenshire}}; {{lang-gd|Siorrachd Obar Dheathain}}) is one of the 32 [[Subdivisions of Scotland#council areas of Scotland|council areas of Scotland]].

It takes its name from the [[County of Aberdeen]] which has substantially different boundaries. The Aberdeenshire council area includes all of the area of the [[Counties of Scotland|historic counties]] of Aberdeenshire and [[Kincardineshire]] (except the area making up the [[City of Aberdeen]]), as well as part of [[Banffshire]]. The county boundaries are officially used for a few purposes, namely land registration and [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ros.gov.uk/pdfs/map.pdf Land Register Counties &amp; Operational Dates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928060517/http://www.ros.gov.uk/pdfs/map.pdf |date=28 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in [[Aberdeen]], making it the only Scottish council whose headquarters are located outside its jurisdiction. Aberdeen itself forms a different council area (Aberdeen City). Aberdeenshire borders onto [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]] to the south, [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] and [[Moray]] to the west and Aberdeen City to the east.

Traditionally, it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and forestry) and related processing industries. Over the last 40 years, the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire's economic base, and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50% since 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Profile 2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223911/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its land represents 8% of Scotland's overall territory. It covers an area of {{convert|6313|sqkm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aberdeenshire profile |url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile201320813.pdf |publisher=Aberdeenshire Council |accessdate=9 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307210958/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile201320813.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|pages = 1301|encyclopedia= The Statesman's Yearbook 2014| editor-first= Barry|editor-last=Turner|year = 2013 | publisher = Macmillan Publishers Ltd.|isbn = 978-0-230-37769-1|title = Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Aberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage. It is the locus of a large number of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, including [[Longman Hill]], [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Catto Long Barrow]] and [[Cairn Lee]]. The area was settled in the [[Bronze Age]] by the [[Beaker culture]], who arrived from the south around 2000–1800 BC.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Stone circles and cairns were constructed predominantly in this era. In the [[Iron Age]], hill forts were built.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Around the 1st century AD, the [[Taexali]] people, who have left little history, were believed to have resided along the coast.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; The [[Picts]] were the next documented inhabitants of the area, and were no later than 800–900 AD. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] also were in the area during this period, as they left signs at [[Kintore, Aberdeenshire|Kintore]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Christianity influenced the inhabitants early on, and there were [[Celts|Celtic]] monasteries at [[Old Deer]] and [[Monymusk]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Since [[medieval]] times there have been a number of traditional paths that crossed the [[Mounth]] (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]) through present-day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. Some of the most well known and historically important [[trackway]]s are the [[Causey Mounth]] and [[Elsick Mounth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Douglas Simpson]], ''&quot;The Early Castles of Mar&quot;,'' Proceedings of the Society, 102, 10 December 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&amp;#39;Elsick Mounth'&amp;#39;, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |accessdate=6 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610071947/http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037| archivedate= 10 June 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeenshire played an important role in the fighting between the Scottish [[clan]]s. [[Clan MacBeth]] and the [[House of Dunkeld|Clan Canmore]] were two of the larger clans. Macbeth fell at [[Lumphanan]] in 1057.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; During the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] penetration, other families arrives such as [[House of Balliol]], [[Clan Bruce]], and [[Clan Cumming]] (Comyn).&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; When the fighting amongst these newcomers resulted in the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], the English king [[Edward I]] traveled across the area twice, in 1296 and 1303. In 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] was victorious near [[Inverurie]]. Along with his victory came new families, namely the [[Clan Forbes|Forbeses]] and the [[Clan Gordon|Gordons]].

These new families set the stage for the upcoming rivalries during the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; This rivalry grew worse during and after the Protestant Reformation, when religion was another reason for conflict between the clans. The Gordon family adhered to [[Catholicism]] and the [[Clan Forbes|Forbeses]] to [[Protestantism]]. Aberdeenshire was the historic seat of the [[Thomas Dempster#The fall of the clan|clan Dempster]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/William-Leslie-Ninth-Baron-of-Balquhain/6000000007193751531 Geni - William Leslie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/turriff.htm The New Statistical Account of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; Three universities were founded in the area prior to the 17th century, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in [[Old Aberdeen]] (1494), [[Marischal College]] in [[Aberdeen]] (1593), and the [[University of Fraserburgh]] (1597).&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

After the end of the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], an extended peaceful period was interrupted only by such fleeting events such as the [[Rising of 1715]] and the [[Rising of 1745]]. The latter resulted in the end of the ascendancy of [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalianism]] and the feudal power of landowners. An era began of increased agricultural and industrial progress.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; During the 17th century, Aberdeenshire was the location of more fighting, centered on the [[Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[English Civil War]]s.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; This period also saw increased wealth due to the increase in trade with [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The present council area is named after the [[Counties of Scotland|historic county]] of [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]], which has different boundaries and was abandoned as an administrative area in 1975 under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. It was replaced by [[Grampian Region|Grampian Regional Council]] and five district councils: [[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]], [[Kincardine and Deeside]], [[Moray]] and the [[City of Aberdeen]]. Local government functions were shared between the two levels. In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area. Moray and the City of Aberdeen were made their own council areas. The present Aberdeenshire council area consists of all of the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and [[Kincardineshire]] (except the area of those two counties making up the City of Aberdeen), as well as northeast portions of [[Banffshire]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Aberdeenshire |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/28 28–29] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The population of the council area has risen over 50% since 1971 to approximately {{Scottish council populations|POP=S12000034}},&lt;ref name=&quot;ONS&quot;&gt;{{United Kingdom district population citation|Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 4.7% of Scotland's total. Aberdeenshire's population has increased by 9.1% since 2001, while Scotland's total population grew by  3.8%.
The census lists a relatively high proportion of under 16s and slightly fewer people of working-age compared with the Scottish average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

Aberdeenshire is one of the most homogeneous regions of the UK. In 2011 82.2% of residents identified as 'White Scottish', followed by 12.3% who are 'White British', whilst ethnic minorities constitute only 0.9% of the population. The largest ethnic minority group are Asian Scottish/British at 0.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/media/11870/identityreportcensus2011.pdf|title=Aberdeenshire Council Identity in 2011 Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the English language, 48.8% of residents reported being able to speak and understand the Scots language &lt;ref&gt;https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/media/24618/inverurietownprofile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Economy==
Aberdeenshire's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at £3,496m (2011), representing 5.2% of the Scottish total. Aberdeenshire's economy is closely linked to Aberdeen City's (GDP £7,906m) and in 2011 the region as a whole was calculated to contribute 16.8% of Scotland's GDP. Between 2012 and 2014 the combined Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City economic forecast GDP growth rate is 8.6%, the highest growth rate of any local council area in the UK and above the Scottish rate of 4.8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

A significant proportion of Aberdeenshire's working residents commute to Aberdeen City for work, varying from 11.5% from Fraserburgh to 65% from Westhill.

Average Gross Weekly Earnings (for full-time employees employed in work places in Aberdeenshire in 2011) are £572.60. This is lower than the Scottish average by £2.10 and a fall of 2.6% on the 2010 figure. The average gross weekly pay of people resident in Aberdeenshire is much higher, at £741.90, as many people commute out
of Aberdeenshire, principally into Aberdeen City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

Total employment (excluding farm data) in Aberdeenshire is estimated at 93,700 employees (Business Register and
Employment Survey 2009). The majority of employees work within the service sector, predominantly in public administration, education and health. Almost 19% of employment is within the public sector. Aberdeenshire's economy remains closely linked to Aberdeen City's and the [[North Sea oil]] industry, with many employees in oil related jobs.

The average monthly unemployment (claimant count) rate for Aberdeenshire in 2011 was 1.5%. This is lower than the average rates for Aberdeen City (2.3%), Scotland (4.2%) and the UK (3.8%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;

==Major industries==
* '''Energy''' – There is significant energy related infrastructure, presence and expertise in Aberdeenshire. Peterhead is an important centre for the energy industry. Peterhead Port, which includes an extensive new quay with adjacent lay down area at Smith Quay, is a major support location for North Sea oil and gas exploration and production and the fast-growing global sub-sea sector. The Gas Terminal at St Fergus handles around 15% of the UK's natural gas requirements and the Peterhead power station is looking to host Britain's first carbon capture and storage power generation project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberdeenshire Profile 2012&quot; /&gt;
* '''Fishing''' – Aberdeenshire is Scotland's foremost fishing area. In 2010, catches landed at Aberdeenshire's ports accounted for over half the total fish landings of Scotland, and almost 45% in the UK. Peterhead and Fraserburgh ports, alongside Aberdeen City, provide much of the employment in these sectors.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;
* '''Agriculture''' – Aberdeenshire is rich in arable land, with an estimated 9,000 people employed in the sector, and is best known for rearing livestock. Sheep are important in the higher ground.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;
* '''Tourism''' – this sector continues to grow, with a range of sights to be seen in the area. From the lively Cairngorm Mountain range to the bustling fishing ports on the North-east coast, Aberdeenshire samples a bit of everything. Aberdeenshire also has a rugged coastline, many sandy beaches and is a hot spot for tourist activity throughout the year. Almost 1.3 million tourists visited the region in 2011 – up 3% on the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;AberdeenshireProfile2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Profile 2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223911/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/AberdeenshireProfile2012.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Whisky-distilling''' is still a practiced art in the area.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The Council's Revenue Budget for 2012/13 totals approx £548 million. The Education, Learning and Leisure Service takes the largest share of budget (52.3%), followed by Housing and Social Work (24.3%), Infrastructure Services (15.9%), Joint Boards (such as Fire and Police) and Misc services (7.9%) and Trading Activities (0.4%).

21.5% of the revenue is raised locally through the Council Tax. Average Band D Council Tax is £1,141 (2012/13), no change on the previous year.
The current chief executive of the Council is Jim Savege and the elected Council Leader is Jim Gifford. Aberdeenshire also has a Provost, who is Councillor Bill Howatson.

The council has devolved power to six [[area committee]]s: [[Banff and Buchan]]; [[Buchan]]; [[Formartine]]; [[Garioch]]; [[Marr]]; and [[Kincardine and Mearns]]. Each area committee takes decisions on local issues such as planning applications, and the split is meant to reflect the diverse circumstances of each area.
