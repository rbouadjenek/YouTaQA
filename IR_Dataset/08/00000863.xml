The '''American Civil War''' (also known by [[Names of the American Civil War|other names]]) was a [[civil war]] in the [[United States]] from 1861 to 1865, fought between the [[northern United States]] (loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]) and the [[southern United States]] (that had [[secession|seceded]] from the Union and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]).{{Efn|Although a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|Declaration of War]] was never issued by either the [[United States Congress]], nor the [[Congress of the Confederate States]], as their legal positions were such that it was unnecessary}} The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing [[Origins of the American Civil War|controversy]] over [[Slavery in the United States|the enslavement of black people]]. War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.

Of the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|&quot;slave states&quot;]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War. The two remaining &quot;slave states&quot;, Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].

The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years. Intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead, more than the number of U.S. military deaths in all other wars combined.{{Efn|At least until approximately the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Overview==
[[File:Flag of the United States (1863-1865).svg|thumb|Union flag]]
In the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], supported banning slavery in all the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]. The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' votes were distributed nationally and [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]'s votes centered in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, with an average of 49 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cwemancipation.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/slavery-and-secession-1860-census-statistics/ &quot;Date of Secession Related to 1860 Black Population&quot;], America's Civil War&lt;/ref&gt; Of those states whose legislatures resolved for secession, the first seven voted with split majorities for unionist candidates Douglas and Bell ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with 51% and [[Louisiana]] with 55%), or with sizable minorities for those unionists ([[Alabama]] with 46%, [[Mississippi]] with 40%, [[Florida]] with 38%, [[Texas]] with 25%, and [[South Carolina]], which cast [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes without a popular vote for president).&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Walter Dean. ''Presidential Ballots, 1836–1892''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1955, pp. 247–57&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only Texas held a referendum on secession.
[[File:Battle flag of the Confederate States of America.svg|160px|thumb|Confederate Army flag]]
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Outgoing Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|Lincoln's March 4, 1861, inaugural address]] declared that his administration would not initiate a [[civil war]]. Speaking directly to the &quot;Southern States&quot;, he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery, reaffirming, &quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gray White, Mia Bay, and Waldo E. Martin, Jr., ''Freedom on My Mind: A History of African Americans'' (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2013), 325.&lt;/ref&gt; After Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy, efforts at compromise failed and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that [[Europe]]an countries were so dependent on &quot;[[King Cotton]]&quot; that they would intervene,&lt;ref&gt;Yearns, Wilfred Buck. [| The Confederate Congress]. University of Georgia Press, 1960, 2010, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; but none did, and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.

Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|fired upon Fort Sumter]]. While in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] the Union made significant permanent gains, in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], the battle was inconclusive during 1861–1862. Later, in September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;proclamation&quot; /&gt; To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as the [[Reconstruction era]].

The American Civil War was among the earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]]. Railroads, the [[telegraph]], steamships, and [[Ironclad warship|iron-clad]] ships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation, and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and subsequent conflicts. It remains the deadliest war in [[History of the United States|American history]]. From 1861 to 1865, it is estimated that 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers died,&lt;ref name=&quot;hacker&quot; /&gt; along with an undetermined number of [[civilian casualties|civilians]].{{refn|name=Casualties|group=lower-alpha|A novel way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307–48}}}} By one estimate, the war claimed the lives of 10 percent of all Northern men 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white men aged 18–40.{{sfn|Huddleston|2002|p=3}}

==Causes of secession==
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War|Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War}}
The causes of secession were complex and have been controversial since the war began, but most academic scholars&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;slavery as a central cause of the war. James C. Bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated by [[Historical negationism|historical revisionists]], who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Bradford]], ''A Companion to American Military History'' (2010), vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the [[Timeline of United States history (1820–1859)#1850s|1850s]]. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]]. After Lincoln won, many Southern leaders felt that disunion was their only option, fearing that the loss of representation would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=w_2odcYG-swC|page=99}}|title=The Road to Disunion: Volume II: Secessionists Triumphant, 1854–1861|last=Freehling|first=William W.|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199839919|language=en|pp= 9–24}} {{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=X_JGtAEACAAJ|page=111}}|title=Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress: 1789-1988|last=Martis|first=Kenneth C.|date=1989|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Books For Young Readers|isbn=9780029201701|language=| pp= 111–115}} and {{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=rQSYk-LWTxcC|page=18}}|title=Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War|last=Foner|first=Eric|date=October 2, 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199727087|language=en |pp= 18–20, 21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Coates|first1=Ta-Nehisi|title=What This Cruel War Was Over|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/|accessdate=December 21, 2016|magazine=The Atlantic|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Fleming points to the historical phrase &quot;a disease in the public mind&quot; used by critics of this idea, and proposes it contributed to the segregation in the [[Jim Crow]] era following emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Disease in the Public Mind: A New Understanding of Why We Fought the Civil War |author=Thomas Fleming |year=2014 |isbn=978-0306822957}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fears were exacerbated by the [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|recent attempt]] of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] to instigate an armed slave rebellion in the South.

Slavery was illegal in much of the North, having been outlawed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was also fading in the border states and in Southern cities, but it was expanding in the highly profitable cotton districts of the rural South and Southwest. Subsequent writers on the American Civil War looked to several factors explaining the geographic divide.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Territorial crisis===
{{Further|Slave states and free states}}
Between 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest. At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49–50}}

With the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190–93}}
Northern &quot;free soil&quot; interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the Southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13–14}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: &quot;The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.&quot;{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}

By 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories, and they all claimed they were sanctioned by the Constitution, implicitly or explicitly.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|pp=19–21}} The first of these &quot;conservative&quot; theories, represented by the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], argued that the [[Missouri Compromise]] apportionment of territory north for free soil and south for slavery should become a Constitutional mandate. The [[Crittenden Compromise]] of 1860 was an expression of this view.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=20}}

The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance—that slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 at the discretion of Congress;{{sfn|Russell|1966|p=468–69}} thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The [[Wilmot Proviso]] announced this position in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Eff8PJuBt5IC}}|title=American Law and the Constitutional Order: Historical Perspectives|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=69|issue=2|pages=327–352|editor-last=Friedman|editor-first=Lawrence Meir|editor-last2=Scheiber|editor-first2=Harry N.|date=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674025271|language=en|last=Bestor |first=Arthur |chapter=The American Civil War as a Constitutional Crisis |jstor=1844986|doi=10.2307/1844986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] proclaimed the doctrine of territorial or &quot;popular&quot; sovereignty—which asserted that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to establish or disestablish slavery as a purely local matter.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|pp=21–23}} The [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854 legislated this doctrine.{{sfn|Johannsen|1973|p=406}} In the Kansas Territory, years of [[Bleeding Kansas|pro and anti-slavery violence]] and political conflict erupted; the congressional House of Representatives voted to admit Kansas as a free state in early 1860, but its admission in the Senate was delayed until January 1861, after the 1860 elections when Southern states began to leave.&lt;ref name=Politics&gt;{{cite web|title=Territorial Politics and Government |url=http://www.territorialkansasonline.org/~imlskto/cgi-bin/index.php?SCREEN=pol_govt&amp;option=more |publisher=Territorial Kansas Online: University of Kansas and Kansas Historical Society| accessdate=July 10, 2014}}Finteg&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth theory was advocated by Mississippi Senator [[Jefferson Davis]],{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=21}} one of state sovereignty (&quot;states' rights&quot;),{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=23}} also known as the &quot;Calhoun doctrine&quot;,{{sfn|Varon|2008|p=58}} named after the South Carolinian political theorist and statesman [[John C. Calhoun]].{{sfn|Russell|1966|p=470}} Rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the federal union under the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=23–24}} &quot;States' rights&quot; was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=7}} As historian Thomas L. Krannawitter points out, the &quot;Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power.&quot;{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=232}}&lt;ref&gt;Gara, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;190&lt;/ref&gt; These four doctrines comprised the dominant ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery, the territories, and the U.S. Constitution before the 1860 presidential election.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=24–25}}

===States' rights===
The South argued that just as each state had decided to join the Union, a state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], who said they were setting up a perpetual union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot; /&gt; Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

{{quote|While [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|one or more of these interpretations]] remain popular among the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the states'-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, states' rights for what purpose? States' rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=3–9}}}}

===Sectionalism===
[[Sectionalism]] resulted from the different economies, social structure, customs, and political values of the North and South.&lt;ref name=&quot;sectionalism&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sectionalism17&quot; /&gt; Regional tensions came to a head during the [[War of 1812]], resulting in the [[Hartford Convention]], which manifested Northern dissastisfaction with a foreign trade embargo that affected the industrial North disproportionately, the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], dilution of Northern power by new states, and a succession of [[Virginia dynasty|Southern presidents]]. Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648–649}}

Historians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the [[economic determinism]] of historian [[Charles A. Beard]] in the 1920s, and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. While socially different, the sections economically benefited each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;progressive&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Woodworth|1996|p=145, 151, 505, 512, 554, 557, 684}}

===Protectionism===
Slave owners preferred low-cost manual labor with no mechanization. Northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade.{{sfn|Thornton|Ekelund|2004|p=21}} The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816. The Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;taussig&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Hofstadter|1938|p=50–55}} The tariff issue was a Northern grievance. However, [[neo-Confederate]] writers have claimed it as a Southern grievance. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gray Gunderson, ''Old Gentleman's Convention: The Washington Peace Conference of 1861.'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon L. Wakelyn|title=Southern Pamphlets on Secession, November 1860 – April 1861|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=By6K9VHfWtIC|page=23}}|year=1996|publisher=U. of North Carolina Press|pages=23–30|isbn=978-0-8078-6614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism and honor===
Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called &quot;unionists&quot;) and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy.{{sfn|Potter|1962|p=924–50}} [[C. Vann Woodward]] said of the latter group,
{{quote|A great slave society&amp;nbsp;... had grown up and miraculously flourished in the heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic. It had renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized its institutional, legal, metaphysical, and religious defenses&amp;nbsp;... When the crisis came it chose to fight. It proved to be the death struggle of a society, which went down in ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpoint&quot; /&gt;}}
Perceived insults to Southern collective honor included the enormous popularity of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852)&lt;ref name=&quot;southern&quot; /&gt; and the actions of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in trying to incite a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|slave rebellion]] in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism&quot; /&gt; Adding to feelings of Nationalism and honor was the pervasive sense of cultural pessimism for the future of Southern society. Abolitionism, feminism, and socialism all threatened the Southern social order. For some Southern intellectuals, the social rationale for a new nation inaugurated a “proto-fascist” discourse in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roel Reyes|first=Stefan|date=2019-12-17|title=Antebellum Palingenetic Ultranationalism: The Case for including the United States in Comparative Fascist Studies|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/fasc/8/2/article-p307_307.xml|journal=Fascism|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=307–330|doi=10.1163/22116257-00802005|issn=2211-6257|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the South moved towards a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded, and they rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as [[treason]] and would not tolerate it: &quot;We denounce those threats of disunion&amp;nbsp;... as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;republican18&quot; /&gt; The South ignored the warnings: Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism19&quot; /&gt;

===Lincoln's election===
{{Main|1860 United States presidential election}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln seated, Feb 9, 1864.jpg|thumb|190px|Abraham Lincoln in 1864]]

The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.{{sfn|Potter|Fehrenbacher|1976|p=485}} Efforts at compromise, including the &quot;[[Corwin Amendment]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Crittenden Compromise]]&quot;, failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.

According to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of the war==

===Secession crisis===
The election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession. Prior to the war, South Carolina did more than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the right to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] federal laws, and even to secede from the United States. The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the &quot;[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]&quot;. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. The &quot;cotton states&quot; of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit, seceding in January and February 1861.

Among the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states, those of three—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned the plight of the &quot;slaveholding states&quot; at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no mention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp Ordinances of Secession by State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611023102/http://civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp |date=June 11, 2004 }}.

Retrieved November 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—also passed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession, all of which laid the blame squarely on the movement to abolish slavery and that movement's influence over the politics of the northern states. The southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] of the Constitution. These states agreed to form a new federal government, the [[Confederate States of America]], on February 4, 1861.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=24}} They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [[Dred Scott decision]] was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union &quot;was intended to be perpetual&quot;, but that &quot;The power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union&quot; was not among the &quot;enumerated powers granted to Congress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucsb&quot; /&gt; One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [[David E. Twiggs]], who then joined the Confederacy.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war. These included the [[Morrill Tariff]], land grant colleges (the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]]), a [[Homestead Acts#Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]], a transcontinental railroad (the [[Pacific Railroad Acts]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4608/ |title=Profile Showing the Grades upon the Different Routes Surveyed for the Union Pacific Rail Road Between the Missouri River and the Valley of the Platte River |publisher=[[World Digital Library]] |year=1865 |accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Bank Act]] and the authorization of [[United States Note]]s by the [[Legal Tender Act of 1862]]. The [[Revenue Act of 1861]] introduced the [[income tax]] to help finance the war.

On December 18, 1860, the [[Crittenden Compromise]] was proposed to re-establish the [[Missouri Compromise]] line by constitutionally banning slavery in territories to the north of the line while guaranteeing it to the south. The adoption of this compromise likely would have prevented the secession of every southern state apart from South Carolina, but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, James Ford. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofunite03rhod#page/41/mode/1up History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 to the McKinley-Bryan campaign of 1896] Volume III (1920) pp. 41–66&lt;/ref&gt; It was then proposed to hold a national referendum on the compromise. The Republicans again rejected the idea, although a majority of both Northerners and Southerners would likely have voted in favor of it.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, James Ford. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofunite03rhod#page/147/mode/1up History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 to the McKinley-Bryan campaign of 1896] Volume III (1920) pp. 147–52&lt;/ref&gt; A pre-war February [[Peace Conference of 1861]] met in Washington, proposing a solution similar to that of the Crittenden compromise, it was rejected by Congress. The Republicans proposed an [[Corwin Amendment|alternative compromise]] to not interfere with slavery where it existed but the South regarded it as insufficient. Nonetheless, the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=234–266}}

[[File:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jefferson Davis]], [[President of the Confederate States of America]] (1861–1865)|alt=Middle-aged man in a goatee posed standing in a suit, vest and bowtie]]

On March 4, 1861, [[Abraham Lincoln]] was sworn in as President. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a ''[[Preamble to the United States Constitution|more perfect union]]'' than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession &quot;legally void&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaugural&quot; /&gt; He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but said that he would use force to maintain possession of Federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. marshals and judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia, and North Carolina. He stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify armed revolution during his administration. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union, famously calling on &quot;the mystic chords of memory&quot; binding the two regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaugural&quot; /&gt;

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties{{which|date=January 2018}} and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.{{sfn|Potter|Fehrenbacher|1976|p=572–73}} Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], who at the time saw himself as the real governor or &quot;prime minister&quot; behind the throne of the inexperienced Lincoln, engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.{{sfn|Potter|Fehrenbacher|1976|p=572–73}} President Lincoln was determined to hold all remaining Union-occupied forts in the Confederacy: [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, [[Fort Pickens]], [[Fort Jefferson (Florida)|Fort Jefferson]] and [[Fort Zachary Taylor|Fort Taylor]] in Florida, and [[Fort Sumter]] – located at the cockpit of secession in Charleston, South Carolina.

===Battle of Fort Sumter===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Fort sumter 1861.jpg|thumb|left|The Confederate &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; flying from Fort Sumter]]
Fort Sumter was located in the middle of the harbor of [[Charleston in the American Civil War|Charleston]], South Carolina. Its garrison recently moved there to avoid incidents with local militias in the streets of the city. Lincoln told its commander, [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Maj. Anderson]] to hold on until fired upon. Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered the surrender of the fort. Anderson gave a conditional reply that the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. He bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12–13, forcing its capitulation.

The attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] underscored the significance of the event:
{{quote|&quot;The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment.&amp;nbsp;... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The War for the Union: The Improvised War 1861–1862'' (1959), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Union leaders incorrectly assumed that only a minority of Southerners were in favor of secession and that there were large numbers of southern Unionists that could be counted on. Had Northerners realized that most Southerners favored secession, they might have hesitated at attempting the enormous task of conquering a united South.&lt;ref&gt;James Ford Rhodes, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofunite03rhod#page/291/mode/1up History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 to the McKinley-Bryan campaign of 1896] Volume III (1920) pp. 291–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln called on all the states to send forces to recapture the fort and other federal properties. The scale of the rebellion appeared to be small, so he called for only [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 volunteers]] for 90&amp;nbsp;days.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=274}} The governor of Massachusetts had state regiments on trains headed south the next day.

Four states in the middle and upper South had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, but now [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy.

[[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]] were slave states that were opposed to both secession and coercing the South. [[West Virginia]] then joined them as an additional border state after it separated from [[Virginia]] and became a state of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1863.

Maryland's territory surrounded the United States' capital of [[Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C.]], and could cut it off from the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/7590/html/0000.html|title=Civil War and the Maryland General Assembly, Maryland State Archives|website=msa.maryland.gov|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had numerous anti-Lincoln officials who tolerated anti-army [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and the burning of bridges, both aimed at hindering the passage of troops to the South.

In Missouri, an [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861–63)|elected convention]] on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state (''see also'': [[Missouri secession]]). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins&quot; /&gt;

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces in 1861, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, formed the shadow [[Confederate Government of Kentucky]], inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth and went into exile for good after October 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins26&quot; /&gt;

After Virginia's secession, a [[Restored Government of Virginia|Unionist government]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34 percent approved the statehood bill (96 percent approving).&lt;ref name=&quot;Convenience WV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/History/statehood/statehood10.html |title=A State of Convenience, The Creation of West Virginia |publisher=West Virginia Archives &amp; History |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties&lt;ref name=&quot;copperhead&quot; /&gt; in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war engaged about 40,000 Federal troops for much of the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=303}}{{sfn|Weigley|2004|p=55}} Congress admitted [[West Virginia]] to the Union on June 20, 1863.

A Unionist secession attempt occurred in [[East Tennessee]], but was suppressed by the Confederacy, which arrested over 3,000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union. They were held without trial.{{sfn|Neely|1993|p=10–11}}

==General features of the War==
{{See also|List of American Civil War battles|Military leadership in the American Civil War}}The Civil War was a contest marked by the ferocity and frequency of battle. Over four years, 237 named battles were fought, as were many more minor actions and skirmishes, which were often characterized by their bitter intensity and high casualties. In his book ''The American Civil War'', John Keegan writes that &quot;The American Civil War was to prove one of the most ferocious wars ever fought&quot;. In many cases, without geographic objectives, the only target for each side was the enemy's soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, &quot;The American Civil War&quot;, p. 73. Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40 percent of them in Virginia and Tennessee. See Gabor Boritt, ed. ''War Comes Again'' (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobilization===
{{See also|Child soldiers in the American Civil War}}
As the first seven states began organizing a Confederacy in Montgomery, the entire U.S. army numbered 16,000. However, Northern governors had begun to mobilize their militias.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;With an actual strength of 1,080 officers and 14,926 enlisted men on June 30, 1860, the Regular Army&amp;nbsp;...&quot; [http://www.history.army.mil/html/bookshelves/resmat/civil_war/extracts/the_civil_war_1861_(pg_199-221).pdf Civil War Extracts] pp.&amp;nbsp;199–221, American Military History.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate Congress authorized the new nation up to 100,000 troops sent by governors as early as February. By May, Jefferson Davis was pushing for 100,000 men under arms for one year or the duration, and that was answered in kind by the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9lAfAQAAIAAJ|page=264}}|title=Abraham Lincoln: A History|last=Nicolay|first=John George|last2=Hay|first2=John|date=1890|publisher=Century Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Z2_ZM0dWVrsC|page=308}}|title=The Confederate States of America, 1861—1865: A History of the South|last=Coulter|first=E.

In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law—[[conscription]]—as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;questia&quot; /&gt; The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. European [[History of Immigration to the United States#1850 to 1930|immigrants]] joined the [[Union Army]] in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4xgOAAAAIAAJ|page=523}}|title=The German Element in the United States: With Special Reference to Its Political, Moral, Social, and Educational Influence|last=Faust|first=Albert Bernhardt|date=1909|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|language=en}} The railroads and banks grew rapidly.

When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City]] in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the [[Tammany Hall|city's Democratic political machine]], not realizing it made them liable for the draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;reconstruct&quot; /&gt; Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.&lt;ref name=&quot;murdock&quot; /&gt;

In both the North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular. In the North, some 120,000 men evaded conscription, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 soldiers deserted during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lee Hallock, &quot;The Role of the Community in Civil War Desertion.&quot; ''Civil War History'' (1983) 29#2 pp. 123–34. [http://mtw160-198.ippl.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v029/29.2.hallock.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; At least 100,000 Southerners deserted, or about 10 percent.

From a tiny frontier force in 1860, the Union and Confederate armies had grown into the &quot;largest and most efficient armies in the world&quot; within a few years. European observers at the time dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional, but British historian [[John Keegan]] concluded that each outmatched the French, Prussian and Russian armies of the time, and but for the Atlantic, would have threatened any of them with defeat.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=57}}

====Women====
The number of women who served as soldiers during the war is estimated at between 400 and 750, although an accurate count is impossible because the women had to disguise themselves as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/untold-stories/female-soldiers-in-the-civil.html |title=Female Soldiers in the Civil War |publisher=Civilwar.org |date= January 25, 2013|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also served on the Union hospital ship ''Red Rover'' and nursed Union and Confederate troops at field hospitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;womensmemorial.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |title=Highlights in the History of Military Women |website=Women In Military Service For America Memorial |accessdate=June 22, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403045042/http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate=April 3, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
Perman and Taylor (2010) write that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:
{{quote|Some historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that no matter what a soldier thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes altered his reasons for continuing the fight.{{sfn|Perman|Taylor|2010|p=177}}}}

===Prisoners===
{{Main|American Civil War prison camps}}
At the start of the civil war, a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their army. They were paid, but they were not allowed to perform any military duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Pickenpaugh|title=Captives in Blue: The Civil War Prisons of the Confederacy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pWOfsOceCNUC|page=57}}|year=2013|publisher=University of Alabama Press|pages=57–73|isbn=9780817317836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. After that, about 56,000 of the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the war, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the conflict's fatalities.{{sfn|Tucker|Pierpaoli|White|2010|p=1466}}

==Naval tactics==
The small [[Union Navy|U.S. Navy]] of 1861 was rapidly enlarged to 6,000 officers and 45,000 men in 1865, with 671 vessels, having a tonnage of 510,396.{{sfn|Welles|1865|p=152}}{{sfn|Tucker|Pierpaoli|White|2010|p=462}} Its mission was to blockade Confederate ports, take control of the river system, defend against Confederate raiders on the high seas, and be ready for a possible war with the British [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Canney|1998|p=?}} Meanwhile, the main riverine war was fought in the West, where a series of major rivers gave access to the Confederate heartland. The U.S. Navy eventually gained control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.

===Modern navy evolves===
[[File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Clashes on the rivers were melees of [[ironclads]], [[Cottonclad warship|cottonclads]], [[gunboats]] and rams, complicated by torpedoes and [[Fire ship|fire rafts]].]]The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the [[ironclad warship]]. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=92}} Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating &quot;ram fever&quot; among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}}

[[File:Battle of Hampton Roads 3g01752u.jpg|240px|thumb|left| Battle between the Monitor and Merrimack.]]

In addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action.&lt;ref&gt;Myron J. Smith, ''Tinclads in the Civil War: Union Light-Draught Gunboat Operations on Western Waters, 1862–1865'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy experimented with the [[submarine]] {{ship|CSS|Hunley}}, which did not work satisfactorily,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald F. Teaster and Linda and James Treaster Ambrose, ''The Confederate Submarine H. L. Hunley'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and with building an ironclad ship, {{ship|CSS|Virginia}}, which was based on rebuilding a sunken Union ship, {{USS|Merrimack|1855|2}}. On its first foray on March 8, 1862, ''Virginia'' inflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad, {{USS|Monitor}}, arrived to challenge it in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The resulting three hour [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] was a draw, but it proved that ironclads were effective warships.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=345}} Not long after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the ''Virginia'' to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''. Lacking the technology and infrastructure to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain.{{sfn|Fuller|2008|p=36}}

=== Union blockade ===

By early 1861, General [[Winfield Scott]] had devised the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible.{{sfn|Richter|2009|p=49}} Scott argued that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln adopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day volunteers. Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=228}}

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. &quot;King Cotton&quot; was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288–89, 296–98}}

British investors built small, fast, steam-driven [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Britain through Bermuda, Cuba, and the Bahamas in return for high-priced cotton. Many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out.{{sfn|Stern|1962|pp=224–225}} When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a [[Prize of war]] and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British, and they were released.&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Neely, Jr. &quot;The Perils of Running the Blockade: The Influence of International Law in an Era of Total War,&quot; ''Civil War History'' (1986) 32#2, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–18 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v032/32.2.neely.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic impact====
The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war. There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.

Most historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Surdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade, so they stopped calling at Confederate ports.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

To fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15 million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}

Although the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546–57}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}

[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that &quot;King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton&quot;, as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins73&quot; /&gt;

Lincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was &quot;absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014), pp. 8 (quote), 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. [[ambassador|minister]] to Britain [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept and convinced Britain not to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ({{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}, {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}}, {{ship|CSS|Florida}}, and some others). The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.&lt;ref name=&quot;approaching&quot; /&gt;

The Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}

==Eastern theater==
[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]

{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].

=== Background ===

; Army of the Potomac 
Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}

# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.
# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.
# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.
# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.
[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]
; Army of Northern Virginia

The primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.

When Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.

Lee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.

=== Battles ===

;First Bull Run

In one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). 
[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|&quot;Stonewall&quot; got his nickname at Bull Run.]]
The Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, &quot;Stonewall&quot;.

; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign
[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]
Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464–519}}&lt;ref name=&quot;terrible&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424–27}}

Also in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&amp;nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Frémont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of &quot;[[foot cavalry]]&quot;.

Johnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538–44}}

;Second Bull Run
The [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528–33}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.

;Antietam
[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538–44}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543–45}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=557–558}}

;First Fredericksburg
When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=571–74}} on December 13, 1862, when more than 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].
[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Confederate dead overrun at Marye's Heights, reoccupied next day May 4, 1863]]
;Chancellorsville
Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, his Chancellorsville Campaign proved ineffective and he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=639–45}} Chancellorsville is known as Lee's &quot;perfect battle&quot; because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory. Gen. Stonewall Jackson was shot in the arm by accidental friendly fire during the battle and subsequently died of complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EHRDCgAAQBAJ|page=93}}|page=93|title=Stonewall Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign|author=Jonathan A. Noyalas
|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|date=December 3, 2010|isbn=9781614230403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee famously said &quot;He has lost his left arm; but I have lost my right arm.&quot;

The fiercest fighting of the battle—and the second bloodiest day of the Civil War—occurred on May 3 as Lee launched multiple attacks against the Union position at Chancellorsville. That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west. The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the [[Battle of Salem Church]].

;Gettysburg
[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L. Prang and Co. - Battle of Gettysburg - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|260px|Pickett's Charge]]
Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]] during Lee's [[Gettysburg Campaign|second invasion of the North]], in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (July 1 to 3, 1863).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=653–663}} This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=664}} However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat.

==Western theater==
{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
The Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the [[Mississippi River]], including the states of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]], as well as parts of [[Louisiana]].

=== Background ===

; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland 
[[File:Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (4228634580).jpg|thumb|160px|Ulysses S. Grant]]
The primary Union forces in the Western theater were the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and the [[Army of the Cumberland]], named for the two rivers, the [[Tennessee River]] and [[Cumberland River]]. After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

; Army of Tennessee 
The primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.

=== Battles ===
;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.

[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's &quot;Gibraltar of the West&quot; at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.

[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]
;Shiloh
At [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed additional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won a decisive victory—the first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over.{{sfn|Frank|Reaves|2003|p= 170}} The Confederates lost [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], considered their finest general before the emergence of Lee.

;Union Navy captures Memphis
[[File:Cgs05255 (9716190703).jpg|thumb|By 1863 the Union controlled large portions of the Western Theater, especially areas surrounding the Mississippi river]]
One of the early Union objectives in the war was the capture of the [[Mississippi River]], in order to cut the Confederacy in half. The Mississippi River was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], Missouri, and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

In April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] [[Capture of New Orleans|captured New Orleans]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=418–20}} &quot;The key to the river was New Orleans, the South's largest port [and] greatest industrial center.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Naval forces under [[David Farragut|Farragut]] ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans. Confederate forces abandoned the city, giving the Union a critical anchor in the deep South.{{sfn|Symonds|Clipson|2001|p= 92}} which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. [[Battle of Memphis|Memphis fell to Union forces]] on June 6, 1862, and became a key base for further advances south along the Mississippi River. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, prevented Union control of the entire river.

;Perryville
Bragg's second invasion of Kentucky in the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive]] included initial successes such as [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]]'s triumph at the [[Battle of Richmond]] and the capture of the Kentucky capital of Frankfort on September 3, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Kent Masterson |title=The Civil War in Kentucky: Battle for the Bluegrass State |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the [[Battle of Perryville]]. Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of logistical support and lack of infantry recruits for the Confederacy in that state.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=419–20}}

; Stones River 
Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in [[Tennessee]], the culmination of the [[Stones River Campaign]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=480–83}}

;Vicksburg 
Naval forces assisted Grant in the long, complex [[Vicksburg Campaign]] that resulted in the Confederates surrendering at the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vicksburg]] in July 1863, which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning points]] of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Scott Mangum, &quot;The Vicksburg Campaign: A Study In Joint Operations,&quot; ''Parameters: U.S. Army War College'' (1991) 21#3, pp.&amp;nbsp;74–86 [https://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/Articles/1991/1991%20mangum.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127192600/https://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/Articles/1991/1991%20mangum.pdf |date=November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chickamauga
[[File:Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the highest two-day losses.]]

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. After Rosecrans successful [[Tullahoma Campaign]], Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]].

; Third Chattanooga 
Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged in the [[Chattanooga Campaign]]. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Third Battle of Chattanooga]],{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=677–80}} eventually causing Longstreet to abandon his [[Knoxville Campaign]] and driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

==Trans-Mississippi theater==
{{details|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}

=== Background ===
The Trans-Mississippi theater refers to military operations west of the Mississippi River, not including the areas bordering the Pacific Ocean.

=== Battles ===
;Missouri
[[File:Wilson's Creek charge of 1st Iowa.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Nathaniel Lyon]] secured St. Louis docks and arsenal, led Union forces to expel Missouri Confederate forces and government.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=100}}]]
The first battle of the Trans-Mississippi theater was the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]]. The Confederates were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=404–05}}

Extensive [[guerrilla warfare]] characterized the trans-Mississippi region, as the Confederacy lacked the troops and the logistics to support regular armies that could challenge Union control.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Martin, ''Third War: Irregular Warfare on the Western Border 1861–1865'' (Combat Studies Institute Leavenworth Paper series, number 23, 2012). See also, Michael Fellman, ''Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri during the Civil War'' (1989). Missouri alone was the scene of over 1,000 engagements between regular units, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands, especially in the recently settled western counties.&lt;/ref&gt; Roving Confederate bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohl|first1=Sarah|year=2004|title=A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri|journal=Prologue|volume=36|issue=1|pages=44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; and &quot;Order of the American Knights&quot; attacked pro-Union people, elected officeholders, and unarmed uniformed soldiers. These partisans could not be entirely driven out of the state of Missouri until an entire regular Union infantry division was engaged. By 1864, these violent activities harmed the nationwide anti-war movement organizing against the re-election of Lincoln. Missouri not only stayed in the Union, but Lincoln took 70 percent of the vote for re-election.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=270}}

;New Mexico
Numerous small-scale military actions south and west of Missouri sought to control [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|New Mexico Territory]] for the Union. The [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] was the decisive [[battle]] of the [[New Mexico Campaign]]. The Union repulsed Confederate incursions into New Mexico in 1862, and the exiled Arizona government withdrew into Texas. In the Indian Territory, civil war broke out within tribes. About 12,000 Indian warriors fought for the Confederacy, and smaller numbers for the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=William H.|year=1991|title=Indian Soldiers for the Gray Army: Confederate Recruitment in Indian Territory|url=|journal=Chronicles of Oklahoma|volume=69|issue=2|pages=134–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Cherokee was Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]], the last Confederate general to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neet|first1=J.

;Texas
After the fall of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] in July 1863, General Kirby Smith in Texas was informed by Jefferson Davis that he could expect no further help from east of the Mississippi River. Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies, he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler, along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy, a virtual &quot;independent fiefdom&quot; in Texas, including railroad construction and international smuggling. The Union in turn did not directly engage him.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=220–21}} Its 1864 [[Red River Campaign]] to take Shreveport, Louisiana, was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.

== Lower Seaboard theater ==
{{details|Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War}}

=== Background ===
The Lower Seaboard theater refers to military and naval operations that occurred near the coastal areas of the Southeast (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas) as well as southern part of the Mississippi River (Port Hudson and south). Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.

=== Battles ===
;South Carolina
One of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.

;Georgia
Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.

;Louisiana
[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]
In April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname &quot;Beast&quot;.

The following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]], but surrendered after Vicksburg. These two surrenders gave the Union control over the entire Mississippi.

;Florida
Several small skirmishes were fought in Florida, but no major battles. The biggest was the [[Battle of Olustee]] in early 1864.

==Pacific Coast theater==
{{details|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}
The Pacific Coast theater refers to military operations on the Pacific Ocean and in the states and Territories west of the Continental Divide.

==Conquest of Virginia==
[[File:William-Tecumseh-Sherman.jpg|thumb|160px|William Tecumseh Sherman]]
At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said &quot;would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion. This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=U.S. Grant |title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant; Selected Letters |year=1990 |publisher=Library of America |page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsselectedl00gran_0/page/247 247] |isbn=978-0-940450-58-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsselectedl00gran_0/page/247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions.

[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|left|These dead soldiers—from [[Richard S. Ewell|Ewell]]'s May 1864 attack at [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]]—delayed Grant's advance on Richmond in the [[Overland Campaign]].]]

=== Grant's Overland Campaign ===
Grant's army set out on the [[Overland Campaign]] with the goal of drawing Lee into a defense of Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.

An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724–42}}
[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]

=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===
Grant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778–79}}

=== Sherman's March to the Sea ===
Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=773–76}} Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin–Nashville Campaign]]. Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=812–15}}[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|thumb|''[[The Peacemakers]]'' by [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] portrays [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and [[David Dixon Porter|Porter]] discussing plans for the last weeks of the Civil War aboard the steamer ''[[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]]'' in March 1865.]]

Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20 percent of the farms in Georgia in his &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;. He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825–30}}

=== The Waterloo of the Confederacy ===
Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called &quot;the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy&quot;) on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=846–47}}

Initially, Lee did not intend to surrender, but planned to regroup at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|village of Appomattox Court House]], where supplies were to be waiting, and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him, so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded. After an initial battle, Lee decided that the fight was now hopeless, and surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the [[McLean House (Appomattox, Virginia)|McLean House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;appomattox&quot; /&gt; In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]].

On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Southern sympathizer. Lincoln died early the next morning, and [[Andrew Johnson]] became the president. Meanwhile, Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee's surrender reached them.&lt;ref name=&quot;surrender&quot; /&gt; On April 26, 1865, General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] surrendered nearly 90,000 men of the [[Army of Tennessee]] to Major General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] at the [[Bennett Place]] near present-day Durham, North Carolina. It proved to be the largest surrender of Confederate forces, effectively bringing the war to an end.

The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for its outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]] are subjects of lingering contention today. The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}

Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=855}} McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy&quot; /&gt;

Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy&quot; /&gt; Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771–72}}

Many scholars argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat.{{sfn|Murray|Bernstein|Knox|1996|p=235}}{{sfn|HeidlerHeidlerColes|2002|p=1207–10}} Civil War historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back&amp;nbsp;... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot;{{sfn|Ward|1990|p=272}}

A minority view among historians is that the Confederacy lost because, as [[E. Merton Coulter]] put it, &quot;people did not will hard enough and long enough to win.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;E. Merton Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America, 1861–1865'' (1950), p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Beringer, Herman Hattaway, Archer Jones and William N. Still Jr, ''Why the South Lost the Civil War'' (1991), ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Charles H. Wilson]], in ''The Collapse of the Confederacy'', &quot;internal conflict should figure prominently in any explanation of Confederate defeat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist historian Armstead Robinson agrees, pointing to a class conflict in the Confederate army between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners. He argues that the non-owner soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve slavery, and fought less enthusiastically. He attributes the major Confederate defeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Armstead Robinson, ''Bitter Fruits of Bondage: The Demise of Slavery and the Collapse of the Confederacy, 1861–1865'' (University of Virginia Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; However, most historians reject the argument.&lt;ref&gt;see Alan Farmer, [http://www.historytoday.com/alan-farmer/why-was-confederacy-defeated ''History Review'' (2005)], No. 52: 15–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James M. McPherson]], after reading thousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism that continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he says most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard.{{sfn|McPherson|1997|pp=169–72}} Historian [[Gary Gallagher]] cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, &quot;The devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired.&quot; Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, &quot;yet I see no sign of let up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out.&quot;{{sfn|Gallagher|1999|p=57}}

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarLeader&quot; /&gt; The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382–88}}

Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:

{{quote|The North's victory decisively proved the durability of democratic government.

Confederate records compiled by historian William F. Fox list 74,524 killed and died of wounds and 59,292 died of disease.

Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L. Livermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths at 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a total of 260,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwarhome.com&quot; /&gt; However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.

The United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses:&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;/&gt;

While the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. [[Francis Amasa Walker]], superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;recounting&quot;/&gt;

Analyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307–48}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.

Deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Professor James Downs. &quot;Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction&quot;. January 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Losses were far higher than during the recent [[Mexican–American War|defeat of Mexico]], which saw roughly thirteen thousand American deaths, including fewer than two thousand killed in battle, between 1846 and 1848. One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Minié ball]]s, and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of [[trench warfare]], a style of fighting that defined much of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Field and Peter Dennis|title=American Civil War Fortifications (2): Land and Field Fortifications|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5QUWAAAAQBAJ|page=4}}|date= 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=4|isbn=9781472805317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wealth amassed in slaves and slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied before the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Goldin, &quot;The economics of emancipation.&quot; ''The Journal of Economic History'' 33#1 (1973): 66–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South. All accumulated investment Confederate bonds was forfeit; most banks and railroads were bankrupt. Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40 percent of that of the North, a condition that lasted until well into the 20th century. Southern influence in the U.S. federal government, previously considerable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot; /&gt; The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]].

====Slavery as a war issue====
While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery, most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]]'s army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], not to abolish slavery.{{sfn|Foner|1981|p=?}} Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal.{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=74}} Lincoln's decision to issue the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] angered both [[Peace Democrats]] (&quot;Copperheads&quot;) and [[War Democrats]], but energized most Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp.&amp;nbsp;506–8.&lt;/ref&gt; By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the [[1862 congressional elections|1862 elections]], but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson. p.&amp;nbsp;686.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army.{{refn|name=BlacksUSATroops|group=lower-alpha|At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves &quot;...&amp;nbsp;cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.&quot;{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=495}} The same Congressman—and his fellow Radical Republicans—put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=355, 494–96, 495}} Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&amp;nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders—until 1865—opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, &quot;If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot; Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=831–37}} The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved south. Historian [[John D. Winters]] referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through [[Louisiana]]: &quot;As the troops moved up to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army. They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there.&quot;{{sfn|Winters|1963|p=237}} Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]]. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&amp;nbsp;335. This led to a breakdown of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|prisoner and mail exchange program]] and the growth of prison camps such as [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison]] in Georgia, where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=791–98}}}}

During the Civil War, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement and emancipation in the United States was divided. In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that &quot;to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861. Sentiment among [[German Americans]] was largely anti-slavery especially among [[Forty-Eighters]], resulting in hundreds of thousands of German Americans volunteering to fight for the Union. &quot; {{cite journal|last=Wittke|first=Carl|title=Refugees of Revolution|publisher=University of Pennsylvania press|location=Philadelphia|year=1952}} &quot;, Christian B. Keller, &quot;Flying Dutchmen and Drunken Irishmen: The Myths and Realities of Ethnic Civil War Soldiers&quot;, ''Journal of Military History'', Vol/ 73, No. 1, January 2009, pp. 117–45; for primary sources see Walter D. Kamphoefner and Wolfgang Helbich, eds, ''Germans in the Civil War: The Letters They Wrote Home'' (2006). &quot;On the other hand, many of the recent immigrants in the North viewed freed slaves as competition for scarce jobs, and as the reason why the Civil War was being fought.&quot; Baker, Kevin (March 2003).

Retrieved July 29, 2010. &quot;Due in large part to this fierce competition with free blacks for labor opportunities, the poor and working class [[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] generally opposed emancipation.

At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C. Frémont]] (in Missouri) and [[David Hunter]] (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats. Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, James, in Gabor S. Boritt, ed. ''Lincoln, the War President'', pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; But only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like &quot;our last shriek on the retreat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen B. Oates|Oates, Stephen B.]], ''Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln laid the groundwork for public support in an open letter published in abolitionist Horace Greeley's newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lincoln Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862, the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling, Sr. Anne Francis. &quot;Images of America: Altoona, 2001, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to [[Albert G. Hodges]], Lincoln explained his belief that &quot;If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong&amp;nbsp;... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling&amp;nbsp;... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves to fight for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) and Union-controlled regions around New Orleans, Norfolk and elsewhere, were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=SLAVERY in DELAWARE|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/delaware.htm|year=2003|accessdate=October 16, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016062740/http://slavenorth.com/delaware.htm| archivedate= October 16, 2007| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; James McPherson, The War that Never Goes Away&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Emancipation Proclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France.{{sfn|Asante|Mazama|2004|p=82}} By late 1864, Lincoln was playing a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made emancipation universal and permanent.{{sfn|Holzer|Gabbard|2007|p=172–174}}

===''Texas v. White''===
In ''[[Texas v. White]]'', {{ussc|74|700|1869}} the United States Supreme Court ruled that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]; the court further held that the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] did not permit [[U.S. state|states]] to unilaterally [[secession|secede]] from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were &quot;absolutely [[Void (law)|null]]&quot;, under the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp. 155–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|Northern teachers traveled into the South to provide education and training for the newly freed population.]]
Reconstruction began during the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and it continued until 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Hans L. Trefousse, ''Historical Dictionary of Reconstruction'' (Greenwood, 1991) covers all the main events and leaders.&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the war's aftermath, the most important of which were the three &quot;[[Reconstruction Amendments]]&quot; to the Constitution, which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a &quot;[[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]] for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery—and prevent semi-slavery status.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner's ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) is a brief survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. [[Radical Republicans]] demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. In 1872 the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|&quot;Liberal Republicans&quot;]] argued that the war goals had been achieved and that Reconstruction should end. They ran a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The [[Compromise of 1877]] closed with a national consensus that the Civil War had finally ended.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction'' (2nd edn 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature; the [[Jim Crow]] period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was about to begin.

===Post-War Politics===
The Civil War would have a huge impact on American politics in the years to come. Many veterans on the both sides were subsequently elected to political office, including five U. S. Presidents: [[U. S. Grant]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], [[James Garfield]], [[Benjamin Harrison]], and [[William McKinley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/presidents-who-were-civil-war-veterans.html | title=Presidents Who Were Civil War Veterans |website=Essential Civil War Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil War is one of the central events in American collective memory. There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;controversy&quot; /&gt; The last theme includes moral evaluations of [[racism]] and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an &quot;[[Empire of Liberty]]&quot; influencing the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;american83&quot; /&gt;

Professional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and who write for the general public, rather than the scholarly community. [[Bruce Catton]] and [[Shelby Foote]] are among the best-known writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven E. Woodworth|title=The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=rb3ANWoZt1YC|page=208}}|year=1996|page=208|isbn=9780313290190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Cushman|title=Belligerent Muse: Five Northern Writers and How They Shaped Our Understanding of the Civil War|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=95l6BAAAQBAJ|page=5}}|year=2014|pages=5–6|isbn=9781469618784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practically every major figure in the war, both North and South, has had a serious biographical study.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Ritter and Jon L. Wakelyn, eds., ''Leaders of the American Civil War: A Biographical and Historiographical Dictionary'' (1998) Provide short biographies and valuable historiographical summaries&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black [[Baptists|Baptist]] preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:
{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission—to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Fallin Jr, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:
{{quote|God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.&lt;ref&gt;Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Lost Cause===
{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}
Memory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|&quot;Lost Cause&quot;]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy84&quot; /&gt; Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly &quot;a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame&quot; of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|&quot;virulent racism&quot; of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause &quot;a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter&quot; in every instance.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beardian historiography===
The economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:

{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=9780307809605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battlefield preservation===
[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[Commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]

The first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga. Soldiers began erecting markers on battlefields beginning with the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but the oldest surviving monument is the Hazen monument, erected at Stones River near [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], in the summer of 1863 by soldiers in Union Col. [[William Babcock Hazen|William B.

The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899. In 1933, these five parks and other national monuments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy B. Smith, &quot;The Golden Age of Battlefield Preservation&quot; (2008; The University of Tennessee Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Civil War battlefield preservation movement began in 1987 with the founding of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), a grassroots organization created by Civil War historians and others to preserve battlefield land by acquiring it. In 1991, the original Civil War Trust was created in the mold of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of U.S. Mint Civil War commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation. Although the two non-profit organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions, ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger, which happened in 1999 with the creation of the Civil War Preservation Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behind-the-bitter-war-to-preserve-the-civil-war-battlefields/2017/07/21/6a1c8dd4-6591-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html] The Washington Post, July 21, 2007, &quot;&quot;Behind the bitter war to preserve Civil War battlefields.&quot; Accessed May 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the organization was renamed, again becoming the [[Civil War Trust]]. After expanding its mission in 2014 to include battlefields of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812, the non-profit became the [[American Battlefield Trust]] in May 2018, operating with two divisions, the Civil War Trust and the Revolutionary War Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.battlefields.org/news/national-historic-preservation-group-forms-american-battlefield-trust] [[American Battlefield Trust]] announcement, May 8, 2018. Accessed May 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1987 through May 2018, the Trust and its predecessor organizations, along with their partners, preserved 49,893 acres of battlefield land through acquisition of property or conservation easements at more than 130 battlefields in 24 states.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Zeller, &quot;Fighting the Second Civil War: A History of Battlefield Preservation and the Emergence of the Civil War Trust,&quot; (2017: Knox Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.battlefields.org/preserve/saved-land] [[American Battlefield Trust]] &quot;Saved Land&quot; page.

The five major Civil War battlefield parks operated by the National Park Service (Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, Chickamauga/Chattanooga and Vicksburg) had a combined 3.1 million visitors in 2018, down 70% from 10.2 million in 1970.

The American Civil War has been commemorated in many capacities ranging from the reenactment of battles, to statues and memorial halls erected, to films being produced, to stamps and coins with Civil War themes being issued, all of which helped to shape public memory. This varied advent occurred in greater proportions on the 100th and 150th anniversary.
&lt;ref name=&quot;gallagher&quot; /&gt;
[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such film classics as ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), and more recently ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' (2012). [[Ken Burns]] produced a notable PBS series on television titled ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990). It was digitally remastered and re-released in 2015.

===Technological significance===
Numerous technological innovations during the Civil War had a great impact on 19th-century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest examples of an &quot;[[Industrial warfare|industrial war]]&quot;, in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Thomas and David Kennedy: ''The American Pageant'', p. 434. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; New inventions, such as the [[Military railways|train]] and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], delivered soldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dome |first=Steam |year=1974 |title=A Civil War Iron Clad Car |journal=Railroad History |volume=130 |issue=Spring 1974 |pages=51–53 |publisher=The Railway &amp; Locomotive Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rattle Plum, ''The Military Telegraph During the Civil War in the United States'', ed.
