'''Arsenic''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&amp;nbsp;'''As''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;33. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with [[sulfur]] and [[metal]]s, but also as a pure elemental [[crystal]]. Arsenic is a [[metalloid]]. It has various [[allotropy|allotropes]], but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry.

The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of [[lead]] (for example, in [[car batteries]] and [[ammunition]]). Arsenic is a common n-type [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]] electronic devices, and the [[optoelectronic]] compound [[gallium arsenide]] is the second most commonly used semiconductor after [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[silicon]]. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of [[pesticide]]s, treated wood products, [[herbicide]]s, and [[insecticide]]s. These applications are declining due to the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|author = Grund, Sabina C. |author2 = Hanusch, Kunibert |author3 = Wolf, Hans Uwe |title = Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a03_113.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Bacteria|A few species of bacteria]] are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory [[metabolite]]s. Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential [[Mineral (nutrient)|dietary element]] in rats, hamsters, goats, chickens, and presumably other species. A role in human metabolism is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Anke M. Arsenic. In: Mertz W. ed., Trace elements in human and Animal Nutrition, 5th ed.

Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to [[tetraphosphorus]] ({{chem|P|4}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seidl |first1=Michael |last2=Balázs |first2=Gábor |last3=Scheer |first3=Manfred |title=The Chemistry of Yellow Arsenic |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=119 |issue=14 |pages=8406–8434 |date=22 March 2019 |doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00713|pmid=30900440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have four atoms arranged in a [[tetrahedral]] structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond.

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of arsenic}}

Arsenic occurs in nature as a [[monoisotopic element]], composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;As.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, at least 33 [[radioisotope]]s have also been synthesized, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;As with a [[half-life]] of 80.30&amp;nbsp;days. All other isotopes have half-lives of under one day, with the exception of &lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=65.30 hours), &lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=26.0 hours), &lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=17.77 days), &lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.0942 days), and &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;As (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=38.83 hours). Isotopes that are lighter than the stable &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;As tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], with some exceptions.

At least 10 [[nuclear isomer]]s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenic's isomers is &lt;sup&gt;68m&lt;/sup&gt;As with a half-life of 111&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot; /&gt;

=== Chemistry ===

Arsenic has a similar electronegativity and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and as such readily forms covalent molecules with most of the nonmetals. Though stable in dry air, arsenic forms a golden-bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer.&lt;ref name=Greenwood552&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 552–4&lt;/ref&gt; When heated in air, arsenic [[oxidation|oxidizes]] to [[arsenic trioxide]]; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling [[garlic]]. This odor can be detected on striking [[arsenide]] minerals such as [[arsenopyrite]] with a hammer.&lt;ref name=Gokcen1989/&gt; It burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and [[arsenic pentoxide]], which have the same structure as the more well-known phosphorus compounds, and in fluorine to give [[arsenic pentafluoride]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood552/&gt; Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimes]] upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at {{convert|887|K|C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gokcen1989&quot; /&gt; The [[triple point]] is 3.63&amp;nbsp;MPa and {{convert|1090|K|C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gokcen1989&quot; /&gt; Arsenic makes [[arsenic acid]] with concentrated [[nitric acid]], [[arsenous acid]] with dilute nitric acid, and [[arsenic trioxide]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]; however, it does not react with water, alkalis, or non-oxidising acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Arsenic |volume=2 |pages=651–654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic reacts with metals to form [[arsenide]]s, though these are not ionic compounds containing the As&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group 1 arsenides have properties of [[intermetallic]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood552/&gt; Like [[germanium]], [[selenium]], and [[bromine]], which like arsenic [[d-block contraction|succeed the 3d transition series]], arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of +5 than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony, and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers.&lt;ref name=Greenwood552/&gt;

== Compounds ==
{{Category see also|Arsenic compounds}}

Compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of [[phosphorus]] which occupies the same [[Group (periodic table)|group]] (column) of the [[periodic table]]. The most common [[oxidation state]]s for arsenic are: −3 in the [[arsenide]]s, which are alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in the [[arsenite]]s, and +5 in the [[arsenates]] and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As{{su|b=4|p=3−}} ions in the mineral [[skutterudite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi = 10.1016/S0080-8784(01)80151-4 |title = Recent Trends in Thermoelectric Materials Research I: Skutterudites: Prospective novel thermoelectrics |date = 2001 |last1 = Uher |first1 = Ctirad |isbn = 978-0-12-752178-7 |volume = 69 |pages = 139–253| series = Semiconductors and Semimetals |chapter = Chapter 5 Skutterudites: Prospective novel thermoelectrics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the +3 [[oxidation state]], arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the [[lone pair]] of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--page 30--&gt;

=== Inorganic compounds ===

One of the simplest arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric [[arsine]] (AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300&amp;nbsp;°C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid.&lt;ref name=Greenwood557&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 557–8&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors, such as [[humidity]], presence of light and certain [[catalyst]]s (namely [[aluminium]]) facilitate the rate of decomposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;INRS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = Institut National de Recherche et de Sécurité |title = Fiche toxicologique nº 53: Trihydrure d'arsenic |year = 2000 |url = http://www.inrs.fr/inrs-pub/inrs01.nsf/IntranetObject-accesParReference/FT%2053/$File/ft53.pdf |accessdate = 2006-09-06 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061126045357/http://www.inrs.fr/inrs-pub/inrs01.nsf/IntranetObject-accesParReference/FT%2053/$FILE/ft53.pdf |archivedate = 26 November 2006 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]] instead of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood557/&gt;

Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline [[oxide]]s [[Arsenic trioxide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (&quot;[[white arsenic]]&quot;) and [[Arsenic pentoxide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] which are [[hygroscopic]] and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. [[Arsenic acid|Arsenic(V) acid]] is a weak acid and the salts are called [[arsenate]]s,&lt;ref name=Greenwood572/&gt; the most common [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include [[Scheele's Green]] (cupric hydrogen arsenate, acidic copper arsenate), [[calcium arsenate]], and [[lead hydrogen arsenate]]. These three have been used as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[insecticide]]s and [[poison]]s.

The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoric acid]]. Unlike [[phosphorous acid]], [[arsenous acid]] is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood572&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 572–8&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment ([[arsenic trisulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and realgar ([[tetraarsenic tetrasulfide|As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html|title=Arsenic: arsenic(II) sulfide compound data|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=WebElements.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071211100733/http://www.webelements.com/webelements/compounds/text/As/As4S4-12279902.html| archivedate= 11 December 2007|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both orpiment and realgar, as well as As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, have selenium analogs; the analogous As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the mineral [[kalgoorlieite]],&lt;ref&gt;

All trihalides of arsenic(III) are well known except the astatide, which is unknown. [[Arsenic pentafluoride]] (AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is the only important pentahalide, reflecting the lower stability of the +5 oxidation state; even so, it is a very strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent. (The [[Arsenic pentachloride|pentachloride]] is stable only below −50&amp;nbsp;°C, at which temperature it decomposes to the trichloride, releasing chlorine gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holl&quot; /&gt;)

Arsenic comprises about 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]&amp;nbsp;(0.00015%) of the [[Earth's crust]], and is the 53rd most abundant element. Typical background concentrations of arsenic do not exceed 3&amp;nbsp;ng/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the atmosphere; 100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in soil; and 10&amp;nbsp;μg/L in freshwater.

In 2014, China was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 70% world share, followed by [[Morocco]], [[Russia]], and [[Belgium]], according to the [[British Geological Survey]] and the [[United States Geological Survey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSCS2016&quot; /&gt; Most arsenic refinement operations in the US and Europe have closed over environmental concerns.

The word ''arsenic'' has its origin in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word {{lang|arc|ܠܐ ܙܐܦܢܝܐ}} ''(al) zarniqa'',&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline.com&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|arsenic|accessdate = 2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|زرنيخ}} ''zarnikh'', meaning &quot;yellow&quot; (literally &quot;gold-colored&quot;) and hence &quot;(yellow) [[orpiment]]&quot;. It was adopted into [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''arsenikon'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρσενικόν}}), a form that is [[folk etymology]], being the neuter form of the Greek word ''arsenikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρσενικός}}), meaning &quot;male&quot;, &quot;virile&quot;.

Two arsenic pigments have been widely used since their discovery – [[Paris Green]] and [[Scheele's Green]]. After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple was widely used. This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalbook.com/ProductChemicalPropertiesCB71248510_EN.htm &quot;London purple.

The toxicity of arsenic to [[insect]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]] led to its use as a wood preservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2134/jeq2004.0173 |last1 = Rahman |first1 = F.

An increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic led to a ban of CCA in consumer products in 2004, initiated by the [[European Union]] and United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Environmental Chemistry: Green Chemistry and Pollutants in Ecosystems|editor = Lichtfouse, Eric|editor2 = Schwarzbauer, Jan|editor3 = Robert, Didier|date = 2004|isbn = 978-3-540-22860-8|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=IDGLh_cWAIwC|chapter = Electrodialytical Removal of Cu, Cr and As from Threaded Wood|first = Eric|last = Lichtfouse |publisher = Springer|location = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;round&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Talanta|volume = 58|issue = 1|date = 2002|pages = 201–235|doi = 10.1016/S0039-9140(02)00268-0|title = Arsenic round the world: a review|first = Badal Kumar|last = Mandal|pmid = 18968746|last2 = Suzuki|first2 = K.

Arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides and poisons. For example, [[lead hydrogen arsenate]] was a common insecticide on [[fruit tree]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last = Peryea|first = F.

In the second half of the 20th century, [[monosodium methyl arsenate]] (MSMA) and [[disodium methyl arsenate]] (DSMA) – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – replaced lead arsenate in agriculture. These organic arsenicals were in turn phased out by 2013 in all agricultural activities except cotton farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reregistration/organic_arsenicals_fs.html |publisher = EPA |title = organic arsenicals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biogeochemistry of arsenic is complex and includes various adsorption and desorption processes. The toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by pH. Arsenite ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}}) is more soluble than arsenate ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) and is more toxic; however, at a lower pH, arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic. It was found that addition of sulfur, phosphorus, and iron oxides to high-arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Trace-Elements-in-Soils-and-Plants-Third-Edition/Kabata-Pendias/p/book/9780849315756|title=Trace Elements in Soils and Plants, Third Edition|website=CRC Press|access-date=2016-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821154852/https://www.crcpress.com/Trace-Elements-in-Soils-and-Plants-Third-Edition/Kabata-Pendias/p/book/9780849315756|archive-date=21 August 2016|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study of the remains of the [[Australia]]n racehorse, [[Phar Lap]], determined that the 1932 death of the famous champion was caused by a massive overdose of arsenic. Sydney veterinarian Percy Sykes stated, &quot;In those days, arsenic was quite a common tonic, usually given in the form of a solution (Fowler's Solution) ...

=== Medical use ===

During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines, including [[arsphenamine]] (by [[Paul Ehrlich]]) and [[arsenic trioxide]] (by [[Thomas Fowler (inventor)|Thomas Fowler]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ITOM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibaud |first1=Stéphane |last2=Jaouen |first2=Gérard |title=Arsenic – based drugs: from Fowler's solution to modern anticancer chemotherapy |date=2010 |volume=32 |pages=1–20 |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-13185-1_1 |series=Topics in Organometallic Chemistry |isbn=978-3-642-13184-4|bibcode=2010moc..book....1G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsphenamine, as well as [[neosalvarsan]], was indicated for [[syphilis]], but has been superseded by modern [[antibiotics]]. However, arsenicals such as [[melarsoprol]] are still used for the treatment of [[trypanosomiasis]], since although these drugs suffer from severe toxicity, the disease is almost uniformly fatal if untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 28673422 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31510-6 | volume=390 | issue=10110 | title=Human African trypanosomiasis | year=2017 | author=Büscher P, Cecchi G, Jamonneau V, Priotto G | journal=Lancet | pages=2397–2409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heredity ===

Arsenic has been linked to [[epigenetics|epigenetic changes]], heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in [[DNA sequence]]. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and [[RNA]] interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes [[p16 (gene)|p16]] and [[p53]], thus increasing risk of [[carcinogenesis]].

This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.

Another effective and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells 500&amp;nbsp;feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation. In this process, called ''adsorption'', arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo1283|title=Arsenic migration to deep groundwater in Bangladesh influenced by adsorption and water demand|date=2011|last1=Radloff|first1=K.

=== Redox transformation of arsenic in natural waters ===

Arsenic is unique among the trace [[metalloids]] and oxyanion-forming trace metals (e.g. As, Se, Sb, Mo, V, Cr, U, Re). It is sensitive to mobilization at pH values typical of natural waters (pH 6.5–8.5) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and +5), but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite [As(III)] or pentavalent arsenate [As(V)]. Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important. Organic arsenic compounds may, however, occur where waters are significantly impacted by industrial pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedley, P. L.|title=A review of the source, behaviour and distribution of arsenic in natural waters|doi=10.1016/S0883-2927(02)00018-5|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume =17| issue =5|year=2002|pages =517–568|bibcode=2002ApGC...17..517S|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/12311/1/Abstract.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenic may be solubilized by various processes. When pH is high, arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge. When water level drops and [[sulfide]] minerals are exposed to air, arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water. When organic carbon is present in water, bacteria are fed by directly reducing As(V) to As(III) or by reducing the element at the binding site, releasing inorganic arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110308104034/http://www.civil.umaine.edu/macrae/arsenic_gw.htm How Does Arsenic Get into the Groundwater]. Civil and Environmental Engineering. [[University of Maine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aquatic transformations of arsenic are affected by pH, reduction-oxidation potential, organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements, especially iron and manganese. The main factors are pH and the redox potential. Generally, the main forms of arsenic under oxic conditions are H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, HAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; at pH 2, 2–7, 7–11 and 11, respectively. Under reducing conditions, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is predominant at pH 2–9.

Oxidation and reduction affects the migration of arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the [[adsorption]] of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Zhaohua, Zhang Zhiliang (2002). &quot;The formation of As element in groundwater and the controlling factor&quot;. Shanghai Geology 87 (3): 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water. Arsenic can [[precipitate]] when metal sulfides form. In this way, arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases. When oxygen is present, bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energy, potentially releasing bound arsenic.

Redox reactions involving Fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems. The reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of arsenic to water. So arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated Fe concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Redox control of arsenic mobilization in Bangladesh groundwater|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2003.09.007 |volume=19 |issue=2 |journal=Applied Geochemistry|pages=201–214|bibcode=2004ApGC...19..201Z|year=2004 |last1=Zheng |first1=Y |last2=Stute |first2=M |last3=Van Geen |first3=A |last4=Gavrieli |first4=I |last5=Dhar |first5=R |last6=Simpson |first6=H.J |last7=Schlosser |first7=P |last8=Ahmed |first8=K.M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from [[pyrite]] or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. Under reducing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly. The other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Mary Ann (2007). [http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5036/pdf/sir20075036_web.pdf &quot;The Association of Arsenic With Redox Conditions, Depth, and Ground-Water Age in the Glacial Aquifer System of the Northern United States&quot;]. U.S. Geological Survey, Virginia. pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of bacteria catalyze redox transformations of arsenic. Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes (DARP) speed up the reduction of As(V) to As(III). DARP use As(V) as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process. [[Chemoautotrophic]] arsenite oxidizers (CAO) and [[heterotrophic]] arsenite oxidizers (HAO) convert As(III) into As(V). CAO combine the oxidation of As(III) with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. HAO cannot obtain energy from As(III) oxidation. This process may be an arsenic [[detoxification]] mechanism for the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bin, Hong |year=2006|title=Influence of microbes on biogeochemistry of arsenic mechanism of arsenic mobilization in groundwater|journal= Advances in Earth Science |volume=21 |issue=1|pages= 77–82|url=http://www.adearth.ac.cn/EN/abstract/abstract3466.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equilibrium thermodynamic calculations predict that As(V) concentrations should be greater than As(III) concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; reduction is occurring. However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As(III) by dissolved O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a particularly slow reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson (1975) gave [[Half-life|half-lives]] for the oxygenation of As(III) in seawater ranging from several months to a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00139307509437429|pmid=236901 |title=The oxidation of arsenite in seawater |volume=8 |issue=2 |journal=Environmental Letters|pages=157–171|year=1975 |last1=Johnson |first1=D. L |last2=Pilson |first2=M. E. Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other studies, As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cherry, J.

Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concerning to the general public. The vast majority of older [[Timber treatment|pressure-treated]] wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor [[building material]]. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding [[soil]] (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber.

One tool that maps the location (and other information) of arsenic releases in the United State is [[TOXMAP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/toxmap/tri/mapIt.do?chemicalName=arsenic |title=TRI Releases Map |publisher=Toxmap.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-03-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100320154547/http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/toxmap/tri/mapIt.do?chemicalName=arsenic |archivedate=20 March 2010 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) funded by the US Federal Government. With marked-up maps of the United States, TOXMAP enables users to visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/ TOXNET – Databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases]. Toxnet.nlm.nih.gov. Retrieved 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

=== Bioremediation ===

Physical, chemical, and biological methods have been used to remediate arsenic contaminated water.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEM-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jain |first=C. K. |last2=Singh |first2=R. D. |title=Technological options for the removal of arsenic with special reference to South East Asia |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.04.016 |date=2012 |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=107 |pages=1–8 |pmid=22579769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioremediation is said to be cost-effective and environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11270-013-1722-y |title = Bioremediation of arsenic-contaminated water: recent advances and future prospects |date = 2013 |last1 = Goering |first1 = P. |journal = Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |volume = 224 |issue = 12 |page=1722| bibcode = 2013WASP..224.1722B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.10.014| pmid = 25464303 |title = Anaerobic arsenite oxidation with an electrode serving as the sole electron acceptor: A novel approach to the bioremediation of arsenic-polluted groundwater. |date = 2015 |last1 = Goering |first1 = P. |journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume = 283 |pages = 617–622| hdl = 10256/11522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via [[phytoremediation]] but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.

Bioremediation requires careful evaluation and design in accordance with existing conditions. Some sites may require the addition of an electron acceptor while others require microbe supplementation ([[bioaugmentation]]). Regardless of the method used, only constant monitoring can prevent future contamination.

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons.

=== Classification ===

Elemental arsenic and arsenic sulfate and trioxide compounds are classified as &quot;[[toxicity|toxic]]&quot; and &quot;dangerous for the environment&quot; in the [[European Union]] under [[directive 67/548/EEC]].
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-001-00-X (arsenic) R23/25-50/53; S1/2-20/21-28-45-60-61 --&gt;
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-002-00-5 (other compounds) pareil --&gt;The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) recognizes arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogens]], and the EU lists arsenic trioxide, [[arsenic pentoxide]], and [[arsenate]] salts as category 1 [[carcinogen]]s.

Arsenic is known to cause [[Arsenic poisoning#Arsenicosis: chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking water|arsenicosis]] when present in drinking water, &quot;the most common species being arsenate [{{chem|HAsO|4|2-}}; As(V)] and arsenite [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; As(III)]&quot;.

=== Legal limits, food, and drink ===

In the United States since 2006, the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is 10 ppb&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/arsenic/regulations.cfm Arsenic Rule]. U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Adopted 22 January 2001; effective 23 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the FDA set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda_metals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ChemicalContaminantsMetalsNaturalToxinsPesticides/ucm360023.htm |title=Supporting Document for Action Level for Arsenic in Apple Juice |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foodsafetynews&quot; /&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}} The Department of Environmental Protection for New Jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/dsr/arsenic/guide.htm |title=A Homeowner's Guide to Arsenic in Drinking Water |publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (5 ppb). The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) to a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.01 ppb), and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set the [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) to a 15-minute constant exposure of 0.002&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.002 ppb).&lt;ref name=PGCH&gt;{{PGCH|0038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEL for organic arsenic compounds is a TWA of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; (0.5 ppb).

In 2008, based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of American foods for toxic chemicals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm Total Diet Study] and [https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/ChemicalContaminants/ucm2006907.htm Toxic Elements Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] set the &quot;level of concern&quot; for inorganic arsenic in apple and pear juices at 23 ppb, based on non-carcinogenic effects, and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level; it also required recalls for non-conforming domestic products.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda_metals&quot; /&gt; In 2011, the national ''[[Dr. Oz]]'' television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers. Though the methodology was disputed (it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic) the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kotz, Deborah |url=http://www.boston.com/community/moms/articles/2011/09/14/does_apple_juice_have_unsafe_levels_of_arsenic/ |title=Does apple juice have unsafe levels of arsenic? – The Boston Globe |newspaper=Boston.com |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, FDA tested the worst brand from the ''Dr.'' ''Oz'' show and found much lower levels. Ongoing testing found 95% of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern. Later testing by [[Consumer Reports]] showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb, and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerist.com/2011/11/30/consumer-reports-study-finds-high-levels-of-arsenic-lead-in-apple-juice/|title=Consumer Reports Study Finds High Levels Of Arsenic &amp; Lead In Some Fruit Juice|author=Morran, Chris |publisher=consumerist.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, on consideration of consumption by children, chronic exposure, and carcinogenic effect, the FDA established an &quot;action level&quot; of 10 ppb for apple juice, the same as the drinking water standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda_metals&quot; /&gt;

Concern about arsenic in rice in Bangladesh was raised in 2002, but at the time only Australia had a legal limit for food (one milligram per kilogram).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2002/021122/full/news021118-11.html |title=Arsenic contamination of Bangladeshi paddy field soils: implications for rice contribution to arsenic consumption : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3141-tainted-wells-pour-arsenic-onto-food-crops.html#.UhPasx-37Vs |title=Tainted wells pour arsenic onto food crops |magazine=New Scientist |date=6 December 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern was raised about people who were eating U.S. rice exceeding WHO standards for personal arsenic intake in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peplow, Mark |doi=10.1038/news050801-5 |title=US rice may carry an arsenic burden |journal= Nature News|date=2 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the People's Republic of China set a food standard of 150 ppb for arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-rice-source-arsenic-exposure.html |title = Rice as a source of arsenic exposure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in 2012, testing by separate groups of researchers at the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at [[Dartmouth College]] (early in the year, focusing on urinary levels in children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205014/ |title=EHP – Rice Consumption and Urinary Arsenic Concentrations in U.S. Children |publisher=Ehp.niehs.nih.gov |accessdate=2013-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112184148/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1205014/ |archive-date=12 November 2014 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Consumer Reports]] (in November)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/02/147781035/high-levels-of-arsenic-found-in-rice |title=High Levels Of Arsenic Found In Rice |publisher=NPR |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cr_rice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm |title=Arsenic in Your Food &amp;#124; Consumer Reports Investigation |publisher=Consumerreports.org |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the FDA to set limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;foodsafetynews&quot;&gt;[http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/02/lawmakers-urge-fda-to-act-on-arsenic-standards/ Lawmakers Urge FDA to Act on Arsenic Standards].

Consumer Reports recommended: 
# That the EPA and FDA eliminate arsenic-containing fertilizer, drugs, and pesticides in food production;
# That the FDA establish a legal limit for food;
# That industry change production practices to lower arsenic levels, especially in food for children; and
# That consumers test home water supplies, eat a varied diet, and cook rice with excess water, then draining it off (reducing inorganic arsenic by about one third along with a slight reduction in vitamin content).&lt;ref name=&quot;cr_rice&quot; /&gt;

=== Ecotoxicity ===

Arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms, marine species in particular, but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs. In polluted areas, plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate, which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells. In polluted areas, uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion (found more particularly in reducing conditions) is likely in poorly-drained soils.

=== Biological mechanism ===

Arsenic's toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for [[thiol]]s. Thiols, in the form of [[cysteine]] residues and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[lipoic acid]] and [[coenzyme A]], are situated at the active sites of many important [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;

Arsenic disrupts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through several mechanisms. At the level of the [[citric acid cycle]], arsenic inhibits [[lipoic acid]], which is a cofactor for [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]. By competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]], mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system [[organ failure]]. The organ failure is presumed to be from [[necrotic]] cell death, not [[apoptosis]], since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0378-4274(02)00084-X |title = Arsenic toxicity and potential mechanisms of action |date = 2002 |last1 = Hughes |first1 = Michael F. |journal = Toxicology Letters |volume = 133 |pages = 1–16 |pmid = 12076506 |issue = 1| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1260065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposure risks and remediation ===

Occupational exposure and [[arsenic poisoning]] may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The conversion between As(III) and As(V) is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, &quot;[the] understanding [of] what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for [[bioremediation]] of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Genetics of Geochemisty|journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=38 |date=2004 |pages=175–206|pmid=15568975 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.38.072902.091138|last1=Croal|first1=Laura R. |last2=Gralnick |first2=Jeffrey A. |last3=Malasarn |first3=Davin |last4=Newman |first4=Dianne K.|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/286/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===

Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible. British anti-lewisite ([[dimercaprol]]) is prescribed in doses of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg up to 300&amp;nbsp;mg every 4&amp;nbsp;hours for the first day, then every 6&amp;nbsp;hours for the second day, and finally every 8&amp;nbsp;hours for 8 additional days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giannini, A.
