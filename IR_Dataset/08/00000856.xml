Apple was founded by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], and [[Ronald Wayne]] in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,&lt;ref name=&quot;wozemployee&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rice19850415&quot; /&gt;

As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company—reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm, but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.

Apple is well known for its size and revenues. Its worldwide annual revenue totaled $265&amp;nbsp;billion for the 2018 [[fiscal year]]. Apple is the [[list of the largest information technology companies|world's largest technology company]] by revenue and one of the [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|world's most valuable companies]]. It is also the world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after [[Samsung]] and [[Huawei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/01/huawei-beats-apple-smartphone-manufacturer-samsung-iphone|title=Huawei beats Apple to become second-largest smartphone maker|last=|first=|date=August 3, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 3, 2018 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Apple became the first public U.S. company to be valued at over $1&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref name=&quot;1t-CNBC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1t-Guardian&quot; /&gt; The company employs 123,000 full-time employees&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-Inc-Nov-2017-10-K&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2624/32019317000070/filing-main.htm |title=Apple Inc, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Nov 3, 2017 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date= April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains 504 [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in 24 countries {{As of|2018|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/|title=Apple Retail Store – Store List |publisher= Apple |language= en-US |access-date= August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. {{As of|2018|1}}, more than 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/01/apple-now-has-1-3-billion-active-devices-worldwide/ |title= Apple Now Has 1.3 Billion Active Devices Worldwide |access-date= August 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also has a high level of [[brand loyalty]] and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand. However, Apple [[criticism of Apple Inc.|receives significant criticism]] regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices and unethical business practices, including [[anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]], as well as the origins of source materials.

[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|The [[Macintosh Portable]], released in 1989, is Apple's first battery-powered portable Macintosh personal computer.]]
After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called &quot;high-right policy&quot; named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1,000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gassée's mantra of &quot;fifty-five or die&quot;, referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].&lt;ref name=insidestoryCarlton&gt;{{Cite book |last= Carlton |first= Jim |year= 1997 |title= Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders |location= New York |publisher= [[Random House]] |isbn= 978-0-8129-2851-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/appleinsidestory00carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|79–80}} Selling Macintosh at such high profit margins was only possible because of its dominant position in the desktop publishing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Swaine|2014}}|first=Michael |last=Swaine |year=2014 |title=Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer |publisher=Pragmatic Bookshelf |isbn=9781680503524}} pp. 359–363&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 is the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.&lt;ref name=insidestoryCarlton /&gt;{{Rp|117–129}} During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing [[Michael Spindler]] as the [[chief operating officer]].{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=184–185}} Gassée left the company later that year.{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=160}} In October 1990, Apple introduced three lower-cost models, the [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC]], and [[Macintosh IIsi]],{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=128}} all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.

In 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the &quot;luggable&quot; [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the [[Classic Mac OS]]. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |first=Thomas |last=Hormby |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html |title=Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years |website=[[Low End Mac]] |date=February 22, 2006 |access-date=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of their higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], the mid-range [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, and the consumer-marketed [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Macintosh Performa |url= http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130419164519/http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |publisher=Vectronics Apple World |access-date=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [[Apple QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Apple Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], the [[eWorld]] online service, and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]].

By the late 1980s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to System 6, such as [[A/UX]] and [[Taligent#Pink|Pink]]. The System 6 platform itself was outdated because it was not originally built for multitasking. By the 1990s, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. System 6 and 7 would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on modern hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall |access-date=August 14, 2008 |work=Roughly Drafted |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range= |title=Power Macintosh 6100 |access-date=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without [[digital rights management]] (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first= Ryan |last= Block |authorlink= Ryan Block |title= A letter from Steve Jobs on DRM: let's get rid of it |url= https://www.engadget.com/2007/02/06/a-letter-from-steve-jobs-on-drm-lets-get-rid-of-it/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date= February 6, 2007 |access-date= March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2007, Apple and [[EMI]] jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.macworld.com/article/57098/2007/04/drmfree.html |title= Apple, EMI offer higher-quality DRM free downloads |website=[[Macworld]] |date= April 2, 2007 |access-date= November 29, 2010 |last= Dalrymple |first= Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their [[FairPlay]] DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Changes Coming to the iTunes Store |url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/06Changes-Coming-to-the-iTunes-Store/ |publisher= Apple Inc. |access-date= March 23, 2014 |date= January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would attend the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance, and that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing [[Phil Schiller]] would deliver the 2009 keynote address in lieu of the expected Jobs. The official press release explained that Apple was &quot;scaling back&quot; on trade shows in general, including [[Macworld Tokyo]] and the [[Apple Expo]] in [[Paris]], France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Chunkier Sidekick to Replace Jobs at Macworld |url= http://doeswhat.com/2008/12/16/chunkier-sidekick-to-replace-jobs-at-macworld/ |publisher= DoesWhat |access-date= March 23, 2014 |date= December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title= Apple Announces Its Last Year at Macworld |url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/12/16Apple-Announces-Its-Last-Year-at-Macworld/ |publisher= Apple Inc. |access-date= March 23, 2014 |date= December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical [[leave of absence]] from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that &quot;the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well&quot;, and explained that the break would allow the company &quot;to focus on delivering extraordinary products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title= Apple Media Advisory |url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/14Apple-Media-Advisory/ |publisher= Apple Inc. |access-date= March 23, 2014 |first= Steve |last= Jobs |authorlink= Steve Jobs |date= January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the [[late-2000s recession|recession]] with revenue of $8.16&amp;nbsp;billion and profit of $1.21&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-Inc-Apr-2009-10-Q&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2508/119312509085781/filing-main.htm |title=Apple Inc, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Apr 23, 2009 |publisher= secdatabase.com |access-date= March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.betanews.com/article/Apple-reports-the-best-nonholiday-quarter-in-its-history/1240433273 |title= Apple reports the best non-holiday quarter in its history |publisher=[[Betanews]] |date= April 22, 2009 |access-date= November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of speculation and multiple rumored &quot;leaks&quot;, Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the [[iPad]] on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ipad/apple-ipad-reaches-1-million-sales-faster-than-iphone-idUSTRE64002T20100503 |title= Apple iPad reaches 1 million sales faster than iPhone |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date= September 10, 2018 |language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm |title= Apple passes Microsoft to be biggest tech company |date= May 27, 2010 |access-date= May 29, 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529063247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm |archivedate= May 29, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer [[Jonathan Ive]] used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |text=We don't take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminum... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters.

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (Jobs accidentally referred to the device as &quot;iTV&quot;, its codename, while on stage), a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url= https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher= Apple Inc. |date= September 12, 2006 |access-date= October 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515000953/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |archivedate= May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device, running a variant of Mac OS X, links up to a user's TV and syncs over the wireless or wired network with one computer's iTunes library and can stream content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref name=&quot;living Room&quot; /&gt; On May 30, 2007, a 160&amp;nbsp;GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/05/30YouTube-Coming-to-Apple-TV/ |title= YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher= Apple Inc. |date= May 30, 2007 |access-date= October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/01/15Apple-Introduces-New-Apple-TV-Software-Lowers-Price-to-229/ |title= Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher= Apple Inc. |date= January 15, 2008 |access-date= October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40&amp;nbsp;GB Apple TV but continued to produce and sell the 160&amp;nbsp;GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV running on an iOS variant and discontinued the older model, which ran on a Mac OS X variant. The new device is one-fourth the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8&amp;nbsp;GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] downloaded media. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor.

It has HDMI out as the only video output source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]], and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a subsequent variant of iOS called [[tvOS]], and contains 32&amp;nbsp;GB or 64&amp;nbsp;GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new [[Siri Remote]] with a glass [[touchpad]], [[gyroscope]], and [[microphone]].

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name &quot;Apple&quot; was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html |access-date=October 21, 2011 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by [[Ron Wayne]], depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archive.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597 |title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion |date=September 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=ZLOK|title=¥ves ฿ennaïm 🌿 (@ZLOK) on Twitter|website=twitter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo |title=Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo |first=Ivan |last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt; This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to [[Alan Turing#Death|his method of suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |access-date=September 14, 2009 |date=January 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |archivedate=October 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff |date=March 14, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Leavitt |first=David |title=The Man Who Knew Too Much; Alan Turing and the invention of the computer |year=2007 |page=280 |location=Phoenix |isbn=978-0-7538-2200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.

Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the [[American Dream]]. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.}}

Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (advertisement)|&quot;1984&quot;]] television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Deutschman |first=Alan |title=The once and future Steve Jobs |url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |website=[[Salon.com]] |access-date=November 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup |title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than projects with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple |title=What It's Like To Work At Apple |website=[[Cult of Mac]] |first=John |last=Brownlee |date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

At Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having &quot;best-in-class&quot; employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |access-date=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a &quot;directly responsible individual&quot; or &quot;DRI&quot; in Apple jargon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune1&quot; /&gt; As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Apple Maps|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |title=Inside Apple's major shakeup |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=October 29, 2012 |access-date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906 |title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011 |date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Apple had 110,000&amp;nbsp;full-time employees. This increased to 116,000&amp;nbsp;full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline.

==== Lack of innovation ====
An editorial article in ''[[The Verge]]'' in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has &quot;matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design&quot; and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating &quot;Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success&quot;. He acknowledges that people are wishing for the &quot;excitement of revolution&quot;, but argues that people want &quot;the comfort that comes with harmony&quot;. Furthermore, he writes that &quot;a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned&quot;, referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Thomas |last=Ricker |title=First Click: Apple's greatest innovation is its ecosystem |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 7, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in June 2017 that Apple's increased reliance on [[Siri]], its [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual personal assistant]], has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality. Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. &quot;Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley&quot;, Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Tripp |last=Mickle |title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'—How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, two articles from ''The Verge'' and ''[[ZDNet]]'' debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apple's macOS and iOS software platforms. The former had experienced a severe security vulnerability, in which Macs running the then-latest [[macOS High Sierra]] software were vulnerable to a bug that let anyone gain administrator privileges by entering &quot;root&quot; as the username in system prompts, leaving the password field empty and twice clicking &quot;unlock&quot;, gaining full access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=Anyone can hack macOS High Sierra just by typing &quot;root&quot; |url=https://www.wired.com/story/macos-high-sierra-hack-root/ |journal=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=November 28, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bug was publicly disclosed on [[Twitter]], rather than through proper [[bug bounty program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Major Apple security flaw grants admin access on macOS High Sierra without password |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/28/16711782/apple-macos-high-sierra-critical-password-security-flaw |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 28, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple released a security fix within a day and issued an apology, stating that &quot;regrettably we stumbled&quot; in regards to the security of the latest updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple Releases macOS High Sierra Security Update to Fix Root Password Vulnerability |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/29/apple-fixes-root-password-bug-security-update/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 29, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After installing the security patch, however, file sharing was broken for users, with Apple releasing a support document with instructions to separately fix that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple releases update to fix critical macOS High Sierra security issue |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/29/16715246/apple-releases-high-sierra-root-security-patch |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 29, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Apple publicly stated the promise of &quot;auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again&quot;, users who installed the security update while running the older 10.13.0 version of the High Sierra operating system rather than the then-newest 10.13.1 release experienced that the &quot;root&quot; security vulnerability was re-introduced, and persisted even after fully updating their systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=macOS update accidentally undoes Apple's &quot;root&quot; bug patch |url=https://www.wired.com/story/macos-update-undoes-apple-root-bug-patch/ |journal=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |date=December 1, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On iOS, a date bug caused iOS devices that received local app notifications at 12:15am on December 2, 2017 to repeatedly restart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Date Bug in iOS 11.1.2 Causing Crash Loop on iPhones as December 2 Hits [Updated] |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/02/ios-11-1-2-date-bug-crash-loop/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 1, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users were recommended to turn off notifications for their apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Rene |last=Ritchie |title=iPhone crashing on Dec. 2?

Not to say that things didn't go wrong under his watch, but product announcements and launches felt a lot tighter for sure, as did the overall quality of what Apple was releasing.&quot; He did, however, also acknowledge that such failures &quot;may indeed have happened&quot; with Jobs in charge, though returning to the previous praise for his demands of quality, stating &quot;it's almost guaranteed that given his personality that heads would have rolled, which limits future failures&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet rotten&quot; /&gt;

=== Manufacturing ===
The company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: &quot;Nobody wants to buy sour milk&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;supply&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |access-date=December 24, 2011|date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |access-date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as [[USB]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[NVM Express|NVMe]], [[PCI Express|PCIe]] and others in its products. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]] and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152533/http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |archivedate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO [[Tim Cook]] said that he &quot;[loves] India&quot;, but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Apple's Feeling Europe's Economic Crisis: 'Essentially Flat' Sales And A 'Slowdown' In Business, Says Cook |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/apples-feeling-europes-economic-crisis-essentially-flat-revenues/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 24, 2012 |access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as &quot;really adds cost to getting product to market&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'I love India, but...' |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-india-but-247307 |website=Gadgets360 |publisher=[[NDTV]] |date=July 25, 2012 |access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Indian Apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and [[store-within-a-store]] concepts, in an effort to expand further into the market.

The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [[outsourcing]] initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by ''The New York Times'', Apple insiders &quot;believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that &quot;Made in the U.S.A.&quot; is no longer a viable option for most Apple products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |first1=Charles |last1=Duhigg |first2=Keith |last2=Bradsher |title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class |date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huff&quot; /&gt; Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot; /&gt;

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: &quot;We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 19, 2014 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks.

Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from [[post-consumer]] [[recycle]]d paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2015.pdf |title= Apple Environmental Responsibility Report (2015) |date= |publisher= Apple Inc. |access-date= March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2016.pdf |title= Apple Environmental Responsibility Report 2016 Progress Report, Covering Fiscal Year 2015 |date= |publisher= Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple working in partnership with [[The Conservation Fund|Conservation Fund]], have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in [[Maine]] and [[North Carolina]]. Another partnership announced is with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] to preserve up to {{convert|1,000,000|acre|km2}} of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Solar power|solar power plant]] in the [[Sichuan]] province of [[China]] that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country.

{{Further|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Tax practices|EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|Leprechaun economics}}
Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the &quot;[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]],&quot; which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Duhigg |first1=Charles |last2=Kocieniewski |first2=David |title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2012 |date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Watson |first= Roland |title= Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax' |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date= October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Ebrahimi |first= Helia |title= Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date= November 2, 2012 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple Inc. claims to be the single largest taxpayer to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] with an [[tax rate|effective tax rate]] of approximately of 26% as of the second quarter of the Apple [[fiscal year]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://investor.apple.com |title= Investor Relations |publisher= Apple Inc. |access-date= April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017, Tim Cook stated, that Apple is the biggest taxpayer worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.faz.net/1.5245252|title=Tim Cook im Interview: &quot;Hoffentlich seid ihr Deutschen richtig stolz auf euch&quot; |first= Carsten |last= Knop |date= November 14, 2017 |access-date= March 26, 2019 |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Reuters]] reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4&amp;nbsp;billion which were untaxed by the [[IRS]] of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code|IRC]], corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its [[shareholder]]s it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Drawbaugh |first1=Kevin |last2=Temple-West |first2=Patrick |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409 |title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/ |title=Apple Earnings Call |publisher=Apple Inc. |access-date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2016 the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office of Ireland]] announced that 2015 Irish [[GDP]] had grown by 26.3%, and 2015 Irish [[GNP]] had grown by 18.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/nie/nationalincomeandexpenditureannualresults2015/ |title= National Income and Expenditure Annual Results 2015 |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics]] |date= July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures attracted international scorn, and were labelled by Nobel-prize winning economist, [[Paul Krugman]], as [[leprechaun economics]]. It was not until 2018 that Irish economists could definitively prove that the 2015 growth was due to Apple restructuring its controversial [[double Irish]] subsidiaries (Apple Sales International), which Apple converted into a new Irish [[corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes|capital allowances for intangible assets]] tax scheme (expires in January 2020). The affair required the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] to create a new measure of Irish economic growth, [[modified gross national income|Modified GNI*]] to replace Irish GDP, given the distortion of Apple's tax schemes. Irish GDP is 143% of Irish Modified GNI*.

On August 30, 2016, after [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|a two-year investigation]], the EU Competition Commissioner concluded Apple received &quot;illegal State aid&quot; from Ireland. The EU ordered Apple to pay 13&amp;nbsp;billion euros ($14.5&amp;nbsp;billion), plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes for 2004–2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple 13 billion euros&quot;&gt;Kanter, James and Scott, Mark (August 30, 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html Apple Must Pay Billions for Tax Breaks in Ireland, E.U.

=== Litigation ===
{{Main|Apple Inc. litigation}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Federal Court Cases Involving Apple, Inc |url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/AllNaturesOfSuit/Apple%2C%20Inc./ |publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc. |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]'', ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'', ''[[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.]]'', and ''[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]''. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights.

In June 2019, Apple issued a recall for its 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 15&quot; affecting 432,000 units after reports of batteries catching fire.

In July 2019, following a campaign by the &quot;[[Electronics right to repair|right to repair]]&quot; movement, challenging Apple's tech repair restrictions on devices, the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] held a workshop to establish the framework of a future nationwide Right to Repair rule.

In January 2020, US President [[Donald Trump]] slammed Apple for refusing to unlock two [[iPhones]] of a Saudi national,  Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, who shot and killed three American sailors and injured eight others in the [[Naval air station|Naval air base]].
