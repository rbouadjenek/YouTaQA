It has the highest [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|sociolinguistic prestige]] locally, as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations. In less formal situations, Austrians tend to use forms closer to or identical with the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] and [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]], traditionally spoken – but rarely written – in Austria.

==History==
Austrian German has its beginning in the mid-18th century, when empress [[Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] introduced [[compulsory education|compulsory schooling]] (in 1774) and several reforms of administration in their multilingual [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg empire]]. At the time, the written standard was ''Oberdeutsche Schreibsprache'', which was highly influenced by the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] and [[Alemannic dialects]] of Austria. Another option was to create a new standard based on the Southern German dialects, as proposed by the linguist [[Johann Siegmund Popowitsch]]. Instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already standardized Chancellery language of Saxony (''Sächsische Kanzleisprache'' or ''Meißner Kanzleideutsch''), which was based on the administrative language of the non-Austrian area of [[Meißen]] and [[Dresden]].
Thus Standard Austrian German has the same geographic origin as the [[German Standard German]] (''Bundesdeutsches Hochdeutsch'') and [[Swiss High German]] (''Schweizer Hochdeutsch'', not to be confused with the Alemannic [[Swiss German]] dialects).

The process of introducing the new written standard was led by [[Joseph von Sonnenfels]].
Since 1951 the standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools has been defined by the ''[[Austrian Dictionary]]'' (''{{lang|de|Österreichisches Wörterbuch}}''), published under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]].

==General situation of German==
As [[German language|German]] is a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian German is one among several [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Standard German. Much like the relationship between [[British English]] and [[American English]], the German varieties differ in minor respects (e.g., spelling, word usage and grammar) but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible.

==Standard German in Austria==
The official Austrian dictionary, ''[[das Österreichische Wörterbuch]]'', [[linguistic prescription|prescribe]]s grammatical and spelling rules defining the official language. 

Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the [[German orthography reform of 1996#In Austria|German spelling reform]] of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996.

The &quot;[[sharp s]]&quot; (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany.

[[File:1995_Schulschrift_2._Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|«Schulschrift 1995», one of Austria's primary school handwriting programs]]
[[Image:Fußgeher-Schild.JPG|thumb|A street sign in Vienna: ''{{lang|de|Fußgeher}}'' (&quot;pedestrian&quot;) is normally ''{{lang|de|Fußgänger}}'' in Germany. [[Capital ẞ]] instead of ''SS'' when a word is written in all-caps was incorporated into the spelling standard of both countries in 2017, although the use of ''SS'' is still correct.]]
Because of the German language's [[pluricentric language|pluricentric]] nature, German dialects in Austria should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. 

Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[administration (government)|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in ''Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie'' (Peter Lang, 2006).

===Former spoken standard===
The former standard, used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language, was the ''{{lang|de|Schönbrunner Deutsch}}'', a sociolect spoken by the imperial [[Habsburg family]] and the nobility of [[Austria-Hungary]]. It differed from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation; it appears to have been spoken with a slight degree of nasality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} This was not a standard in a modern technical sense, as it was just the social standard of upper-class speech.&lt;ref&gt;Here are some examples of ''{{lang|de|Schönbrunner Deutsch}}'':
*[[Otto von Habsburg]] (2004), former crown prince: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEIHAl01GP4 Otto von Habsburg – Quo vadis Integration – Festvortrag Eggenberg]
*Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] (1916–1918): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMU9FFzez1A Recording] (1.5 min)
*Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] (1848–1916): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jecUwMPk8pE Recording of a speech for a military fund] (30 sec)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special written forms===
For many years, Austria had a special form of the language for official government documents. This form is known as ''{{lang|de|Österreichische Kanzleisprache}}'', or &quot;Austrian chancellery language&quot;. It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from medieval deeds and documents, and has a very complex structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents. For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic, internal, official, and military matters. There are no regional variations, because this special written form has mainly been used by a government that has now for centuries been based in Vienna.

''{{lang|de|Österreichische Kanzleisprache}}'' is now used less and less, thanks to various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants (''{{lang|de|[[Beamter|Beamte]]}}''). As a result, Standard German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.

===European Union===
When Austria became a member of the [[European Union]], 23 food-related terms were listed in its accession agreement as having the same legal status as the equivalent terms used in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:1994:241:TOC |title= Documents concerning the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Norway to the European Union |accessdate= 24 October 2015 |date= 29 August 1994 |work= European Commission |page= 370 |quote= The specific Austrian terms of the German language contained in the Austrian legal order and listed in the Annex to this Protocol shall have the same status and may be used with the same legal effect as the corresponding terms used in Germany listed in that Annex.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian German is the only variety of a [[pluricentric language]] recognized under international law or EU primary law.&lt;ref&gt;Markhardt's ''Das österreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU'', Peter Lang, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===

====Verbs====
In [[Austria]], as in the [[languages of Switzerland#German|German-speaking parts of Switzerland]] and in [[southern Germany]], verbs that express a state tend to use ''{{lang|de|sein}}'' as the [[auxiliary verb]] in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], as well as verbs of movement. [[Verb]]s which fall into this category include ''sitzen'' (to sit), ''liegen'' (to lie) and, in parts of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], ''schlafen'' (to sleep). Therefore, the perfect of these verbs would be ''ich bin gesessen'', ''ich bin gelegen'' and ''ich bin geschlafen'' respectively (note: ''ich bin geschlafen'' is a rarely used form, more commonly ''ich habe geschlafen'' is used).

In Germany, the words ''stehen'' (to stand) and ''gestehen'' (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: ''habe gestanden''. The Austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity (''bin gestanden'' from ''stehen'', &quot;to stand&quot;; and ''habe gestanden'' from ''gestehen'', &quot;to confess&quot;, e.g. ''&quot;der Verbrecher ist vor dem Richter gestanden und hat gestanden&quot;'').

In addition, the [[preterite]] ([[simple past]]) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the [[spoken language]], with the exception of some modal verbs (i.e. ''ich sollte'', ''ich wollte'').

===Vocabulary===
There are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of [[Germany]]. Words used in Austria are ''Jänner'' (January) rather than ''Januar'', ''Feber'' (seldom, February) along with ''Februar'', ''heuer'' (this year) along with ''dieses Jahr'', ''Stiege'' (stairs) along with ''Treppen'', ''Rauchfang'' (chimney) instead of ''Schornstein'', many administrative, legal and political terms, and many food terms, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;Otto Back, Erich Benedikt, Karl Blüml, et al.: Österreichisches Wörterbuch (neue Rechtschreibung).

There are, however, some [[false friends]] between the two regional varieties:
*''Kasten'' (wardrobe) along with or instead of ''Schrank'' (and, similarly, ''Eiskasten'' along with ''Kühlschrank'', fridge), as opposed to ''Kiste'' (box) instead of ''Kasten''. ''Kiste'' in Germany means both &quot;box&quot; and &quot;chest&quot;.
*''Sessel'' (chair) instead of ''Stuhl''. ''Sessel'' means &quot;[[easy chair]]&quot; in Germany and ''Stuhl'' means &quot;stool (faeces)&quot; in both varieties.

==Dialects==

===Classification===
*Dialects of the [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian group]], which also comprises the dialects of German [[Bavaria]]
**[[Central Austro-Bavarian]] (along the main rivers [[Isar]] and [[Danube]], spoken in the northern parts of the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], and northern [[Burgenland]])
***[[Viennese German]]
**[[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] (in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland)
*[[Vorarlbergerisch]], spoken in [[Vorarlberg]], is a [[High Alemannic]] dialect.

===Regional accents===
In addition to the standard variety, in everyday life most Austrians speak one of a number of [[Upper German dialects]].

While strong forms of the various dialects are not fully [[mutually intelligible]] to [[northern Germany|northern Germans]], communication is much easier in [[Bavaria]], especially rural areas, where the Bavarian dialect still predominates as the mother tongue. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of [[Standard German]] than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].

[[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is seen for many in Germany as quintessentially Austrian. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and, after listening to a few spoken words, it may be possible for an Austrian to realise which [[dialect]] is being spoken. However, in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], other Tyroleans are often unable to understand them. Speakers from the different [[states of Austria]] can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener.

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today [[Czechia]]. The German dialects of [[South Tyrol]] have been influenced by local [[Romance languages]], particularly noticeable with the many [[loanword]]s from [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Ladin language|Ladin]].

The geographic borderlines between the different accents ([[isogloss]]es) coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the linguistic similarities.
