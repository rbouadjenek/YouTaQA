{{Infobox antimony}}
'''Antimony''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&amp;nbsp;'''Sb''' (from {{lang-la|stibium}}) and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;51. A lustrous gray [[metalloid]], it is found in nature mainly as the [[sulfide mineral]] [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kimhi]]'s Commentary on Jeremiah 4:30 and I Chronicles 29:2; Hebrew: '''פוך'''/'''כְּחֻל''', Aramaic: '''כּוּחְלִי'''/'''צדידא'''; Arabic: '''كحل''', and which can also refer to [[antimony trisulfide]]. See also Z. Dori, ''Antimony and Henna'' (Heb. '''הפוך והכופר'''), Jerusalem 1983 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as [[lead]] upon its discovery. The earliest known description of the metal in the West was written in 1540 by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]].

For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]]. The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and [[carbothermic reaction|reduction with carbon]] or direct reduction of [[stibnite]] with iron.

The largest applications for metallic antimony are an alloy with [[lead]] and [[tin]] and the lead antimony plates in [[lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]]. Alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for [[solder]]s, [[bullet]]s, and [[plain bearing]]s. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing [[fire retardant]]s found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in [[microelectronics]].

==Characteristics==

===Properties===
[[File:Antimon.PNG|thumb|left|alt=A clear vial containing small chunks of a slightly lustrous black solid, labeled &quot;Sb&quot;.|A vial containing the black [[allotrope]] of antimony]]
[[File:Antimony massive.jpg|left|thumb|alt=An irregular piece of silvery stone with spots of variation in luster and shade.|Native antimony with [[redox|oxidation]] products]]

Antimony is a member of [[Group (periodic table)|group 15]] of the periodic table, one of the elements called [[pnictogen]]s, and has an [[electronegativity]] of 2.05. In accordance with periodic trends, it is more electronegative than [[tin]] or [[bismuth]], and less electronegative than [[tellurium]] or [[arsenic]]. Antimony is stable in air at room temperature, but reacts with [[oxygen]] if heated to produce [[antimony trioxide]], Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|758}}

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metalloid with a [[Mohs scale]] hardness of 3, which is too soft to make hard objects; coins of antimony were issued in China's [[Guizhou]] province in 1931 but the durability was poor and the minting was soon discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcoinpics.co.uk/metal.html|title=Metals Used in Coins and Medals|publisher=ukcoinpics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony is resistant to attack by acids.

Four [[allotropy|allotropes]] of antimony are known: a stable metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a [[brittle]], silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a [[trigonal]] cell, [[isomorphic]] with the gray allotrope of [[arsenic]]. A rare [[explosive form of antimony]] can be formed from the electrolysis of [[antimony trichloride]]. When scratched with a sharp implement, an [[exothermic]] reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as [[red phosphorus]] and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100&amp;nbsp;°C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of [[stibine]] (SbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at −90&amp;nbsp;°C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this [[metastability|metastable]] allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cww&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&amp;pg=PA50|pages=50–51|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental antimony adopts a layered structure ([[space group]] R{{overline|3}}m No. 166) in which layers consist of fused, ruffled, six-membered rings. The nearest and next-nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex, with the three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6.697&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|758}}

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of antimony}}
Antimony has two stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;121&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a [[half-life]] of 2.75&amp;nbsp;years. In addition, 29 [[nuclear isomer|metastable]] states have been characterized. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;120m1&lt;/sup&gt;Sb with a [[half-life]] of 5.76&amp;nbsp;days. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Sb tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], and those that are heavier tend to decay by [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]], with some exceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occurrence===
{{See also|Category:Antimonide minerals|Category:Antimonate minerals}}
[[File:Stibnite.jpg|thumb|[[Stibnite]],China CM29287 Carnegie Museum of Natural History specimen on display in Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems|alt=]]
The abundance of antimony in the [[Earth]]'s crust is estimated to be 0.2 to 0.5 [[part per million|parts per million]], comparable to [[thallium]] at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2016-antim.pdf|title=Mineral Commodity Summaries: Antimony|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in more than 100 [[mineral]] species. Antimony is sometimes found natively (e.g. on [[Antimony Peak]]), but more frequently it is found in the sulfide [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is the predominant ore [[mineral]].&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;&lt;!--Commercial forms of antimony are generally [[ingot]]s, broken pieces, [[granular material|granules]], and cast cake. Other forms are [[powder (substance)|powder]], shot, and [[single crystal]]s.{{fact|date=February 2012}}--&gt;

==Compounds==
{{See also|Category:Antimony compounds}}
Antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state: Sb(III) and Sb(V).&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; The +5 [[oxidation state]] is more stable.

===Oxides and hydroxides===
[[Antimony trioxide]] is formed when antimony is burnt in air.&lt;ref name=&quot;reger2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry: Principles and Practice|author=Reger, Daniel L.|author2=Goode, Scott R.|author3=Ball, David W.|last-author-amp=yes|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUIaM1V3ThsC&amp;pg=PA883|publisher=Cengage Learning|date=2009|isbn=978-0-534-42012-3|page=883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the gas phase, the molecule of the compound is {{chem|Sb|4|O|6}}, but it polymerizes upon condensing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt; [[Antimony pentoxide]] ({{chem|Sb|4|O|10}}) can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;house&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|author=House, James E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocKWuxOur-kC&amp;pg=PA502|date=2008|isbn=978-0-12-356786-4|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, [[antimony tetroxide]] ({{chem|Sb|2|O|4}}), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V).&lt;ref name=&quot;house&quot;/&gt; Unlike oxides of [[phosphorus]] and [[arsenic]], these oxides are [[amphoteric]], do not form well-defined [[oxoacid]]s, and react with acids to form antimony salts.

Antimonous acid {{chem|Sb(OH)|3}} is unknown, but the conjugate base sodium antimonite ({{chem|[Na|3|SbO|3|]|4}}) forms upon fusing [[sodium oxide]] and {{chem|Sb|4|O|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|763}} Transition metal antimonites are also known.&lt;ref name=&quot;norman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|author=Godfrey, S.

Many antimony ores are sulfides, including [[stibnite]] ({{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}), [[pyrargyrite]] ({{chem|Ag|3|SbS|3}}), [[zinkenite]], [[jamesonite]], and [[boulangerite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|757}} [[Antimony pentasulfide]] is [[non-stoichiometric compound|non-stoichiometric]] and features antimony in the +3 [[oxidation state]] and S-S bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0020-1650(69)80231-X|title=The oxidation number of antimony in antimony pentasulfide|date=1969|last1=Long|first1=G.|journal=Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters|volume=5|page=21|last2=Stevens|first2=J. G.|last3=Bowen|first3=L. H.|last4=Ruby|first4=S. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thioantimonides are known, such as {{chem|[Sb|6|S|10|]|2-}} and {{chem|[Sb|8|S|13|]|2-}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jpcs.2006.12.010|title=The synthesis and characterisation of four new antimony sulphides incorporating transition-metal complexes|date=2007|last1=Lees|first1=R.|last2=Powell|first2=A.|last3=Chippindale|first3=A.|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|volume=68|page=1215|bibcode=2007JPCS...68.1215L|issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halides===
Antimony forms two series of [[halide]]s: {{chem|SbX|3}} and {{chem|SbX|5}}. The trihalides [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]], [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]], [[antimony tribromide|{{chem|SbBr|3}}]], and [[antimony triiodide|{{chem|SbI|3}}]] are all molecular compounds having [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]].

The trifluoride [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]] is prepared by the reaction of [[antimony trioxide|{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}}]] with [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|761–762}}
:{{chem|Sb|2|O|3}} + 6 HF → 2 {{chem|SbF|3}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|O}}

It is [[Lewis acid]]ic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions {{chem|SbF|4|-}} and {{chem|SbF|5|2-}}. Molten [[antimony trifluoride|{{chem|SbF|3}}]] is a weak [[electrical conductor]]. The trichloride [[antimony trichloride|{{chem|SbCl|3}}]] is prepared by dissolving [[stibnite|{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}]] in [[hydrochloric acid]]:
:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 6 HCl → 2 {{chem|SbCl|3}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|S}}
[[File:Antimony-pentafluoride-monomer-3D-balls.png|thumb|upright|left|Structure of gaseous SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The pentahalides [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] and [[antimony pentachloride|{{chem|SbCl|5}}]] have [[trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry]] in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase, [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] is [[polymer]]ic, whereas [[antimony pentachloride|{{chem|SbCl|5}}]] is monomeric.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic chemistry|author=Wiberg, Egon|author2=Wiberg, Nils|author3=Holleman, Arnold Frederick|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Academic Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|761}} [[Antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]] is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the [[superacid]] [[fluoroantimonic acid]] (&quot;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;).

[[Oxohalide|Oxyhalides]] are more common for antimony than for arsenic and phosphorus. [[Antimony trioxide]] dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as [[antimony oxychloride|SbOCl]] and {{chem|(SbO)|2|SO|4}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|764}}

===Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds===
Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. Antimony forms [[antimonide]]s with metals, such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) and silver antimonide ({{chem|Ag|3|Sb}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg_holleman&quot;/&gt;{{rp|760}} The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, such as Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb and Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the highly unstable gas [[stibine]], {{chem|SbH|3}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Chemistry&amp;nbsp;– A Textbook for College Students|author=Kahlenberg, Louis|publisher=READ BOOKS|date=2008|isbn=978-1-4097-6995-8|pages=324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{chem|Sb|3-}} + 3 {{chem|H|+}} → {{chem|SbH|3}}
Stibine can also be produced by treating {{chem|Sb|3+}} salts with hydride reagents such as [[sodium borohydride]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature. Because stibine has a positive [[heat of formation]], it is [[thermodynamic stability|thermodynamically unstable]] and thus antimony does not react with [[hydrogen]] directly.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organoantimony chemistry|Organoantimony compounds]] are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with [[Grignard reagent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Elschenbroich, C. &quot;Organometallics&quot; (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|3-527-29390-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers, including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations. Examples include Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[triphenylstibine]]), Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic [Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and several related halides.

==History==
[[File:antimony-symbol.svg|upright=0.3|thumb|alt=An unshaded circle surmounted by a cross.|One of the [[alchemical symbol]]s for antimony]]
[[Antimony(III) sulfide]], Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, was recognized in [[predynastic Egypt]] as an eye cosmetic ([[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]) as early as about [[4th millennium BC|3100 BC]], when the [[cosmetic palette]] was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2006.00279.x|title=Application of Lead Isotope Analysis to a Wide Range of Late Bronze Age Egyptian Materials|date=2006|last1=Shortland|first1=A. J.|journal=Archaeometry|volume=48|issue=4|page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An artifact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at [[Girsu|Telloh]], [[Chaldea]] (part of present-day [[Iraq]]), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt; Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone in 1892&lt;ref name=moorey&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorey|first=P. R. S.|date=1994|title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: the Archaeological Evidence|place=New York|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=241|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA241|isbn=978-1-57506-042-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented that &quot;we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal, which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase, and therefore this remarkable 'find' (artifact mentioned above) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable.&quot;&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt;

Moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Tello object (published in 1975), &quot;attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony&quot; (i.e. native metal) and that &quot;the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments.&quot;&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt; This weakens the evidence for a lost art &quot;of rendering antimony malleable.&quot;&lt;ref name=moorey/&gt;

The Roman scholar [[Pliny the Elder]] described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']].&lt;ref name=mellor&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BGE6AQAAIAAJ|chapter=Antimony|page=339|title=A comprehensive treatise on inorganic and theoretical chemistry|volume=9|author=Mellor, Joseph William|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny the Elder also made a distinction between &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; forms of antimony; the male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, has been suspected to be native metallic antimony.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural history]]'', 33.33; W.H.S. Jones, the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translator, supplies a note suggesting the identifications.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek naturalist [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air. It is thought that this produced metallic antimony.&lt;ref name=mellor/&gt;

[[File:Specola, medaglione di vannoccio biringucci.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Italian metallurgist [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] described a procedure to isolate antimony.]]

The intentional isolation of antimony is described by [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] before 815 AD.&lt;ref name=Sarton&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science''. &quot;We find in his writings [...] preparation of various substances (e.g., basic lead carbonatic, arsenic and antimony from their sulphides).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A description of a procedure for isolating antimony is later given in the 1540 book ''[[De la pirotechnia]]'' by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]],&lt;ref&gt;Vannoccio Biringuccio, [http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/delapirotechnial00biri ''De la Pirotechnia''] (Venice (Italy): Curtio Navo e fratelli, 1540), Book 2, chapter 3: ''Del antimonio &amp; sua miniera, Capitolo terzo'' (On antimony and its ore, third chapter), pp. 27-28. [Note: Only every second page of this book is numbered, so the relevant passage is to be found on the 74th and 75th pages of the text.] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; predating the more famous 1556 book by [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]], ''[[De re metallica]]''. In this context Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony. The book ''Currus Triumphalis Antimonii'' (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), describing the preparation of metallic antimony, was published in Germany in 1604. It was purported to be written by a [[Benedictine]] monk, writing under the name [[Basilius Valentinus]] in the 15th century; if it were authentic, which it is not, it would predate Biringuccio.{{refn|Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von [[Leibniz]], after careful inquiry, concluded the work was spurious, there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the book's author was its ostensible editor, [[Johann Thölde]] ([[circa|c.]] 1565 – c. 1624).

The metal antimony was known to German chemist [[Andreas Libavius]] in 1615 who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide, salt and potassium [[tartrate]]. This procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface.&lt;ref name=mellor/&gt;

With the advent of challenges to [[phlogiston theory]], it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides, oxides, and other compounds, as do other metals.&lt;ref name=mellor/&gt;

The first discovery of naturally occurring pure antimony in the [[Earth's crust]] was described by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] scientist and local mine district engineer [[Anton von Swab]] in 1783; the [[type locality (geology)|type-sample]] was collected from the [[Sala Silver Mine]] in the Bergslagen mining district of [[Sala Municipality, Sweden|Sala]], [[Västmanland County|Västmanland]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-262.html|title=Native antimony|publisher=Mindat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14786440308676406|title=XL.

===Etymology===
The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late [[Byzantine Greek]] take their names for antimony, is ''antimonium''. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The [[popular etymology]], from ἀντίμοναχός ''anti-monachos'' or French ''antimoine'', still has adherents; this would mean &quot;monk-killer&quot;, and is explained by many early [[alchemist]]s being monks, and antimony being poisonous.&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{OEtymD|antimony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular etymology is the hypothetical Greek word ἀντίμόνος ''antimonos'', &quot;against aloneness&quot;, explained as &quot;not found as metal&quot;, or &quot;not found unalloyed&quot;.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;&quot;Antimony&quot; in ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'', 5th ed. 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-471-48494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fernando, Diana|title=Alchemy: an illustrated A to Z|date=1998|publisher=Blandford}} Fernando even derives it from the story of how &quot;Basil Valentine&quot; and his fellow monastic alchemists poisoned themselves by working with antimony; ''antimonium'' is found two centuries before his time. &quot;Popular etymology&quot; from ''OED''; as for ''antimonos'', the pure negative would be more naturally expressed by ''a-'' &quot;not&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Lippmann conjectured a hypothetical Greek word ανθήμόνιον ''anthemonion'', which would mean &quot;floret&quot;, and cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological [[efflorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, pp. 643–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The early uses of ''antimonium'' include the translations, in 1050–1100, by [[Constantine the African]] of Arabic medical treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, p. 642, writing in 1919, says &quot;''zuerst''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Several authorities believe ''antimonium'' is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from ''ithmid'';&lt;ref&gt;Meyerhof as quoted in Sarton, asserts that ''ithmid'' or ''athmoud'' became corrupted in the medieval &quot;traductions barbaro-latines&quot;.; the ''OED'' asserts some Arabic form is the origin, and if ''ithmid'' is the root, posits ''athimodium, atimodium, atimonium'', as intermediate forms.&lt;/ref&gt; other possibilities include ''athimar'', the Arabic name of the metalloid, and a hypothetical ''as-stimmi'', derived from or parallel to the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Endlich, p. 28; one of the advantages of ''as-stimmi'' would be that it has a whole syllable in common with ''antimonium''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2451020|pages=21–32|last1=Endlich|first1=F. M.|title=On Some Interesting Derivations of Mineral Names|volume=22|issue=253|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1888|doi=10.1086/274630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard chemical symbol for antimony (Sb) is credited to [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], who derived the abbreviation from ''stibium''.&lt;ref&gt;In his long article on chemical reactions and nomenclature – Jöns Jacob Berzelius, &quot;Essay on the cause of chemical proportions, and on some circumstances relating to them: together with a short and easy method of expressing them,&quot; ''Annals of Philosophy'', vol. 2, pages 443–454 (1813) and vol. 3, pages 51–62, 93–106, 244–255, 353–364 (1814) – on [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8M4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 page 52], Berzelius lists the symbol for antimony as &quot;St&quot;; however, starting on [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8M4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA248 page 248], Berzelius subsequently uses the symbol &quot;Sb&quot; for antimony.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], the sulfide of antimony.
The Egyptians called antimony ''mśdmt'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albright|first=W. F.|title=Notes on Egypto-Semitic Etymology. II|journal=The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures|volume=34|issue=4|date=1918|jstor=528157|pages=215–255 [230]|doi=10.1086/369866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sarton&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarton, George|date=1935|title=Review of ''Al-morchid fi'l-kohhl, ou Le guide d'oculistique''|others=Translated by Max Meyerhof|journal=Isis|volume=22|issue=2|language=French|jstor=225136|pages=539–542 [541]|doi=10.1086/346926}} quotes Meyerhof, the translator of the book he is reviewing.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[hieroglyphs]], the vowels are uncertain, but the Coptic form of the word is ⲥⲧⲏⲙ (stēm). The Greek word, στίμμι ''stimmi'', is probably a [[loan word]] from Arabic or from Egyptian ''stm''&lt;ref name=etym/&gt; &lt;hiero&gt;O34:D46-G17-F21:D4&lt;/hiero&gt; and is used by [[Attica|Attic]] [[tragedy|tragic]] [[poet]]s of the 5th century BC. Later Greeks also used στἰβι ''stibi'', as did [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names ''stimi'' {{sic}}, ''larbaris'', [[alabaster]], and the &quot;very common&quot; ''platyophthalmos'', &quot;wide-eye&quot; (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as ''stibium''. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as إثمد ''ithmid, athmoud, othmod'', or ''uthmod''. [[Littré]] suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from ''stimmida'', an accusative for ''stimmi''.&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]], ''s.v.'', vocalisation, spelling, and declension vary; Endlich, p. 28; Celsus, 6.6.6 ff; Pliny ''Natural History'' 33.33; Lewis and Short: ''Latin Dictionary''.

===Top producers and production volumes===
The [[British Geological Survey]] (BGS) reported that in 2005 China was the top producer of antimony with approximately 84% of the world share, followed at a distance by South Africa, Bolivia and Tajikistan. [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]] province has the largest deposits in China with an estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(03)00187-6|title=Samarium–neodymium isotope systematics of hydrothermal calcites from the Xikuangshan antimony deposit (Hunan, China): the potential of calcite as a geochronometer|date=2003|last1=Peng|first1=J.|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=200|issue=1–2|page=129|last2=Hu|first2=R.-Z.|last3=Burnard|first3=P.

In 2016, according to the [[US Geological Survey]], China accounted for 76.9% of total antimony production, followed in second place by Russia with 6.9% and Tajikistan with 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2017-antim.pdf |title=Antimony Statistics and Information|last=|first=|date=|website=National Minerals Information Center|publisher = USGS|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese production of antimony is expected to decline in the future as mines and smelters are closed down by the government as part of pollution control. Especially due to a new environmental protection law having gone into effect on January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/Environmental-Protection-Law-2014-eversion.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China|last=|first=|date=24 April 2014|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised “Emission Standards of Pollutants for Stanum, Antimony, and Mercury” having gone into effect, hurdles for economic production are higher. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in China, by September 2015 50% of antimony production capacity in the Hunan province (the province with biggest antimony reserves in China) had not been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/antimony/mcs-2016-antim.pdf|title=U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries: Antimony|last=|first=|date=1 January 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reported production of antimony in China has fallen and is unlikely to increase in the coming years, according to the Roskill report. No significant antimony deposits in China have been developed for about ten years, and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roskill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancoa.com.au/RoskillCRT.pdf|title=Study of the antimony market by Roskill Consulting Group|access-date=9 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018034957/http://www.ancoa.com.au/RoskillCRT.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2012|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production process===
The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower-grade ores are concentrated by [[froth flotation]], while higher-grade ores are heated to 500–600&amp;nbsp;°C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the [[gangue]] minerals. Antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by reduction with scrap iron:&lt;ref name=&quot;of03&quot;/&gt;

:{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} + 3 Fe → 2 Sb + 3 FeS

The sulfide is converted to an oxide; the product is then roasted, sometimes for the purpose of vaporizing the volatile antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norm&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2003.10.014|title=Antimony distribution and environmental mobility at an historic antimony smelter site, New Zealand|date=2004|last1=Wilson|first1=N. J.|last2=Craw|first2=D.|last3=Hunter|first3=K.|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=129|issue=2|pages=257–66|pmid=14987811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antimony is isolated from the oxide by a carbothermal reduction:&lt;ref name=&quot;of03&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norm&quot;/&gt;

:2 {{chem|Sb|2|O|3}} + 3 C → 4 Sb + 3 {{chem|CO|2}}

The lower-grade ores are reduced in [[blast furnace]]s while the higher-grade ores are reduced in [[reverberatory furnace]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;of03&quot;/&gt;

===Supply risk and critical mineral rankings===
Antimony has consistently been ranked high in European and US [[Critical mineral raw materials|risk lists concerning criticality of the element]] indicating the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current economy and lifestyle.

With most of the antimony imported into Europe and the US coming from China, Chinese production is critical to supply. As China is revising and increasing environmental control standards, antimony production is becoming increasingly restricted. Additionally Chinese export quotas for antimony have been decreasing in the past years. These two factors increase supply risk for both Europe and US.

====Europe====
According to the BGS Risk List 2015, antimony is ranked second highest (after rare earth elements) on the relative supply risk index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/statistics/risklist.html|title=MineralsUK Risk List 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that it has currently the second highest supply risk for chemical elements or element groups which are of economic value to the British economy and lifestyle.
Furthermore, antimony was identified as one of 20 critical raw materials for the EU in a report published in 2014 (which revised the initial report published in 2011). As seen in Figure xxx antimony maintains high supply risk relative to its economic importance. 92% of the antimony is imported from China, which is a significantly high concentration of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52014DC0297|title=Review of the list of critical raw materials for the EU and the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S.====
Much analysis has been conducted in the U.S. toward defining which metals should be called strategic or critical to the nation's security. Exact definitions do not exist, and views as to what constitutes a strategic or critical mineral to U.S. security diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanresources.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ARPN_Quarterly_Report_WEB.pdf|title=American Resources Policy Network Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, no antimony was mined in the U.S. The metal is imported from foreign countries. In the period 2011–2014, 68% of America's antimony came from China, 14% from India, 4% from Mexico, and 14% from other sources. There are no publicly known government stockpiles in place currently.

The U.S. &quot;Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains&quot; has screened 78 mineral resources from 1996–2008. It found that a small subset of minerals including antimony has fallen into the category of potentially critical minerals consistently. In the future, a second assessment will be made of the found subset of minerals to identify which should be defined of significant risk and critical to U.S. interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/specific-interest/critical_en|title=Critical Raw Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
About 60% of antimony is consumed in [[flame retardant]]s, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings, and solders.&lt;ref name=&quot;of03&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-019/of03-019.pdf|first1=C.|last1=Butterman|first2=J. F.|last2=Carlin, Jr.|date=2003|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Mineral Commodity Profiles: Antimony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flame retardants ===

Antimony is mainly used as the [[antimony trioxide|trioxide]] for [[flame retardant|flame-proofing compounds]], always in combination with halogenated flame retardants except in halogen-containing polymers. The flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide is produced by the formation of halogenated antimony compounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG9VFSBnIPAC&amp;pg=PA61|chapter=Antimony trioxide and Related Compounds|title=Flame retardants for plastics and textiles: Practical applications|isbn=978-3-446-41652-9|last1=Weil|first1=Edward D.|last2=Levchik|first2=Sergei V.|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8--&gt; which react with hydrogen atoms, and probably also with oxygen atoms and OH radicals, thus inhibiting fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0010-2180(73)90006-0|title=Mass spectrometric studies of flame inhibition: Analysis of antimony trihalides in flames|date=1973|last1=Hastie|first1=John W.|journal=Combustion and Flame|volume=21|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markets for these flame-retardants include children's clothing, toys, aircraft, and automobile seat covers. They are also added to [[polyester resin]]s in [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] [[composite material|composites]] for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn in the presence of an externally generated flame, but will extinguish when the external flame is removed.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Grund, Sabina C.; Hanusch, Kunibert; Breunig, Hans J.; Wolf, Hans Uwe (2006) &quot;Antimony and Antimony Compounds&quot; in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a03_055.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG9VFSBnIPAC&amp;pg=PA15|pages=15–16|title=Flame retardants for plastics and textiles: Practical applications|isbn=978-3-446-41652-9|last1=Weil|first1=Edward D.|last2=Levchik|first2=Sergei V.|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alloys ===

Antimony forms a highly useful [[alloy]] with [[lead]], increasing its hardness and mechanical strength. For most applications involving lead, varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal. In [[lead–acid batteries]], this addition improves plate strength and charging characteristics.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Types of Alloys|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=1HSsx9fPAKkC&amp;pg=PA60|title=Battery Technology Handbook|first=Heinz Albert|last=Kiehne|publisher=CRC Press|date=2003|pages=60–61|isbn=978-0-8247-4249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sailboats, lead keels are used as counterweights, ranging from 600 lbs to over 8000 lbs; to improve hardness and tensile strength of the lead keel, antimony is mixed with lead between 2% and 5% by volume. Antimony is used in antifriction alloys (such as [[Babbitt metal]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-4067-4671-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KR82QRlAgUwC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Principles of Metallography|last=Williams|first=Robert S.|publisher=Read books|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[bullet]]s and [[lead shot]], [[electrical cable]] sheathing, [[type metal]] (for example, for [[Linotype machine|linotype]] printing machines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IYZezyEvZ78C&amp;pg=PA399|title=Inorganic Chemistry&amp;nbsp;– A Textbook for Colleges and Schools|first=E.

=== Other applications ===

Three other applications consume nearly all the rest of the world's supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;of03&quot;/&gt; One application is as a stabilizer and catalyst for the production of [[polyethylene terephthalate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;of03&quot;/&gt; Another is as a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in [[glass]], mostly for TV screens;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_365|chapter=Glass|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|last1=De Jong|first1=Bernard H.

Historically, the powder derived from crushed antimony (''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]'') has been applied to the eyes with a metal rod and with one's spittle, thought by the ancients to aid in curing eye infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Rabbeinu Hananel's Commentary on Tractate Shabbat|title=Perushe Rabenu Ḥananʼel Bar Ḥushiʼel la-Talmud |last=Rabbeinu Hananel|author-link=Chananel ben Chushiel |volume= |publisher=Mekhon 'Lev Sameaḥ'|editor-last=Metzger|editor-first=David|editor-link= |place=Jerusalem|page=215 (Shabbat 109a) |year=1995 |language=Hebrew |oclc=319767989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is still seen in [[Yemen]] and in other Arabian countries.

== Precautions ==

The effects of antimony and its compounds on human and environmental health differ widely. Elemental antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. The effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble Sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance, lung overload, inflammation and ultimately tumour formation, not to exposure to antimony ions (OECD, 2008). Antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin. The effects of antimony are not comparable to those of arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism, and excretion between arsenic and antimony.

For oral absorption, ICRP (1994) has recommended values of 10% for tartar emetic and 1% for all other antimony compounds. Dermal absorption for metals is estimated to be at most 1% (HERAG, 2007). Inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble Sb(III) substances (such as antimony dust) is estimated at 6.8% (OECD, 2008), whereas a value &lt;1% is derived for Sb(V) substances. Antimony(V) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony(III) in the cell, and both species exist simultaneously.

Antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine. Antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects, with the exception of [[antimony potassium tartrate]] (&quot;tartar emetic&quot;), a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat [[leishmaniasis]] patients.

Prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis. However, it was agreed at the European Union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance-specific, but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts (ECHA/PR/09/09, Helsinki, 6 July 2009). Antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{PGCH|0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antimony is incompatible with strong acids, halogenated acids, and oxidizers; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form [[stibine]] (SbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

The 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) is set at 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] and by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) as a legal [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as an 8 hour TWA.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; Antimony compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) production. Some studies report minor antimony leaching from PET bottles into liquids, but levels are below drinking water guidelines. Antimony concentrations in fruit juice concentrates were somewhat higher (up to 44.7&amp;nbsp;µg/L of antimony), but juices do not fall under the drinking water regulations. The drinking water guidelines are:

=== Toxicity ===

Certain compounds of antimony appear to be toxic, particularly antimony trioxide and antimony potassium tartrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;atsdr.cdc.gov&quot;&gt;https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Effects may be similar to arsenic poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/antimony-poisoning|title=Antimony poisoning|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational exposure may cause respiratory irritation, pneumoconiosis, antimony spots on the skin, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, antimony trioxide is potentially carcinogenic to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 3037053|year = 2010|last1 = Sundar|first1 = S|title = Antimony Toxicity|journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume = 7|issue = 12|pages = 4267–4277|last2 = Chakravarty|first2 = J|pmid = 21318007|doi = 10.3390/ijerph7124267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverse health effects have been observed in humans and animals following inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to antimony and antimony compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;atsdr.cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; Antimony toxicity typically occurs either due to occupational exposure, during therapy or from accidental ingestion. It is unclear if antimony can enter the body through the skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;atsdr.cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
