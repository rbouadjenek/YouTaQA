His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.

Born in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British &quot;[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Blackmail/&gt; Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.

By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to [[Hollywood]]. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). ''Rebecca'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture]], although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]];&lt;ref name=Rebecca/&gt; he was also nominated for ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944) and ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award.  

The &quot;[[Hitchcockian]]&quot; style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film &quot;is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.&quot;{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}} 

After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[Dial M For Murder]]'' (1954).  By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films [[List of films considered the best|often ranked]] among the greatest of all time: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFI top 100&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Films of All Time |url=https://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |website=American Film Institute |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, ''Vertigo'' replaced [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[British Film Institute]]'s greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics.&lt;ref name=Christie2012/&gt; By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]],{{efn|The films selected for the [[National Film Registry]] are ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=21 December 2018}}{{pb}}

===Early life: 1899–1919===
====Early childhood and education====

Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents' leased grocer's shop at 517 High Road, [[Leytonstone]], on the outskirts of [[east London]] (then part of [[Essex]]), the youngest of three children: William Daniel (1890-1943), Ellen Kathleen (&quot;Nellie&quot;) (1892-1979), and Alfred Joseph (1899). His parents, Emma Jane Hitchcock, née Whelan (1863–1942), and William Edgar Hitchcock (1862–1914), were both [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], with partial roots in Ireland;{{sfn|Adair|2002|pp=11–12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishecho.com/2011/02/st-patricks-day-2005-the-master-of-suspense-2/|title=St. Patrick's Day 2005: The Master of Suspense|work= Irish Echo|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; William was a [[greengrocer]] as his father had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large extended family, including Uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road, [[Putney]], complete with maid, cook, chauffeur and gardener. Every summer John rented a seaside house for the family in [[Cliftonville]], Kent. Hitchcock said that he first became class-conscious there, noticing the differences between tourists and locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing himself as a well-behaved boy—his father called him his &quot;little lamb without a spot&quot;—Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=25}} One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes, saying, &quot;This is what we do to naughty boys.&quot; The experience left him, he said, with a lifelong fear of policemen; in 1973 he told [[Tom Snyder]] that he was &quot;scared stiff of anything&amp;nbsp;... to do with the law&quot; and wouldn't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket.&lt;ref&gt;For the police story: {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=25}}; [[Dick Cavett|Cavett, Dick]] (8 June 1972). &quot;Interview with Alfred Hitchcock&quot;, ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', ABC, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTx6N24tHk&amp;t=6m52s 00:06:52].{{pb}}

When he was six, the family moved to [[Limehouse]] and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane, which they ran as a [[fish and chips|fish-and-chips]] shop and fishmongers' respectively; they lived above the former.&lt;ref name=McG2003p13&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Hitchcock was seven when he attended his first school, the Howrah House Convent in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], which he entered in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], he stayed at Howrah House for at most two years. He also attended a convent school, the Wode Street School &quot;for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys&quot;, run by the [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]]; briefly attended a primary school near his home; and was for a very short time, when he was nine, a boarder at [[Salesian College, Battersea|Salesian College]] in [[Battersea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=29}}; {{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said it was here that he developed his sense of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Fallaci|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school register lists his year of birth as 1900 rather than 1899; Spoto writes that it seems he was deliberately enrolled as a 10-year-old, perhaps because he was a year behind with his schooling.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=23–24}} While biographer Gene Adair reports that Hitchcock was &quot;an average, or slightly above-average, pupil&quot;,{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}} Hitchcock said he was &quot;usually among the four or five at the top of the class&quot;;{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} at the end of his first year, his work in Latin, English, French and religious education was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favourite subject was geography, and he became interested in maps, and railway and bus timetables; according to Taylor, he could recite all the stops on the [[Orient Express]].{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=31}} He told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]: &quot;The Jesuits taught me organization, control and, to some degree, analysis.&quot;{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}}&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

====Henley's====
Hitchcock told his parents that he wanted to be an engineer,{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} and on 25 July 1913,&lt;ref name=Spoto1999p23&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left St Ignatius and enrolled in night classes at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar. In a [[Hitchcock/Truffaut|book-length interview]] in 1962, he told [[François Truffaut]] that he had studied &quot;mechanics, electricity, acoustics, and navigation&quot;.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} Then on 12 December 1914 his father, who had been suffering from emphysema and kidney disease, died at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support himself and his mother—his older siblings had left home by then—Hitchcock took a job, for 15 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] a week (£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|0.75|1914}}}} in 2017),{{inflation-fn|UK}} as a technical clerk at the [[William Thomas Henley|Henley Telegraph and Cable Company]] in Blomfield Street near [[London Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept up his night classes, this time in art history, painting, economics, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother ran the family shops, while he and his mother continued to live in Salmon Lane.{{sfn|Ackroyd|2015|p=11}}

Hitchcock was too young to enlist when the [[First World War]] broke out in July 1914, and when he reached the required age of 18 in 1917, he received a C3 classification (&quot;free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home&amp;nbsp;... only suitable for sedentary work&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=27–28}};&lt;!--check page--&gt; [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1918-06-20/debates/3ec12ba9-4d13-4c03-880a-226006f28d83/MilitaryService(MedicalGrading) &quot;Military service (medical grading&quot;)], ''Hansard'', vol. 107, 20 June 1918, 607–642.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a cadet regiment of the [[Royal Engineers]] and took part in theoretical briefings, weekend drills, and exercises. [[John Russell Taylor]] wrote that, in one session of practical exercises in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], Hitchcock was required to wear [[puttees]]. He could never master wrapping them around his legs, and they repeatedly fell down around his ankles.{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=28}}

After the war, Hitchcock began dabbling in creative writing. In June 1919 he became a founding editor and business manager of Henley's in-house publication, ''The Henley Telegraph'' (sixpence a copy), to which he submitted several short stories.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=30}}{{efn|In his first story, &quot;Gas&quot; (June 1919), published in the first issue, a young woman is being assaulted by a mob of men in Paris, only to find she has been hallucinating in the dentist's chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=20}}; Hitchcock, Alfred (June 1919).

&lt;!--say something here about finances; success of The Lodger, then 11,000 acres in Surrey--&gt;On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married the English-American screenwriter [[Alma Reville]] (1899–1982) at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Brompton Oratory]] in [[South Kensington]].&lt;!--check ref--&gt;{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=92–93}} The couple honeymooned in Paris, [[Lake Como]] and St. Moritz, before returning to London to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of 153 [[Cromwell Road]], Kensington.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=89–90}} Reville, who was born just hours after Hitchcock,{{sfn|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=15}} converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, apparently at the insistence of Hitchcock's mother; she was baptized on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at [[Westminster Cathedral]] by Cardinal [[Francis Bourne]] on 5 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also established the quintessential English &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot; ([[Madeleine Carroll]]) as the template for his succession of ice-cold, elegant leading ladies.

[[File:Hitchcocks-Joan-Harrison-1937.jpg|thumb|[[Alma Reville]], [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], Hitchcock, and [[Patricia Hitchcock]], 24 August 1937]]

Hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936. ''[[Sabotage (1936 film)|Sabotage]]'' was loosely based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel, ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907), about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist, and ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'', based on two stories in ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'' (1928) by [[W.

At this time, Hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew. These jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal. For instance, he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because, as he claimed, there weren't enough blue foods. He also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend, actor Sir Gerald du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/|title=Alfred Hitchcock: a sadistic prankster|last=Chilton|first=Martin|date=29 April 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=9 January 2019|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Mention Young and Innocent (1937); first meeting with Selznick--&gt;Hitchcock's next major success was ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), &quot;one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era&quot;, according to [[Philip French]], in which Miss Froy ([[May Whitty]]), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Philip|last=French|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/24/my-favourite-hitchcock-lady-vanishes |title=My favourite Hitchcock: The Lady Vanishes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film saw Hitchcock receive the 1939&amp;nbsp;[[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Director, the only time he won an award for his direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lady Vanishes |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80706/The-Lady-Vanishes/ |accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}} Benjamin Crisler, the ''New York Times'' film critic, wrote in June 1938: &quot;Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: [[Magna Carta]], the [[Tower Bridge]] and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crisler|first1=B.

===Early Hollywood years: 1939–1945===
====Selznick contract====
&lt;!--check that it was March, and say more about sources of tension with Selznick that led him to lend Hitchcock to other studios--&gt;[[David O. Selznick]] signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June that year ''Life'' magazine called him the &quot;greatest master of melodrama in screen history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date= 19 June 1939|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b0kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 66] |title=Alfred Hitchcock: England's Best Director starts work in Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working arrangements with Selznick were less than ideal. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often unhappy about Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock said: &quot;[Selznick] was the Big Producer.&amp;nbsp;... Producer was king. The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me—and it shows you the amount of control—he said I was the 'only director' he'd 'trust with a film'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Selznick complained about Hitchcock's &quot;goddamn jigsaw cutting&quot;, which meant that the producer had to follow Hitchcock's vision of the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selznick lent Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed by the superior resources of the American studios compared to the financial limits he had often faced in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rebecca (1940) - Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''Rebecca'' (1940)]]

The Selznick picture ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940) was Hitchcock's first American film, set in a Hollywood version of England's Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]]. The film stars [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]]. The story concerns a naïve (and unnamed) young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. She goes to live in his huge [[English country house]], and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[13th Academy Awards]]; the statuette was given to Selznick, as the film's producer. Hitchcock was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], his first of five such nominations.&lt;ref name=Rebecca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1941 |title=The 13th Academy Awards, 1941|accessdate=30 December 2017|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's second American film was the thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), set in Europe, based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s book ''Personal History'' (1935) and produced by [[Walter Wanger]]. It was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while his country was at war; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed in the first year of the [[Second World War]], it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by [[Joel McCrea]]. Mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood backlot, the film avoided direct references to [[Nazism]], [[Nazi Germany]], and [[German people|Germans]] to comply with Hollywood's [[Motion Picture Production Code]] censorship at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Cary Grant Joan Fontaine Suspicion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] in a publicity shot for ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941)]]
{{anchor|Suspicion}}''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer and director. It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four projects on which [[Cary Grant]] worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role. Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English  [[Confidence trick|con man]] whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw ([[Joan Fontaine]]).{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=434–435}} In one scene Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; the light makes sure that the audience's attention is on the glass. Grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he told François Truffaut, he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142–143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: &quot;They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer. So there was no film existing at all. That was ridiculous. Nevertheless, I had to compromise on the end. What I wanted to do was that the wife was aware that she was going to be murdered by her husband, so she wrote a letter to her mother saying that she was very much in love with him, she didn't want live anymore, she was going to be killed but society should be protected. She therefore brings up this fatal glass of milk, drinks it and before she does she says, &quot;Will you mail this letter to mother?&quot; Then she drinks the milk and dies. You then have just one final scene of a cheerful Cary Grant going to the mailbox and posting the letter.&amp;nbsp;... But this was never permitted because of the basic error in casting.&quot;&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes/&gt;}} Fontaine won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luther|first1=Claudia|title=Joan Fontaine, actress who won Oscar for 'Suspicion,' dies at 96|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-joan-fontaine-actress-who-won-oscar-for-suspicion-dies-at-96-20131215|work=Los Angeles Times|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--added something about mother's death (26 September 1942) and brother's (4 January 1943)--&gt;''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for [[Universal Studios|Universal]] during the decade.

&lt;!--why was it his favourite?--&gt;''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943) was Hitchcock's personal favourite and the second of the early Universal films. Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]) suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of being a serial killer. Hitchcock again filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leitch|first1=Thomas|title=Shadow of a Doubt|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/shadow_of_doubt.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2017|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working at [[20th Century Fox]], Hitchcock approached [[John Steinbeck]] with an idea for a film, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack. Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for &quot;Reduco-Obesity Slayer&quot;.&lt;ref name=Spoto1999p267&gt;The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

{{quote|At the time, I was on a strenuous diet, painfully working my way from three hundred to two hundred pounds. So I decided to immortalize my loss and get my bit part by posing for &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; pictures.&amp;nbsp;... I was literally submerged by letters from fat people who wanted to know where and how they could get Reduco.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=158–159}}}}

Hitchcock's typical dinner before the weight loss had been a roast chicken, boiled ham, potatoes, bread, vegetables, relishes, salad, dessert, a bottle of wine and some brandy. To lose weight, he stopped drinking, drank black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and ate steak and salad for dinner, but it was hard to maintain; Spoto writes that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years. At the end of 1943, despite the weight loss, the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused him life insurance.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=266–267}}

Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short [[propaganda film]]s, ''[[Bon Voyage (1944 film)|Bon Voyage]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aventure Malgache]]'' (1944), for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. In June and July 1945 Hitchcock served as &quot;treatment advisor&quot; on a [[Holocaust]] documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The film was assembled in London and produced by [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on board. It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the [[British War Office]] film vaults to London's [[Imperial War Museum]] and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it: ''Memory of the Camps''. The full-length version of the film, ''[[German Concentration Camps Factual Survey]]'', was restored in 2014 by scholars at the Imperial War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeffries9Jan2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|title=The Holocaust film that was too shocking to show|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock|work=The Guardian|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory of the Camps: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war Hollywood years: 1945–1953===
====Later Selznick films====
[[File:Spellbound-1945.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gregory Peck]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)]]
Hitchcock worked for David Selznick again when he directed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), which explores [[psychoanalysis]] and features a [[dream sequence]] designed by [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyd |first=David |title=The Parted Eye: ''Spellbound'' and Psychoanalysis |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |year=2000 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224214107/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned; Selznick edited it to make it &quot;play&quot; more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1987|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Peck]] plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past.{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=408–412}} Two point-of-view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film. The original musical score by [[Miklós Rózsa]] makes use of the [[theremin]], and some of it was later adapted by the composer into Rozsa's Piano Concerto Op. 31 (1967) for piano and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Miklos Rozsa Society Website |url=http://www.miklosrozsa.info/mrs/works/aboutPianoConcerto.html |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!--mention ''The Paradine Case'' (1947) and the Motion Picture Production Code--&gt;''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) followed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.
Hitchcock told François Truffaut that Selznick had sold him, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and the screenplay by [[Ben Hecht]], to RKO Radio Pictures as a &quot;package&quot; for $500,000 ({{Inflation|US|500,000|1946|fmt=eq}}) because of cost overruns on Selznick's ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''Notorious'' stars Bergman and Grant, both Hitchcock regulars, and features a plot about Nazis, [[uranium]] and South America. His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} According to McGilligan, in or around March 1945 Hitchcock and [[Ben Hecht]] consulted [[Robert Millikan]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] about the development of a uranium bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was &quot;science fiction&quot;, only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in Japan in August 1945.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=370–371}}

====Transatlantic Pictures====
[[File:Ropetrailer2.jpg|thumb|A typical shot from ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) with [[James Stewart]] turning his back to the fixed camera|alt=A typical scene from ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' showing [[James Stewart]]]]

Hitchcock formed an independent production company, [[Transatlantic Pictures]], with his friend [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]]. He made two films with Transatlantic, one of which was his first colour film. With ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). The film appears to have been shot in a single take, but it was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from 4-{{frac|2}} to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. The film features [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock. It was inspired by the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The film was not well received.{{sfn|Evans|2017}}

''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in 19th-century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black-and-white films for several years. Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after these two unsuccessful films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leigh 1995&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Rebello 1990&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rebello|1990|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}} Hitchcock filmed ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950) at studios in [[Elstree Studios|Elstree]], England, where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2001|pp=62, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He matched one of [[Warner Bros.]]' most popular stars, [[Jane Wyman]], with the expatriate German actor [[Marlene Dietrich]] and used several prominent British actors, including [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]], [[Richard Todd]] and [[Alastair Sim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|Lasky|2002|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Hitchcock's first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 429, 774–775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Mention that, after falling out with Raymond Chandler, Hitchcock hired Czenzi Ormonde to work with Barbara Keon and Alma Reville; say more about the film, &quot;crisscross&quot;, and murder in spectacles scene--&gt;His film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) was based on the novel of the [[Strangers on a Train (novel)|same name]] by [[Patricia Highsmith]]. Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached [[Dashiell Hammett]] to write the dialogue, but [[Raymond Chandler]] took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. [[Farley Granger]]'s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]], previously known for &quot;boy-next-door&quot; roles, played the villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=320, 322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) was set in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] with [[Montgomery Clift]] as a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/I-Confess/notes.html | title=Notes: ''I Confess'' (1953)| author= | publisher=TCM | accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak years: 1954–1964===
====''Dial M for Murder'' and ''Rear Window''====
[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Still image from the film Read Window featuring Stewart and Kelly|[[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954)]]
''I Confess'' was followed by three colour films starring [[Grace Kelly]]: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955). In ''Dial M for Murder'', [[Ray Milland]] plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like murder. Her lover, Mark Halliday ([[Robert Cummings]]), and Police Inspector Hubbard ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]) save her from execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 78-80&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock experimented with [[3-D film|3D cinematography]] for ''Dial M''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Philip|title=Dial M for Murder 3D – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/dial-m-for-murder-3d-review|work=The Observer|date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--when did he move to Paramount? — Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, The Trouble with Harry (1955), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960)--&gt;Hitchcock moved to [[Paramount Pictures]] and filmed ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), starring James Stewart and Kelly again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Stewart's character is a photographer (based on [[Robert Capa]]) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Stewart eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) and his girlfriend (Kelly). As with ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case Stewart's studio apartment. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions, &quot;from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one [[electric chair]], while two are shown with a sign &quot;Two chairs—no waiting!&quot; He directed 18 episodes of the series, which aired from 1955 to 1965. It became ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1962, and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965. In the 1980s, a [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|new version]] of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a [[Film colorization|colourised]] form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--making this invisible for now; not sure where to place it: Hitchcock also appears as a character in the juvenile detective book series, ''[[Three Investigators|Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators]]''.

====From ''To Catch a Thief'' to ''Vertigo''====
In 1955 Hitchcock became a United States citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p= 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, his third Grace Kelly film, ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', was released; it is set in the French Riviera, and pairs Kelly with Cary Grant. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him. &quot;Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 366&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly. She married [[Prince Rainier]] of Monaco in 1956, and ended her film career. Hitchcock then remade his own [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|1934 film]] ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|in 1956]]. This time, the film starred James Stewart and [[Doris Day]], who sang the theme song &quot;[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera, Sera]]&quot;, which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Oscar for Best Original Song]] and became a big hit for her. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1994|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--January 1957: hernia surgery; March 1957: gallbladder removed--&gt;''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1957), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in ''Life'' magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star [[Henry Fonda]], playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife ([[Vera Miles]]) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 377&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this needs sources and a rewrite: At the height of Hitchcock's success in 1956, he was asked to introduce a set of short-story collections with his name attached.

&lt;!--1957, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], first book-length study of his work--&gt;&lt;!--moved this from the &quot;relationship with actors&quot; section: In the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially Truffaut, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the [[filmmaking]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moerbeek2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Moerbeek|2006|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}--&gt;[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Kim Novak at Golden Gate Bridge Fort Point.jpg|thumb|alt=Still image from the film Vertigo|[[Kim Novak]] by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958){{efn|A 2012 [[British Film Institute]] poll ranked ''Vertigo'' as the [[Sight &amp; Sound#2012|greatest film ever made]].&lt;ref name=Christie2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Christie|first=Ian|title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|work=Sight &amp; Sound|date=September 2012|accessdate=29 December 2017}}; also see {{cite news|title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics|publisher=British Film Institute|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]

Hitchcock's next film, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) again starred James Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. He had wanted [[Vera Miles]] to play the lead, but she was pregnant. He told [[Oriana Fallaci]]: &quot;I was offering her a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress. We'd have spent a heap of dollars on it, and she has the bad taste to get pregnant. I hate pregnant women, because then they have children.&quot;{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}

In the film, James Stewart plays Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Kim Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including [[Donald Spoto]] and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''Vertigo'' is the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]''-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other work in his filmography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kehr|2011|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--say something about the camera technique--&gt;''Vertigo'' contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts, commonly referred to as a [[dolly zoom]], that has been copied many times by filmmakers. The film premiered at the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], where Hitchcock won a Silver Seashell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Donostia Zinemaldia Festival de San Sebastian International Film Festival |url= http://www.sansebastianfestival.com/2007/es3/portada.php |accessdate=23 August 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306044915/http://www.sansebastianfestival.com/2007/es3/portada.php| archivedate= 6 March 2008| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}} ''Vertigo'' is considered a classic, but it attracted some negative reviews and poor box-office receipts at the time, and it was the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 376-77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2017}} In the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls, it ranked just behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941); ten years later, in the same magazine, critics chose it as the best film ever made.&lt;ref name=Christie2012/&gt;

====''North by Northwest'' and ''Psycho''====
{{see also|Psycho (franchise)}}
Hitchcock followed ''Vertigo'' with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among his best: ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''North by Northwest'', Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent.

====Truffaut interview====
{{further|Hitchcock/Truffaut|Hitchcock/Truffaut (film)}}
&lt;!--expand--&gt;On 13 August 1962, Hitchcock's 63rd birthday, the French director [[François Truffaut]] began a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions. It took four years to transcribe the tapes and organize the images; it was published as a book in 1967, which Truffaut nicknamed the &quot;Hitchbook&quot;. The audio tapes were used as the basis of a documentary in 2015.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|title='Actors are cattle': when Hitchcock met Truffaut|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/when-hitchcock-met-truffaut-hitchcock-truffaut-documentary-cannes|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that Hitchcock was not simply the mass-market entertainer the American media made him out to be. It was obvious from his films, Truffaut wrote, that Hitchcock had &quot;given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues&quot;. He compared the interview to &quot;Oedipus' consultation of the oracle&quot;.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=11–12}}

The film scholar Peter William Evans writes that ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964) are regarded as &quot;undisputed masterpieces&quot;.{{sfn|Evans|2017}} Hitchcock had intended to film ''Marnie'' first, and in March 1962 it was announced that [[Grace Kelly]], Princess Grace of Monaco since 1956, would come out of retirement to star in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alden|first1=Robert|title=Princess Grace Will Star in Hitchcock Movie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/20/archives/princess-grace-will-star-in-hitchcock-movie-she-accepts-her-first.html|work=The New York Times|date=20 March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kelly asked Hitchcock to postpone ''Marnie'' until 1963 or 1964, he recruited [[Ed McBain|Evan Hunter]], author of ''The Blackboard Jungle'' (1954), to develop a screenplay based on a [[Daphne du Maurier]] short story, &quot;[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]&quot; (1952), which Hitchcock had republished in his ''My Favorites in Suspense'' (1959).

In ''The Birds'', Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets lawyer Mitch Brenner ([[Rod Taylor]]) in a bird shop; [[Jessica Tandy]] plays his possessive mother. Hedren visits him in [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]] (where ''The Birds'' was filmed)&lt;ref name=McDonald1April1962/&gt; carrying a pair of [[lovebird]]s as a gift.

He said it was his most technically challenging film yet, using a combination of trained and mechanical birds against a backdrop of wild ones. Every shot was sketched in advance.&lt;ref name=McDonald1April1962/&gt;

An [[HBO]]/[[BBC]] television film, ''[[The Girl (2012 TV film)|The Girl]]'' (2012), depicted Hedren's experiences on set; she said that Hitchcock [[Tippi Hedren#Troubled relations|became obsessed with her]] and sexually harassed her.

She broke down after a bird cut her lower eyelid, and filming was halted on doctor's orders.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=457–459}}

====''Marnie''====
[[File:Marnie (1964) trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964)]]

In June 1962, Grace Kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964).&lt;!--explain why?--&gt; Hedren had signed an exclusive seven-year, $500-a-week contract with Hitchcock in October 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=270}};
{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he decided to cast her in the lead role opposite [[Sean Connery]]. In 2016, describing Hedren's performance as &quot;one of the greatest in the history of cinema&quot;, [[Richard Brody]] called the film a &quot;story of sexual violence&quot; inflicted on the character played by Hedren: &quot;The film is, to put it simply, sick, and it's so because Hitchcock was sick. He suffered all his life from furious sexual desire, suffered from the lack of its gratification, suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality, and then went ahead and did so virtually, by way of his art.&quot;&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|author-link=Richard Brody|title=&quot;Marnie&quot; Is the Cure for Hitchcock Mania|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania|work=The New Yorker|date=17 August 2016}}{{pb}}

In the film, Marnie Edgar (Hedren) steals $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10,000|1964|fmt=eq}}) from her employer and goes on the run. She applies for a job at Mark Rutland's (Connery) company in Philadelphia and steals from there too. Earlier she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red. Mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him. She explains that she does not want to be touched, but during the &quot;honeymoon&quot;, Mark rapes her. Marnie and Mark discover that Marnie's mother had been a prostitute when Marnie was a child, and that, while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm—the mother believed the client had tried to molest Marnie—Marnie had killed the client to save her mother. Cured of her fears when she remembers what happened, she decides to stay with Mark.&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaver13Aug2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cleaver|first1=Emily|title=My favourite Hitchcock: Marnie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/13/my-favourite-hitchcock-marnie|work=The Guardian|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer speaking to her because she had rebuffed him, Hitchcock apparently referred to Hedren throughout as &quot;the girl&quot; rather than by name. He told [[Robert Burks]], the cinematographer, that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to Hedren when he filmed her face.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=471}} [[Ed McBain|Evan Hunter]], the screenwriter of ''The Birds'' who was writing ''Marnie'' too, explained to Hitchcock that, if Mark loved Marnie, he would comfort her, not rape her.

===Later years: 1966–1980===
====Final films====
Failing health reduced Hitchcock's output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer [[Stephen Rebello]] claimed Universal &quot;forced&quot; two movies on him, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966) and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Rebello 1990&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Leigh 1995&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}} Both were spy thrillers with [[Cold War]]-related themes. ''Torn Curtain'', with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Julie Andrews]], precipitated the bitter end of the 12-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|pp=272–274}}; {{cite news|last=Stephens|first=Andrew|title=The sound of Hitchcock: How Bernard Herrmann's music brought his films to life|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock was unhappy with Herrmann's score and replaced him with [[John Addison]], [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|pp=273–274}} ''[[Topaz (novel)|Topaz]]'' (1967), based on a [[Leon Uris]] novel, is partly set in Cuba.

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock, San Francisco, Summer 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Image of Hitchcock seated during the filming of Family Plot| Hitchcock at work on ''[[Family Plot]]'', San Francisco, summer 1975]]

Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his penultimate film, ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), based on the novel ''[[Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square]]'' (1966). After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the &quot;Necktie Murders&quot;, which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites as in ''Strangers on a Train''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Frenzy'', Hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time. Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled;{{sfn|Evans|2017}} Spoto called the latter &quot;one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film&quot;. Both actors, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] and [[Anna Massey]], refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=513–514}} Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the longtime head of Hollywood's [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's &quot;inescapable inferences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler, played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi-driver lover [[Bruce Dern]], making a living from her phony powers. While ''Family Plot'' was based on the [[Victor Canning]] novel ''[[The Rainbird Pattern]]'' (1972), the novel's tone is more sinister. Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] originally wrote the film with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Knighthood and death====
&lt;!--add American Film Institute Life Achievement Award and speech about his wife--&gt;Toward the end of his life, Hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with [[James Costigan]], [[Ernest Lehman]] and [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Despite preliminary work, it was never filmed. Hitchcock's health was declining and he was worried about his wife, who had suffered a stroke. The screenplay was eventually published in Freeman's book ''The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 731–734}}; {{harvnb|Freeman|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Don't worry, they all get punished in the end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bidisha|authorlink1=Bidisha|title=What's wrong with Hitchcock's women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/alfred-hitchcock-women-psycho-the-birds-bidisha|work=The Guardian|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a widely cited essay in 1975, [[Laura Mulvey]] introduced the idea of the [[male gaze]]; the view of the spectator in Hitchcock's films, she argued, is that of the heterosexual male protagonist.{{sfn|Mulvey|1989}} &quot;The female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again&quot;, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in 1996. &quot;They were blonde. They were icy and remote. They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerised the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958 |title=Vertigo|date=13 October 1996|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1967 Hitchcock told Truffaut: &quot;I think the most interesting women, sexually, are the English women. I feel that the English women, the Swedes, the northern Germans, and Scandinavians are a great deal more exciting than the Latin, the Italian, and the French women. Sex should not be advertised. An English girl, looking like a schoolteacher, is apt to get into a cab with you and, to your surprise, she'll probably pull a man's pants open.&amp;nbsp;... [W]ithout the element of ''surprise'' the scenes become meaningless. There's no possibility to ''discover'' sex.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=224}}}}

[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kim Novak]] and [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958)]]
The victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde. In ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.

His films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norman Bates|Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

Hitchcock became known for having remarked that &quot;actors are cattle.&quot;{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}{{efn|Hitchcock told Fallaci in 1963: &quot;When they [actors] aren't cows, they're children: that's something else I've often said. And everyone knows that there are good children, bad children, and stupid children. The majority of actors, though, are stupid children. They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea. His actors are made of paper; when he doesn't like them, he can tear them up.&quot;{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}}} During the filming of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941), [[Carole Lombard]] brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise him.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}

Hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: &quot;I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said 'That's not acting. That's writing.'&quot;&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock |publisher=British Film Institute|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210051052/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html#actors |archivedate=10 February 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Slezak]] said that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography |publisher=Simon and Schuster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKRhkdxsFs8C&amp;pg=PT133|isbn=978-1-84739-709-6 |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Critics observed that, despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances. He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock four times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as &quot;animated props&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told François Truffaut: &quot;The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing, storyboards and production===
Hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:

{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|title=Hitchcock: &quot;Never mess about with a dead body—you may be one&amp;nbsp;....|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{Citation|last=Pallant|first=Chris|title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding|date=2015|work=Storyboarding: A Critical History|volume=|pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris|series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6|isbn=978-1-137-02760-3|last2=Price|first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]
This view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.&lt;ref name= &quot;krohn1–7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217&quot;/&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]
Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage02-28-07&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April–May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each [[film poster]] for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Poster Master With a Cool Hand|first=Mekado|last=Murphy|date=3 December 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05posters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Bass]]—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217&quot;/&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

Many of the British actors in particular additionally appeared in some of the two dozen or so early films Hitchcock worked on in other capacities, such as co-writer, title designer, art director and assistant director. For instance, Clare Greet was also in ''Lord Camber's Ladies'' (1932), which Hitchcock produced, as were [[Benita Hume]] and [[A. Bromley Davenport]], who had been in ''Easy Virtue'' (1928) and ''Jamaica Inn'' (1939) respectively. Leslie Banks also starred in ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' (1935), which Hitchcock directed in its earliest stages. Meanwhile, other recurring actors featured in other Hitchcock projects, as with Peter Lorre, who also appeared in two episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents''.
