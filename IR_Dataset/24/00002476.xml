'''Abae''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄβαι}}, ''Abai'')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avery|1962|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephanus&gt;{{Cite Stephanus|''s.v.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient town in the northeastern corner of [[ancient Phocis]], in [[Greece]], near the frontiers of the [[Opuntian Locrians]], said to have been built by the [[ancient Argos|Argive]] [[Abas (son of Lynceus)|Abas]], son of [[Lynceus]] and [[Hypermnestra]], and grandson of [[Danaus]]. It was famous in antiquity for its [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]] [[Abaeus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitz|2013|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of those consulted by [[Croesus]], king of [[Lydia]],&lt;ref name = Her&gt;{{harvnb|Herodotus|1920|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hesychius|Schmidt|1867|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = p2/&gt; and [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Before the Persian invasion the temple was richly adorned with treasuries and votive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herodotus|2003|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was twice destroyed by fire; the first time by the [[ancient Persia|Persians]] in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in their march through Phocis (480&amp;nbsp;BCE), and a second time by the [[ancient Boeotia|Boeotians]] in the [[Third Sacred War|Sacred or Phocian War]] in 346&amp;nbsp;BCE. It was rebuilt by [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian caused a smaller temple to be built near the ruins of the former one. In the new temple there were three ancient statues in brass of Apollo, [[Leto]], and [[Artemis]], which had been dedicated by the Abaei, and had perhaps been saved from the former temple. The ancient [[agora]] and the ancient theatre still existed in the town in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. According to the statement of [[Aristotle]], as preserved by [[Strabo]], [[Thracians]] from the Phocian town of Abae emigrated to [[Euboea]], and gave to the inhabitants the name of Abantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|10|35|1}} ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Herodotus|1.46, 8.134, 33.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Diodorus|16.530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Strabo|pp. 423, 445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephanus/&gt;

==Oracle==
[[File:Αρχαιολογικός χώρος Καλαποδίου.jpg|thumb|400px|Remains of the sanctuary at [[Kalapodi]]]]
Despite destruction of the town, the oracle was still consulted, e.g. by the [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebans]] before the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BCE.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;{{harvnb|Pausanias|1898|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2000|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple, along with the village of the same name, may have escaped destruction during the [[Third Sacred War]] (355–346 BCE), due to the respect given to the inhabitants;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2000a|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it was in a very dilapidated state when seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE,&lt;ref name = PausX&gt;{{harvnb|Pausanias|1898|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, was undertaken by Emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of Abae,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bilco|1882|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these were confirmed by the Romans. The Persians did not reflect this opinion and would destroy all the temples that they overcame, Abae included. The Greek pledged to not rebuild them as a memorial of the ravages of the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2000a|p=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most exciting recent archaeological discoveries in Greece is the recognition that the sanctuary site near the modern village of [[Kalapodi]] is not only the site of the oracle of Apollon at Abae but that it was in constant use for cult practices from early [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] times to the Roman period. It is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion, which has been inferred from the [[List of Mycenaean deities|presence of the names]] of Classical Greek divinities on [[Linear B]] texts from [[Pylos]] and [[Knossos]].{{refn | group = nb |See reports of the excavations of the German Archaeological Institute in Archaeological Reports for 2008/9 43-45, Archaeological Reports for 2007/8 47-49, Archaeological Reports for 2006/7 41-43, Archaeological Reports for 2005/6 68-69, Archaeological Reports for 2004/5 55-56.}}

The fortified site described below, originally identified as Abae by Colonel [[William Leake]] in the 19th century, is much more likely to be that of the Sanctuary of Artemis at [[Hyampolis]].

The [[polygon]]al walls of the acropolis may still be seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill standing about {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the little plain of [[Exarcho]]; one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls below. The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the town. An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are a [[stoa]] and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the [[British School at Athens]] in 1894, but little was found.
