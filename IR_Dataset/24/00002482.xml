The '''Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|ɑːr|k|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|t|r|iː|ɒ|m|f|,_|-|_|ˈ|t|r|iː|oʊ|m|f}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Arc de Triomphe|accessdate=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/arc-de-triomphe|title=Arc de Triomphe|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|-|_|t|r|iː|ˈ|oʊ|m|f}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|arc de triomphe|accessdate=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|aʁk də tʁijɔ̃f də letwal|lang|Arc de Triomphe.oga|}}; {{literal translation|&quot;Triumphal Arch of the Star&quot;}}) is one of the most famous monuments in [[Paris]], [[France]], standing at the western end of the [[Champs-Élysées]] at the centre of [[Place Charles de Gaulle]], formerly named Place de l'Étoile—the ''étoile'' or &quot;star&quot; of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]], [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th]] (south and west), [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th]] (north) and [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th]] (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from [[World War I]].

As the central cohesive element of the ''[[Axe historique]]'' (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la Défense]]), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by [[Jean Chalgrin]] in 1806; its [[Iconography|iconographic]] programme pits [[Heroic nudity|heroically nude]] French youths against bearded [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors in [[mail (armour)|chain mail]]. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages. Inspired by the [[Arch of Titus]] in [[Rome]], Italy, the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of {{Convert|50|m|ft|0}}, width of {{Convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} and depth of {{Convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while its large vault is {{Convert|29.19|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|14.62|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. The smaller transverse vaults are {{Convert|18.68|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|8.44|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), [[Charles Godefroy]] flew his [[Nieuport]] biplane under the arch's primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.&lt;ref&gt;Melville Wallace, ''La vie d'un pilote de chasse en 1914–1918'', Flammarion, Paris, 1978. The film clip is included in The History Channel's ''Four Years of Thunder''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This film is thought still to be subject to copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Godefroy flight.jpg|Photograph of the first flight through the Arc]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris's Arc de Triomphe was the tallest [[triumphal arch]] until the completion of the [[Monumento a la Revolución]] in [[Mexico City]] in 1938, which is {{Convert|67|m|ft|0}} high. The [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang]], completed in 1982, is modelled on the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at {{Convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. [[La Grande Arche]] in La Defense near Paris is 110 metres high. Although it is not named an Arc de Triomphe, it has been designed on the same model and in the perspective of the Arc de Triomphe. It qualifies as the world's tallest arch.&lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/monument/arc-de-triomphe-facts.htm |title=Arc de Triomphe facts |author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Construction and late 19th century===
[[File:Collier's 1921 Vol 4 Frontispiece -- Paris.jpg|thumb|left|A colourised aerial photograph of the southern side (published in 1921)]]
The Arc de Triomphe is located on the right bank of the [[Seine]] at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon|Emperor Napoleon]] at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]] of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, [[Jean Chalgrin]], died in 1811 and the work was taken over by [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]].

[[File:Sylvestre Rude sur Arc de Triomphe 1893.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[François Rude]] working on the Arc de Triomphe'', 1893 painting by [[Joseph-Noël Sylvestre]]]]
During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], construction was halted and it would not be completed until the reign of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis-Philippe]], between 1833 and 1836, by the architects Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of [[Louis-Étienne Héricart de Thury|Héricart de Thury]]. On 15 December 1840, brought back to France from [[Saint Helena]], Napoleon's remains passed under it on their way to the Emperor's final resting place at the [[Invalides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.org/Musees/Invalides/ Hôtel des Invalides website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725104448/http://www.paris.org/Musees/Invalides/ |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to burial in the [[Panthéon]], the body of [[Victor Hugo]] was displayed under the Arc during the night of 22 May 1885.

===20th century===
[[File:Godefroy flight.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Godefroy]] flying through the Arc de Triomphe in 1919]]
[[File:Paris. Arc de Triomphe. Postcard, c.1920.jpg|thumb|Arc de Triomphe, postcard, circa 1920]]

[[File:Crowds of French patriots line the Champs Elysees-edit2.jpg|thumb|[[Free French]] forces on parade after the [[liberation of Paris]] (1944)]]
The sword carried by the ''Republic'' in the ''Marseillaise'' relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the [[Battle of Verdun]] began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by [[tarpaulin]]s to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.placesinfrance.com/history_arc_de_triomphe.html| title =History of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris |publisher =Places in France| accessdate = 28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 August 1919, [[Charles Godefroy]] successfully flew his biplane under the Arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=260&amp;d=441 |title=Les débuts de l'aviation : Charles Godefroy – L'Histoire par l'image |publisher=Histoire-image.org |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Navarre]] was the pilot who was tasked to make the flight, but he died on 10 July 1919 when he crashed near [[Villacoublay]] while training for the flight.

Following its construction, the Arc de Triomphe became the rallying point of French troops parading after successful military campaigns and for the annual [[Bastille Day military parade]]. Famous victory marches around or under the Arc have included the [[German Empire|Germans]] in 1871, the French in 1919, the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Germans]] in 1940, and the [[Liberation of Paris|French and Allies]] in 1944&lt;ref&gt;[http://pictopia.com/perl/get_image?size=457x275_mb&amp;provider_id=38&amp;ptp_photo_id=79689 Image of Liberation of Paris parade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011119/http://pictopia.com/perl/get_image?size=457x275_mb&amp;provider_id=38&amp;ptp_photo_id=79689 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1945. A United States [[postage stamp]] of 1945 shows the ''Arc de Triomphe'' in the background as victorious American troops march down the Champs-Élysées and U.S. airplanes fly overhead on 29 August 1944. After the interment of the Unknown Soldier, however, all military parades (including the aforementioned post-1919) have avoided marching through the actual arch. The route taken is up to the arch and then around its side, out of respect for the tomb and its symbolism. Both [[Hitler]] in 1940 and de Gaulle in 1944 observed this custom.

By the early 1960s, the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965–1966 it was cleaned through [[bleaching]]. In the prolongation of the [[Avenue des Champs-Élysées]], a new arch, the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la Défense]], was built in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris's ''Axe historique''. After the ''Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel'' and the ''Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile'', the ''Grande Arche'' is the third arch built on the same perspective.

In 1995, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria]] placed a bomb near the Arc de Triomphe which wounded 17 people as part of a [[1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings|campaign of bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/18/world/bomb-near-arc-de-triomphe-wounds-17.html |title=Bomb Near Arc De Triomphe wounds 17 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
In late 2018, the Arc de Triomphe suffered acts of vandalism as part of the [[Yellow vests movement]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Irish |first1=John |title=Macron mulls state of emergency after worst unrest in decades |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-protests/macron-visits-riot-damaged-arc-de-triomphe-state-of-emergency-mulled-idUKKBN1O1076 |website=Reuters |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monument===
[[File:Eugène Galien-Laloue Paris Arc de Triomphe 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Arc de Triomphe by [[Eugène Galien-Laloue]]]]
[[File:ParisPlaceEtoile.jpg|right|thumb|Avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe in [[Place Charles de Gaulle]], the former Place de l'Étoile.]]
[[File:Avenue des Champs-Élysées 01.jpg|thumb|right|The Arc de Triomphe is located on Paris's ''[[Axe historique]]'', a long perspective that runs from the [[Louvre]] to the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la Défense]].]]
The [[astylar]] design is by [[Jean Chalgrin]] (1739–1811), in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] version of ancient [[Roman architecture]]. Major [[Academy|academic]] sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the ''Arc de Triomphe'': [[Jean-Pierre Cortot]]; [[François Rude]]; [[Antoine Étex]]; [[James Pradier]] and [[Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire]]. The main sculptures are not integral [[frieze]]s but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast [[ashlar]] masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze [[appliqué]]s on [[Empire (style)|Empire furniture]]. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are ''The Triumph of 1810'' (Cortot), ''Resistance'' and ''Peace'' (both by Antoine Étex) and the most renowned of them all, ''Departure of the Volunteers of 1792'' commonly called ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' (François Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of [[Marshal of France]]. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing ''Peace'' is interpreted as commemorating the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Peace of 1815]].

In the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major French victories in the [[Wars of the French Revolution|French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro]] is inscribed as a French victory, instead of the tactical draw that it actually was.&lt;/ref&gt; The inside walls of [[Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe|the monument list the names of 660 people]], among which are 558 French generals of the [[First French Empire]];&lt;ref&gt;Among the generals are at least two foreign generals, Venezuelan [[Francisco de Miranda]] and German born [[Nicolas Luckner]].&lt;/ref&gt; The names of those generals killed in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major French victories in the Napoleonic Wars. The battles that took place in the period between the [[Hundred Days|departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo]] are not included.

For four years from 1882 to 1886, a monumental sculpture by [[Alexandre Falguière]] topped the arch.  Titled ''Le triomphe de la Révolution'' (&quot;The Triumph of the Revolution&quot;), it depicted a chariot drawn by horses preparing &quot;to crush Anarchy and Despotism&quot;. It remained there only four years before falling in ruins.

Inside the monument, a permanent exhibition conceived by the artist [[Maurice Benayoun]] and the architect Christophe Girault opened in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc-de-triomphe.org/ |title=Between War and Peace |accessdate=15 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216184504/http://arc-de-triomphe.org/ |archivedate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steel and new media installation interrogates the symbolism of the national monument, questioning the balance of its symbolic message during the last two centuries, oscillating between war and peace.

===Tomb of the Unknown Soldier===
[[File:Soldat inconnu 14 07 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] beneath the Arc de Triomphe]]
[[File:Secretary Kerry, French Foreign Minister Fabius, Ambassador Hartley Pause After 70th Anniversary VE Day Wreath-Laying Ceremony in Paris (17421255431).jpg|thumb|right|[[Laurent Fabius]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, with [[John Kerry]], U.S. Secretary of State, under the Arc de Triomphe in 2015]]
Beneath the Arc is the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from [[World War I]]. Interred on [[Armistice Day]] 1920,&lt;ref name=&quot;NaourAllen2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naour|first1=Jean-Yves Le|last2=Allen|first2=Penny|title=The Living Unknown Soldier: A Story of Grief and the Great War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3E3PRfQdBosC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=28 July 2011|date=16 August 2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8050-7937-1|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has the first [[eternal flame]] lit in Western and Eastern Europe since the [[Vestal Virgin]]s' fire was extinguished in the fourth century. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both world wars).

A ceremony is held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every 11 November on the anniversary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] signed by the Entente Powers and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided on 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the [[Panthéon]], but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top bears the inscription &lt;small&gt;ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRANÇAIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914–1918&lt;/small&gt; (&quot;Here lies a French soldier who died for the fatherland 1914–1918&quot;).

In 1961, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. After the 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]], Mrs Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband's grave at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.

==Details==
* The four main sculptural groups on each of the Arc's pillars are:
** ''Le Départ de 1792'' (or ''[[La Marseillaise]]''), by [[François Rude]]. The sculptural group celebrates the cause of the [[French First Republic]] during the [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August uprising]]. Above the volunteers is the winged personification of Liberty. This group served as a recruitment tool in the early months of [[World War I]] and encouraged the French to invest in war loans in 1915–1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Forrest | first =| title = The Legacy of the French Revolutionary Wars| publisher =Cambridge University Press| page = 38 | isbn =1139489240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Le Triomphe de 1810'', by [[Jean-Pierre Cortot]] celebrates the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]]. This group features [[Napoleon]], crowned by the goddess of Victory.
** ''La Résistance de 1814'', by [[Antoine Étex]] commemorates the French Resistance to the Allied Armies during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].
** ''La Paix de 1815'', by [[Antoine Étex]] commemorates the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], concluded in that year.

==Access==
[[File:World War I centenary.jpg|thumb|The Arc de Triomphe during the [[World War I centenary]] celebrations on 11 November 2018]]
The ''Arc de Triomphe'' is accessible by the [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] and [[Paris Métro|Métro]], with exit at the [[Charles de Gaulle - Étoile (Paris Métro and RER)|Charles de Gaulle—Étoile station]].  Because of heavy traffic on the roundabout of which the Arc is the centre, it is recommended that pedestrians use one of two underpasses located at the ''Champs Élysées'' and the ''Avenue de la Grande Armée''.  A lift will take visitors almost to the top – to the attic, where there is a small museum which contains large models of the Arc and tells its story from the time of its construction.
