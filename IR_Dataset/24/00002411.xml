'''A cappella''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|_|k|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|ə}}, &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|æ|_|-}}, {{IPA-it|a kapˈpɛlla|lang}}; {{langnf||Italian|&quot;in the manner of the chapel&quot;}})&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes spelled &quot;a capella&quot; from Latin) music is group or solo singing without [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] [[accompaniment]], or a piece intended to be performed in this way. The term ''a cappella'' was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt; The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for ''[[alla breve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious origins==
A cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Early Christian music was largely a cappella, although as noted by the Psalms some songs were accompanied by string instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music in ancient Judaism and early Christianity|last=Smith|first= John Arthur|isbn=978-1409421610|location=Farnham, Surrey|oclc=715159344}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used. [By definition, Christianity began with the New Testament.]|date=November 2013}} and this practice has continued in both of these religions as well as in Islam.

===Christian===
The [[polyphony]] of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century AD, with compositions by [[Josquin des Prez]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument&lt;!--Which instrument? A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--&gt; would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ &quot;doubling&quot; some or all of the voices.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.

Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Schütz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Byzantine Rite====
In the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, &quot;The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ware&gt;{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorovïye kontsertï'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.

====Opposition to instruments in worship====
Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include many [[Anabaptist]] communities (such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]), some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Reformed Free Methodist Church|Reformed Free Methodists]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones1974&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Charles Edwin |title=A guide to the study of the holiness movement |date=1974 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810807037 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 685] |language=English |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doukhobor]]s, and the [[Byzantine Rite]] of Eastern Christianity. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.

Opponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%13:15;%20James%205:13;&amp;version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.&lt;ref name=kurfees&gt;{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.&lt;ref name=McKinnon&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bales&gt;{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group=&quot;nb&quot;|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in &quot;Christianity&quot;. Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (c. 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Christians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.

The first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.&lt;ref&gt;American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=&quot;nb&quot;|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Instruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546),&lt;ref name=M&amp;S&gt;{{harvnb|M'Clintock|Strong|1894|p=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564)&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791).&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1844|p=684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as &quot;a cow bell in a concert&quot;.&lt;ref name=ferg&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|2004|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'', the heroine, [[Jeanie Deans]], a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):
:The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some '''[[kirk]]s without organs that are like ours''', and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acceptance of instruments in worship====
Those who do not adhere to the [[regulative principle]] of interpreting Christian scripture, believe that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.

Those who subscribe to this interpretation believe that since the Christian scriptures never counter instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (33–180 AD).&lt;ref name=McKinnon2&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves.&lt;ref name=McKinnon3&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God's desire for the church,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.
* Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard playing religious music. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.&lt;ref name=McKinnon3/&gt; Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is believed that &quot;the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=52, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern opponents of instruments typically do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,{{refn|group=&quot;nb&quot;|Rather than calling the use of instruments &quot;evil&quot;, modern opposition typically uses terms like &quot;unspiritual&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an Old Testament &quot;shadow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|Lewis|West|1984|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} who argued that God had allowed David the &quot;evil&quot; of using musical instruments in praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Old Testament teaches that God specifically asked for musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern concern is for worship based on the New Testament.

Since &quot;a cappella&quot; singing brought a new polyphony (more than one note at a time) with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Zwingli was destroying organs in Switzerland&amp;nbsp;– Luther called him a fanatic&amp;nbsp;– the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Holiness Churches]] such as the [[Free Methodist Church]] opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955. The [[Reformed Free Methodist Church]] and [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]] were formed as a result of a schism with the Free Methodist Church, with the former retaining a cappella worship and the latter retaining the rule limiting the number of instruments in the church to the piano and organ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones1974&quot;/&gt;

===Jewish===
While worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25–29:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shircago&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that &quot;silent singing&quot; (without even vocal chords) was better still.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}). The [[shofar]] is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1967|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is only used from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Elul]] through the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alleman|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, silver [[trumpet]]s, as described in {{bibleverse|Numbers|10:1-10}}, have been made in recent years and used in prayer services at the [[Western Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/silver-trumpets-pierce-the-heavens-in-prayer-rally-opposite-temple-mount/2016/03/23/ |title=Silver Trumpets Pierce the Heavens in Prayer Rally Opposite Temple Mount |date=23 March 2016|website=JewishPress.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Christian Lutkin, dean of the [[Bienen School of Music|Northwestern University School of Music]], helped popularize a cappella music in the United States by founding the Northwestern A Cappella Choir in 1906. The A Cappella Choir was &quot;the first permanent organization of its kind in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wittman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Camp|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An a cappella tradition was begun in 1911 by [[F. Melius Christiansen]], a music faculty member at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name='Norwegian Americans'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Norwegian Americans |encyclopedia=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life |edition=3rd |pages=477–481 |volume=2 |section=Americas |location=Farmington Hills, Michigan |publisher=Gale |year=2017 |via=[[Minneapolis Community &amp; Technical College]] Library |access-date=24 September 2018 |url=http://link.galegroup.com.mctproxy.mnpals.net/apps/doc/CX3648200207/GVRL?u%3Dmnaminncom&amp;amp;sid%3DGVRL&amp;amp;xid%3Dcecfcc81 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Olaf Choir|St. Olaf College Choir]] was established as an outgrowth of the local [[St. John's Lutheran Church (Northfield, Minnesota)|St. John's Lutheran Church]], where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed, at least partially, of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus. The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors, and a tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]] (Moorhead, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] (Rock Island, Illinois), [[Wartburg College]] (Waverly, Iowa), [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] (Decorah, Iowa), [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] (St. Peter, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]] (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), and [[Augsburg University]] (Minneapolis, Minnesota). The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend, intonation, phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Prieto|first=Pilar|chapter=The intonational phonology of Catalan |date=2014|pages=43–80|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199567300|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199567300.003.0003|title=Prosodic Typology II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.van.org/choirauditions.htm|title=Vocal Area Network Choir Auditions|website=www.van.org|access-date=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements in modern a cappella over the past century include [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] and [[doo wop]]. The [[Barbershop Harmony Society]], [[Sweet Adelines International]], and Harmony Inc. host educational events including Harmony University, Directors University, and the International Educational Symposium, and international contests and conventions, recognizing international champion [[List of chorus champions by year|choruses]] and [[List of quartet champions by year|quartets]].

Many a cappella groups can be found in high schools and colleges. There are amateur Barbershop Harmony Society and professional groups that sing a cappella exclusively. Although a cappella is technically defined as singing without instrumental accompaniment, some groups use their voices to emulate instruments; others are more traditional and focus on harmonizing. A cappella styles range from gospel music to contemporary to barbershop quartets and choruses.

The [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]] (CASA) is a membership option for former students, whose funds support hosted competitions and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schluntz|first=Roger L.|date=1982|title=Design Competitions: For Whose Benefit Now?|journal=JAE|volume=35|issue=4|pages=2–9|doi=10.2307/1424700|issn=0149-2993|jstor=1424700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.music.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1059:the-contemporary-a-cappella-society-casa&amp;catid=109&amp;Itemid=101|title=The Contemporary A Cappella Society (CASA)|website=www.music.org|access-date=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cappella music was popularized between the late 2000s and the early to mid-2010s with media hits such as the 2009–2014 TV show ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' and the musical comedy film series ''[[Pitch Perfect (film series)|Pitch Perfect]]''.

===Recording artists===
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}
In [[Number-one hits of 1943 (United States)|July 1943]], as a result of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] boycott of US recording studios, the a cappella vocal group ''The Song Spinners'' had a best-seller with &quot;Comin' In on a Wing and a Prayer&quot;. In the 1950s, several recording groups, notably [[The Hi-Los]] and the [[Four Freshmen]], introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The [[King's Singers]] are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s. Frank Zappa loves Doo wop and A cappella, so Zappa released [[The Persuasions]]' first album from his label in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trunkworthy.com/the-persuasions-frank-zappas-pitch-perfect-gift-to-a-cappella-harmony/ |publisher=Trunkworthy |access-date=2 December 2017 |title=The Persuasions: Frank Zappa's Pitch Perfect Gift to a Cappella Harmony }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, an a cappella group known as [[The Flying Pickets]] had a Christmas 'number one' in the UK with a cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s (known in the US as [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]]) &quot;[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]&quot;. A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late 1980s onward, spurred by the success of Top 40 recordings by artists such as [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[All-4-One]], [[The Nylons]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[*NSYNC]].{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Contemporary a cappella includes many vocal groups and bands who add [[vocal percussion]] or [[beatboxing]] to create a pop/rock/gospel sound, in some cases very similar to bands with instruments. Examples of such professional groups include [[Straight No Chaser (group)|Straight No Chaser]], [[Pentatonix]], [[The House Jacks]], [[Rockapella]], [[Mosaic (vocal band)|Mosaic]], [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] and [[M-pact]]. There also remains a strong a cappella presence within Christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship. Examples of such groups are [[Take 6]], [[Glad (band)|Glad]] and [[Acappella (group)|Acappella]]. Arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles typically include one voice singing the lead melody, one singing a rhythmic bass line, and the remaining voices contributing chordal or [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] accompaniment.

A cappella can also describe the isolated vocal track(s) from a [[multitrack recording]] that originally included instrumentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These vocal tracks may be [[remix]]ed or put onto vinyl records for DJs, or released to the public so that fans can remix them. One such example is the a cappella release of [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|Black Album]]'', which [[Danger Mouse (artist)|Danger Mouse]] mixed with [[The Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' to create ''[[The Grey Album]]''.

On their 1966 album titled ''Album'', Peter, Paul and Mary included the song &quot;Norman Normal.&quot; All the sounds on that song, both vocals and instruments, were created by Paul's voice, with no actual instruments used.&lt;ref&gt;Stookey, Paul. Liner Notes. ''The Peter, Paul, and Mary Album''. Warner Bros Record, 1966. Vinyl.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an artist by the name [[Smooth McGroove]] rose to prominence with his style of a cappella music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futter|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his a cappella covers of [[video game]] music tracks on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilliard|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, an a cappella version of Jerusalem by multi-instrumentalist [[Jacob Collier]] was selected for [[Beats Electronics|Beats by Dre]] &quot;The Game Starts Here&quot;  for the [[England at the Rugby World Cup|England Rugby World Cup]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/england-rugby-captain-stars-beats-dre-campaign/1364614|title=England rugby captain stars in Beats By Dre campaign|access-date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-gOvn67d_8|title=Jerusalem – Jacob Collier (Soundtrack for Beats by Dre: &quot;The Game Starts Here&quot;)|access-date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
A cappella has been used as the sole orchestration for original works of [[musical theatre]] that have had commercial runs [[Off-Broadway]] (theatres in New York City with 99 to 500 seats) only four times. The first was Avenue X which opened on 28 January 1994 and ran for 77 performances. It was produced by [[Playwrights Horizons]] with book by John Jiler, music and lyrics by Ray Leslee. The musical style of the show's score was primarily [[Doo-Wop]] as the plot revolved around Doo-Wop group singers of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[The Kinsey Sicks]], produced and starred in the critically acclaimed [[off-Broadway]] hit, &quot;DRAGAPELLA! Starring the Kinsey Sicks&quot; at New York's legendary [[Studio 54]]. That production received a nomination for a [[Lucille Lortel]] award as Best Musical and a Drama Desk nomination for Best Lyrics. It was directed by Glenn Casale with original music and lyrics by Ben Schatz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The a cappella musical [[Perfect Harmony (musical)|Perfect Harmony]], a comedy about two high school a cappella groups vying to win the National championship, made its Off Broadway debut at Theatre Row's Acorn Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City in October 2010 after a successful out-of-town run at the Stoneham Theatre, in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Perfect Harmony features the hit music of The Jackson 5, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, Marvin Gaye, Scandal, Tiffany, The Romantics, The Pretenders, The Temptations, The Contours, The Commodores, Tommy James &amp; the Shondells and The Partridge Family, and has been compared to a cross between [[Altar Boyz]] and [[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkle|Bacalzo|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth a cappella musical to appear Off-Broadway, In Transit, premiered 5 October 2010 and was produced by [[Primary Stages]] with book, music, and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez, James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan, and Sara Wordsworth. Set primarily in the New York City subway system its score features an eclectic mix of musical genres (including jazz, hip hop, Latin, rock, and country). In Transit incorporates vocal beat boxing into its contemporary a cappella arrangements through the use of a subway beat boxer character. Beat boxer and actor [[Chesney Snow]] performed this role for the 2010 Primary Stages production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the show's website, it is scheduled to reopen for an open-ended commercial run in the Fall of 2011. In 2011, the production received four Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Musical, Outer Critics Circle and Drama League nominations, as well as five Drama Desk nominations including Outstanding Musical and won for Outstanding Ensemble Performance.

In December 2016, In Transit became the first a cappella musical on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/in-transit-new-a-cappella-musical-opens-on-broadway |magazine=[[Playbill]] |date=11 December 2016|first=Andrew |last=Gans |title=In Transit, New A Cappella Musical, Opens on Broadway |quote=In Transit, Broadway's first a cappella musical, officially opens December 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbershop style===
{{main|Barbershop music}}
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}
[[Barbershop music]] is one of several uniquely American art forms. The earliest reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans. The earliest documented quartets all began in [[barber]] shops. In 1938, the first formal men's barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A), and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] (BHS). Today the BHS has about 22,000 members in approximately 800 chapters across the United States and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lakegeorgeexaminer.com/barbershop-harmony-society-keep-whole-world-singing-lake-george/ |newspaper=The Lake George Examiner |date=19 April 2017 |access-date=2 December 2017 |title=Barbershop Harmony Society to 'keep the whole world singing' in Lake George |first=Gillian |last=Burdett |quote=the Society has 22,000 members }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnecd.com/blog/36/finding-harmony-in-nashville |publisher=Tennessee Department of Economic &amp; Community Development |date=13 July 2015 |access-date=2 December 2017 |website=tnecd.com |quote=800 chapters across the U.S. and Canada |title=Finding Harmony in Nashville }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the barbershop style has spread around the world with organizations in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbershop.org/about-us/affiliates/ |title=Barbershop is universal; here are the contacts for our official affiliates |access-date=2 December 2017 |publisher=Barbershop Harmony Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barbershop Harmony Society provides a highly organized competition structure for a cappella quartets and choruses singing in the barbershop style.

In 1945, the first formal women's barbershop organization, Sweet Adelines, was formed. In 1953, Sweet Adelines became an international organization, although it didn't change its name to [[Sweet Adelines International]] until 1991. The membership of nearly 25,000 women, all singing in English, includes choruses in most of the fifty United States as well as in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses.

In 1959, a second women's barbershop organization started as a break off from Sweet Adelines due to ideological differences. Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, [http://www.harmonyinc.org Harmony, Inc.] is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.

===Amateur and high school===
The popularity of a cappella among high schools and amateurs was revived by television shows and movies such as ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and ''[[Pitch Perfect (film series)|Pitch Perfect]]''. High school groups may have conductors or student leaders who keep the tempo for the group, or beatboxers/vocal percussionists.

==In other countries==

===Pakistan===
The musical show ''Strepsils Stereo'' is credited for introducing the art of a cappella in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1178175 |title=Strepsils Stereo brings A Capella to Pakistan for the first time |work=Dawn |date=11 August 2017 |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
Composer [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] became the first [[Sri Lanka]]n to write a cappella pieces for [[SATB]] choirs. He wrote &quot;The Princes of the Lost Tribe&quot; and &quot;Ancient Queen of Somawathee&quot; for Menaka De Shabandu and Bridget Helpe's choirs, respectively, based on historical incidents in ancient Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chanmugam|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perera|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice Print is also a professional a cappella music group in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.music.lk/showcase.php?search_keyword=voice+print&amp;button=Search|title=Searching for Songs and Music Videos – voice print|date=4 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004185445/http://www.music.lk/showcase.php?search_keyword=voice+print&amp;button=Search|archive-date=4 October 2016|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}
The European a cappella tradition is especially strong in the countries around the Baltic and perhaps most so in Sweden as described by [[Richard Sparks]] in his doctoral thesis ''The Swedish Choral Miracle'' in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCM&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sparks|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish a cappella choirs have over the last 25 years won around 25% of the annual prestigious [[European Grand Prix for Choral Singing]] (EGP) that despite its name is open to choirs from all over the world (see list of laureates in the Wikipedia article on the EGP competition).

The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition, an unusually large proportion of the populations (5% is often cited) regularly sing in choirs, the Swedish choral director [[Eric Ericson]] had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world, and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools ('music schools') with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day, a system that started with [[Adolf Fredrik's Music School]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1939 but has spread over the country.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Oxfordalternotives.jpg|thumb|[[The Oxford Alternotives]], the oldest a cappella group at the University of Oxford in the UK]]
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:University of Exeter's Sweet Nothings.jpg|thumb|The Sweet Nothings are one of the University of Exeter's eight a cappella groups. They are one of the oldest and most successful girl groups in the UK]]
A cappella has gained attention in the UK in recent years, with many groups forming at British universities by students seeking an alternative singing pursuit to traditional choral and chapel singing. This movement has been bolstered by organisations such as [[The Voice Festival UK]].
The Other Guys are Scotland's premiere All-Male A Capella Group.

==Collegiate==
{{main|Collegiate a cappella|List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the UK}}
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}
It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://issuu.com/tcdigitalrepository/docs/2014spring |magazine=Trinity Reporter |date=Spring 2014 |page=18|title=Perfect Harmony |via=issu.com |quote=founded in the 19th century |first=Jim H. |last=Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=RPI glee club founding year not specified}} However the longest continuously-singing group is probably [[The Whiffenpoofs]] of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was formed in 1909 and once included [[Cole Porter]] as a member.&lt;ref name=Yale /&gt; Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include [[Colgate University]]'s [[The Colgate Thirteen|The Colgate 13]] (1942), [[Dartmouth College]]'s Aires (1946), [[Cornell University]]'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the [[University of Maine]] Maine Steiners (1958), the [[Columbia University]] Kingsmen (1949), the [http://www.jabberwocks.com Jabberwocks] of [[Brown University]] (1949), and the [[University of Rochester]] YellowJackets (1956).

All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a [[parody]] of the men's groups: the [[Smiffenpoofs]] of [[Smith College]] (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and [[The Chattertocks of Brown University]] (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]]. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/&quot;[[beatboxing]]&quot;. Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]]. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including [[John Legend]], an alumnus of the Counterparts at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. [[Mira Sorvino]] is an alumna of [[the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones]] of [[Harvard College]], where she had the solo on [[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]] by [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]].

A cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. The first South Asian a cappella group was [[Penn Masala]], founded in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining in popularity. The first co-ed south Asian a cappella was Anokha, from the [[University of Maryland]], formed in 2001. Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the &quot;Anahat&quot; competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts &quot;Sa Re Ga Ma Pella&quot;, an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.

Jewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.

Each year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&amp;nbsp;– which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&amp;nbsp;– and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, &quot;BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488–502|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.125.498.0488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=4 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emulating instruments==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
In addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, &quot;[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]&quot; by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.

The [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s &quot;[[Don't Stop Believin']]&quot;, [[The Beach Boys]]' &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot; and [[Michael Jackson]]'s &quot;[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]&quot;.

Christian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song &quot;Plead the Fifth&quot; a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.
