He is known for his textbook writings on [[microeconomics]] and the libertarian theory of [[anarcho-capitalism]], which is the subject of his most popular book, ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Caplan|first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Caplan |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Friedman, David (1945– ) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n117 |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA  |isbn= 978-1412965804 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=194–95 |quote= |ref= |chapter=Friedman, David (1945-) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides ''The Machinery of Freedom'', he has authored several other books and articles, including ''Price Theory: An Intermediate Text'' (1986), ''Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters'' (2000), ''Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life'' (1996), and ''Future Imperfect'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Free Market Mojo.

==Life and work==
David Friedman is the son of economists [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. He graduated ''magna cum laude'' from [[Harvard University]] in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ Faculty Profile: David Friedman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722163211/http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ |date=2014-07-22 }}. Santa Clara Law School&lt;/ref&gt; He later earned a master's (1967) and a [[Ph.D.]] (1971) in theoretical physics from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Academic.html|title=My Academic Page|website=www.daviddfriedman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Athiparambath|first1=Shanu|title=Economist David Friedman Says India Must Go Taller To Make Homes Affordable|url=http://marketurbanism.com/2016/02/14/economist-david-friedman-says-india-must-go-taller-to-make-homes-affordable/|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=Market Urbanism|date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a professor of law at [[Santa Clara University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonebook.scu.edu/?v=pid&amp;i=462|title=Santa Clara University|first=Santa Clara|last=University|website=phonebook.scu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a contributing editor for ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine. He is an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David D. [http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/01/atheism-and-religion.html &quot;Atheism and Religion&quot;], ''Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Patri Friedman]], has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly [[seasteading]].

===''The Machinery of Freedom''===
{{Main|The Machinery of Freedom}}
In his book ''The Machinery of Freedom'' (1973), Friedman sketched a form of [[anarcho-capitalism]] where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the [[free market]].  Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual [[privatization]] of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing the law itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|pages=[https://archive.org/details/machineryoffreed00frie/page/149 149–150]|chapter=Revolution Is the Hell of It|author=Friedman, David D|isbn=0-8126-9069-9|year=1995|url=https://archive.org/details/machineryoffreed00frie/page/149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocates a [[Consequentialist libertarianism|consequentialist]] version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of state versus no state.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Christopher. 1992. An Essay on the Modern State. Cambridge University Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with the [[Natural-rights libertarianism|natural-rights]] approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist [[Murray Rothbard]].

==Non-academic interests==
Friedman is a longtime member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], where he is known as ''Duke Cariadoc of the Bow''. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Restructuring.html|title=Friedman, David D. &quot;On Restructuring the SCA&quot;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is compiled in the popular ''Cariadoc's Miscellany''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/miscellany.html|title=Cariadoc's Miscellany|website=www.pbm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the [[Pennsic War]]; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Watkins (Fólki Þorgilsson). 2005. ''HERSTAĐR-SAGA: An Incomplete History of Pennsic'' Urbana, Illinois: Folump Enterprises&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a long-time [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan]], and has written two [[fantasy]] novels, ''Harald'' ([[Baen Books]], 2006) and ''Salamander'' (2011).

He has spoken in favor of a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO1xXD1Cws4|title=Dr David Friedman on US Foreign Policy, Syria, Assad, Terrorism, WWII, Hitler, and much more...|last=VoluntaryVirtues0com|date=22 September 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
