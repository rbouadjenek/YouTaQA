{{History of Latvia}}
[[File:CoA Riga Archbishopric.svg|thumb|Coat of Arms]]
The '''Archbishopric of Riga''' ({{lang-la|Archiepiscopatus Rigensis}}, {{lang-nds|Erzbisdom Riga}}) was an [[archbishop]]ric in [[Terra Mariana|Medieval Livonia]], a subject to the [[Holy See]]. It was established in 1186 as the bishopric of [[Livonia]] at [[Ikšķile]], then after moving to [[Riga]] it became the bishopric of Riga in 1202 and was elevated to an archbishopric in 1255.

== Archbishops of Riga ==

The archbishops of Riga were also the secular rulers of [[Riga]] until 1561 when during the [[reformation]] the territory converted from [[Catholicism]] to [[Lutheranism]] and all church territories were secularized. The [[Episcopal see|see]] was restored as a [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in 1918 and raised into an archdiocese in 1923.

A new [[Diocese of Inflanty|Bishopric of Livonia]] was established in [[Latgalia]] in 1621 during the [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

== Coinage ==

The Archbishops of Riga were innovators in the field of [[Mint (coin)|minting]] currency, reviving techniques abandoned since the collapse of Rome. The names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on Livonian [[penny|pennies]] excavated at archaeological sites. In many cases, this is the only biographical data available. No Livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.
