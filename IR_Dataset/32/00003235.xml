'''Albert Frederick''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht Friedrich}}; {{lang-pl|Albrecht Fryderyk}}; 7 May 1553 &amp;ndash; 28 August 1618) was the [[Duke of Prussia]], from 1568 until his death.  He was a son of [[Albert of Prussia]] and [[Anna Marie of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. He was the second and last Prussian duke of the [[Ansbach]] branch of the [[Hohenzollern]] family.

==Duke of Prussia==
Albert became Duke of Prussia after paying [[Homage (feudal)|feudal homage]] to his cousin, the [[King of Poland]], [[Zygmunt August]], on July 19, 1569 in [[Lublin]].&lt;ref name=Lancizolle&gt;{{cite book|last=Carl Wilhelm von Lancizolle|title=Geschichte der Bildung des preussischen Staats. Erster Theil, Volumes 1-2|year=1828|publisher=Nicolaischen Buchhandlung|location=Berlin and Stettin|pages=474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MN4rAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA474}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The homage was described by the Polish chronicler [[Jan Kochanowski]] in his work ''Proporzec'' (&quot;Standard&quot;). During the 1573 Polish election, Albert Frederick attempted to gain acceptance to the Polish [[senate]] but was opposed by the powerful [[Jan Zamoyski]] (later Grand [[Hetman]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]) who feared the influence of [[Protestants]] in the Polish legislative body. Albert Frederick initially refused to recognize the election of [[Stefan Bathory]] and supported the candidacy of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]]. However, at the [[Toruń]] [[sejm]] of October 1576 he gave his support to the new monarch.

As the great grandson of the Polish king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], and as a Duke in Prussia who was fluent in Polish, Albert Frederick was seriously considered for a time as a possible candidate for the Polish throne. He particularly enjoyed the support of Polish [[Lutherans]].

In 1572 he began to exhibit signs of mental disorder. In early 1578, the regency was taken over by his cousin, [[George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George Frederick of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] (1539–1603). After George Frederick's death in 1603, the Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] appointed [[Joachim III Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim Frederick]] as regent in 1605, and permitted his son, [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]], to succeed him in 1611. The latter became Duke of Prussia after Albert Frederick's death in 1618.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Daniel|title=A History of East Central Europe|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295980935|pages=143|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&amp;pg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Albert Frederick was married in 1573 to [[Marie Eleonore of Cleves]], a daughter of [[Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] and [[Maria of Habsburg, Archduchess of Austria|Archduchess Maria of Austria]] (1531&amp;ndash;1581). Maria was a daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]].

==Issue==
Albert Frederick and Marie were parents to seven children:
# [[Duchess Anna of Prussia|Anna of Prussia]] (3 July 1576 &amp;ndash; 30 August 1625). Married [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]].
# [[Marie of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Marie of Prussia]] (23 January 1579 &amp;ndash; 21 February 1649). Married [[Christian, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]].
# Albert Frederick of Prussia (1 June 1580 &amp;ndash; 8 October 1580).
# [[Duchess Sophie of Prussia|Sophie of Prussia]] (31 March 1582 &amp;ndash; 4 December 1610). Married [[Wilhelm Kettler]] of [[Courland]].
# [[Eleanor of Prussia]] (22 August 1583 &amp;ndash; 31 March/9 April 1607). Married [[Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg]].
# Wilhelm Frederick of Prussia (23 June 1585 &amp;ndash; 18 January 1586).
# [[Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia]] (31 December 1586 &amp;ndash; 22 February 1659). Married [[John George I, Elector of Saxony]].

At his death, the duchy passed to his son-in-law [[John Sigismund, Margrave of Brandenburg]], combining the two territories under a single dynasty and forming [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].
