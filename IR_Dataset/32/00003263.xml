'''Acid rain''' is a [[rain]] or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is unusually [[acid]]ic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low [[pH]]). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]], which react with the [[Properties of water|water molecules]] in the [[atmosphere]] to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]]. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, [[corrosion]] of steel structures such as bridges, and [[weathering]] of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

==Definition==
&quot;Acid rain&quot; is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a [[pH]] greater than 7 are alkaline. &quot;Clean&quot; or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid according to the following reaction:

:{{Chemical formula|H2O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula |CO2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} ([[Aqueous solution|aq]])

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[carbonate]] and [[hydronium]] ions:

:{{Chemical formula|H2O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

Unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is [[nitric acid]] produced by [[electric discharge]] in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/JD092iD11p13299|author1=Likens, Gene E. |author2=Keene, William C. |author3=Miller, John M. |author4=Galloway, James N. |title=Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia|year=1987|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=92|issue=D11 |page=13299 |bibcode=1987JGR....9213299L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid deposition as an [[environmental issue]] (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids other than {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}}.

The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local [[pollution]] has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Likens, G.

The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook]] Valley. In 1972, a group of scientists including [[Gene Likens]] discovered the rain that was deposited at [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Likens|first=Gene E.|last2=Bormann|first2=F.

Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species' behaviors. There was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the [[food web]] complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ronald J.|last2=Likens|first2=Gene E.|last3=Fiance|first3=Sandy B.|last4=Hendrey|first4=George R.|date=August 1, 1980|title=Experimental Acidification of a Stream in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=976–989|doi=10.2307/1936765|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1936765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the US Congress passed an [[Acid Deposition Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lackey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/staff/lackey/pubs/ACID-RAIN-SCIENCE-POLICY-LACKEY-BLAIR-JOURNAL-REPRINT-1997.pdf |author =Lackey, R.T. |year=1997|title= Science, policy, and acid rain: lessons learned|journal= Renewable Resources Journal|volume= 15|issue=1|pages= 9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lackey&quot; /&gt;  For the US Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1462-9011(98)00006-9|title=Acid rain: Science and policy making|year=1998|last1=Winstanley|first1=Derek|last2=Lackey|first2=Robert T.|last3=Warnick|first3=Walter L.|last4=Malanchuk|first4=John|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=1|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislation that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/18/us/legislators-sat-white-house-suppressed-acid-rain-report.html|title=LEGISLATORS SAT WHITE HOUSE SUPPRESSED ACID RAIN REPORT|last=Franklin|first=Ben A.|date=August 18, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the US [[National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program]] (NAPAP) provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The US National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program : 1990 integrated assessment report. Washington, D.C. : National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Office of the Director, [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support [[Brook Trout]], and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent ''Reports to Congress'' have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1990, the US Congress passed a series of amendments to the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-title-iv-subchapter-acid-deposition-control |title=Clean Air Act Title IV - Subchapter A: Acid Deposition Control &amp;#124; Overview of the Clean Air Act and Air Pollution &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= June 3, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IV of these amendments established the a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/air.pdf “Cleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. September 2017. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power plants, close to a 50% reduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Environmental Protection Agency&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |date=2002 |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214841/http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |archivedate=September 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&amp;hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp |title=Facts On File News Services Databases |publisher=2facts.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional regulation was used in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Gilberston, T. and Reyes, O. 2009.

In 2007, total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;/&gt; Forbes says: &quot;In 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W.

The term [[citizen science]] can be traced back as far as January 1989 and a campaign by the [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]] to measure acid rain. Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]] entitled 'Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by R. Kerson in the magazine [[MIT Technology Review]] from January 1989.&lt;ref name=1stUse&gt;{{cite web|author=Muki Haklay|title=Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=11|date=2015|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson&gt;{{cite magazine|author=R. Kerson|title=Lab for the Environment|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=1989|volume=92|issue=1|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from the Wilson Center report: &quot;The new form of engagement in science received the name &quot;citizen science&quot;. The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. The volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon.&quot;&lt;ref name=1stUse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson/&gt;

==Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification==
The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7–8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berresheim 1995&quot;&gt;Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D.

Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from the Laguna Caliente crater of [[Poás Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements. Acid-producing gasses are also created by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulfur compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].

Nitric acid in [[rain]]water is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/63065-acid-rain.html|title=Acid Rain: Causes, Effects and Solutions|date=July 14, 2018|website=|access-date=August 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Likens, G. E. 1979&quot;/&gt;

Soils of [[coniferous forests]] are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

===Human activity===
{{See also|Nitrogen cycle|Human impact on the nitrogen cycle|sulfur cycle}}[[File:Gavin Power Plant.jpg|thumb|The coal-fired [[Gavin Power Plant]] in [[Cheshire, Ohio]]]]
The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]], [[Environmental impact of meat production|animal agriculture]], factories, and [[motor vehicle]]s. Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollution responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.

==Chemical processes==
Combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAA01&quot;&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', September 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas phase chemistry===
In the [[gas phase]] sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl radical]] via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:&lt;ref name=&quot;Seinfeld 1998&quot;/&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·
which is followed by:
:HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
In the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid]]:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:
[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&amp;Effects.svg|thumb|This shows the process of the air pollution being released into the atmosphere and the areas that will be affected.]]
:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.

;Hydrolysis

Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions that [[redox|oxidize]] sulfur from S([[oxidation state|IV]]) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by [[iron]] and [[manganese]] in the cloud droplets).&lt;ref name=&quot;Seinfeld 1998&quot;/&gt;

==Acid deposition==

===Wet deposition===
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===
Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |title=UK National Air Quality Archive: Air Pollution Glossary |publisher=Airquality.co.uk |date=April 1, 2002 |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417054802/http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |archivedate=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

===Surface waters and aquatic animals===
[[File:Waterspecies.gif|thumb|Not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout.]]
Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pH lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pH can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the [[brook trout]] in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html Effects of Acid Rain – Surface Waters and Aquatic Animals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: &quot;Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;/&gt; Lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition (i.e. marble) due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals, even with the same amount of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mineral Resources, Economics and the Environment.|last=Kesler|first=Stephen|publisher=Cambridge University|year=2015|isbn=9781107074910|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Soils===
[[Soil biology]] and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhe, H., et al. The global distribution of acidifying wet deposition. Environmental Science and TEchnology. vlo. 36, no. 20 (October) p.&amp;nbsp;4382–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[enzyme]]s of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s, such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA: Forests&quot;&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html Effects of Acid Rain – Forests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726034352/http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html |date=July 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as [[sugar maple]] ([[Acer saccharum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The biogeochemistry of sulfur at Hubbard Brook|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/BioGeo60.235.316.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1020972100496|year=2002|last1=Likens|first1=G.E.|last2=Driscoll|first2=C.T.|last3=Buso|first3=D.C.|last4=Mitchell|first4=M.J.|last5=Lovett|first5=G.M.|last6=Bailey|first6=S.W.|last7=Siccama|first7=T.G.|last8=Reiners|first8=W.A.|last9=Alewell|first9=C.|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=60|issue=3|page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.244|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/Sci.272.244.246.pdf|title=Long-Term Effects of Acid Rain: Response and Recovery of a Forest Ecosystem|year=1996|last1=Likens|first1=G.

===Forests and other vegetation===
[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|thumb|Acid rain can have severe effects on vegetation. A forest in the [[Black Triangle (region)|Black Triangle]] in Europe.]]
Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.&lt;ref&gt;DeHayes, D.H., Schaberg, P.G. and G.R. Strimbeck.

===Ocean acidification===
{{main|Ocean acidification}}
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}
Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans. Acid rain can cause the ocean's pH to fall, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their [[exoskeleton]]s that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/headline_universe/olpa/acid_coasts_7sept07.html|title=Acid Rain Has Disproportionate Impact on Near-Shore Ocean Waters - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the [[calcium carbonate]], core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.

===Human health effects===
Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. The particulates responsible for acid rain (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air contribute to heart and lung problems including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html Effects of Acid Rain – Human Health]. Epa.gov (June 2, 2006). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|Effect of acid rain on statues|thumb|right]]
[[File:Skulptur aus Sandstein, Dresden 2012-09-06-0555.jpg|Acid rain and weathering|thumb|right]]
Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as [[limestone]] and [[marble]], that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) {{eqm}} CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the [[corrosion]] rate of metals, in particular [[iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ICP on effects on materials |doi=10.1007/BF01186242 |volume=85 |issue=4 |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |pages=2701–2706|bibcode=1995WASP...85.2701R |last1=Reisener |first1=A. |last2=Stäckle |first2=B. |last3=Snethlage |first3=R. |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |title=Approaches in modeling the impact of air pollution-induced material degradation |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175635/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention methods==

===Technical solutions===
Many coal-firing [[power station]]s use [[flue-gas desulfurization]] (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral [[calcium sulfate]] that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. The effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.

[[Fluidized bed combustion]] also reduces the amount of sulfur emitted by power production.

[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

===International treaties===
International treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

===Emissions trading===
{{main|Emissions trading}}
{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}
In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651&lt;/ref&gt; is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.
