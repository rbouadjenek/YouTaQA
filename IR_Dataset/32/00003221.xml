'''Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Nami''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أحمد بن عبد الله النعمي, {{transl|ar|''Aḥmad bin ‘Abdullāh an-Nāmī''}}; also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alnami'''; August 17, 1977 – September 11, 2001) was one of four [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], Nami had served as a [[muezzin]] and was a college student. He left his family in 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but later went to [[Afghanistan]] bound for an [[al-Qaeda]] training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.

He arrived in the [[United States]] in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in [[Florida]] up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, Nami boarded [[United Airlines Flight 93|United 93]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]].

==History==
Nami, much like [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], [[Wail al-Shehri]], [[Waleed al-Shehri]] and [[Mohand al-Shehri]], was born in the [['Asir Province]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].  Born to the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] tribe of [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;willalOmari&quot;&gt;Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others&lt;/ref&gt; Nami served as a [[muezzin]] at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he left his family home in [[Abha]] in the summer of 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but never returned – instead travelling to the [[Al Farouq training camp]] in [[Afghanistan]] where he met  and befriended [[Waleed al-Shehri|Waleed]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]], two brothers from [[Khamis Mushayt]] in the same province, and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. The four reportedly pledged themselves to [[Jihad]] in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail – who had dubbed himself ''Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi'' after one of [[Muhammad]]'s companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml |title=Before oath to jihad, drifting and boredom |first=Charles M. |last=Sennott |date=3 March 2002 |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208034606/http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml |archive-date=8 December 2002 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed &quot;Abu Hashim&quot;, Nami was considered &quot;gentle in manner&quot; by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a [[mare]] along with [[Muhammad]], and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.&lt;ref name=&quot;willalOmari&quot;/&gt;

During his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]]'s details that Nami had recently had [[laser eye surgery]], an uncited fact that does not reappear.

By October he had taken a prospective hijacker [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]] from [[Afghanistan]] to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 tourist/business visas on October 28 – but Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as ''student'' but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as [[Los Angeles]] – in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his [[passport]] (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to [[Afghanistan]]) as &quot;lost&quot;, and procured a new one from [[Jeddah]] (C505363).  He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa.&lt;ref name=&quot;visa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |work=[[9/11 Commission]] |year=2004 |format=PDF |access-date=7 December 2018 |first=Thomas R. |last=Eldridge |first2=Susan |last2=Ginsburg |first3=Walter T. |last3=Hempel II |first4=Janice L. |last4=Kephart |first5=Kelly |last5=Moore |editor-first=Joanne M. |editor-last=Accolla |editor-first2=Alice |editor-last2=Falk |pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application.  Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.

In mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that Nami, [[Wail al-Shehri|Wail]] and [[Waleed al-Shehri]], all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to [[Beirut]] and then onward to [[Iran]] where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get &quot;clean&quot; passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch7-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch7.htm|title=9/11 Commission Report|publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|pages=231–240|chapter=Chapter 7.3–The Attack Looms, Assembling the Teams|accessdate=2008-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023214223/http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch7.htm|archive-date=2013-10-23|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the [[United Arab Emirates]], Nami purchased [[traveler's cheque]]s presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]].

===2001===
In March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an [[al-Qaeda]] farewell video showing 13 of the &quot;muscle hijackers&quot; before they left their training centre in [[Kandahar]]; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.

On April 23, Nami was recorded obtaining a new US visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/911/911Report-542.html |title=Page 542 |work=Faqs.org |access-date=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, Nami arrived in the United States from [[Dubai]] with fellow-hijackers [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]]. By early June, Nami was living in apartment 1504 at the Delray Racquet Club condominiums with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] in [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. He [[telephone]]d his family in 'Asir shortly after arriving in the country.

In June, he phoned his family for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A19549-2001Sep24&amp;notFound=true |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Some Light Shed On Saudi Suspects |first=Caryle |last=Murphy |author-link=Caryle Murphy |first2=David B. |last2=Ottaway |date=September 25, 2001 |access-date=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024231/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A19549-2001Sep24&amp;notFound=true |archive-date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on June 29 received either a Florida State Identification Card or Drivers License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf |title=Chapter 2- Chronology |format=PDF |access-date=May 3, 2010 |pages=6–44 |work=[[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He may have been one of three hijackers that listed the Naval Air Station in [[Pensacola, Florida]] as their permanent address on drivers' licenses, though other sources claim he listed the Delray condominium.

On August 28, Nami and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] reportedly bothered a [[Delray Beach]] resident, Maria Siscar Simpson, to let them through her apartment to retrieve a towel that had fallen off their balcony onto hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/01/911/Florida__terror_s_lau.shtml |title=911: Florida: terror's launching pad |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=1 September 2002 |access-date=May 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020905151317/http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/01/911/Florida__terror_s_lau.shtml |archive-date=September 5, 2002 |first=Thomas C. |last=Tobin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, Nami and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] purchased tickets for a September 7 flight to [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] at Mile High Travel on Commercial Boulevard—paying cash for their tickets. [[Ziad Jarrah]] and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] also purchased tickets for the same flight from Passage Tours.

On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from [[Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Newark International Airport]] aboard [[Spirit Airlines]].

==Attacks==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 93}}

On September 11, 2001, Nami arrived in Newark to board [[United Airlines Flight 93]] along with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Ziad Jarrah]]. Some reports suggest Haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras at the time has compounded the problem. Nami boarded the plane between 7:39&amp;nbsp;am and 7:48&amp;nbsp;am; seated in First Class 3C, next to Saeed al-Ghamdi.

Due to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. The hijackers crashed the plane into the [[Pennsylvania]]n countryside rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.

==Aftermath==
After the attacks, an employee of [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] named Ahmed al-Nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.&lt;ref&gt;https://forum.dbpoweramp.com/showthread.php?3455-Many-Of-The-Supposed-9-11-Hijackers-Are-Still-Alive&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
He has been portrayed by British actor [[Jamie Harding]] in the 2006 film ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' and Asim Wali in the film ''[[Flight 93 (2006 film)|Flight 93]]''.
