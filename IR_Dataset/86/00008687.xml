In 1701, [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] founded [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]], the future city of Detroit. During the 19th century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the [[Great Lakes region]]. The city became the 4th-largest in the nation in 1920, after only [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]], with the influence of the booming auto industry.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Jenny (June 15, 1999).[http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 How Prohibition made Detroit a bootlegger's dream town] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120709135445/http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 |date=July 9, 2012 }}.

{{Main|History of Detroit|Timeline of Detroit}}

===Early settlement===
[[Paleo-Indian]] people inhabited areas near Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago including the culture referred to as the [[Mound-builders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lemke&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemke|first1=Ashley|title=Great Lakes Rangifer and Paleoindians: Archaeological and Paleontological Caribou Remains from Michigan|journal=PaleoAmerica|date=2015|volume=1|issue=3|page=277|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the region was inhabited by [[Huron people|Huron]], [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;teasdale&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teasdale|first1=Guillaume|title=Old Friends and New Foes: French Settlers and Indians in the Detroit River Border Region|journal=Michigan Historical Review|date=2012|volume=38|issue=2|pages=35–62|access-date=|doi=10.5342/michhistrevi.38.2.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Europeans did not penetrate into the region and reach the straits of Detroit until French missionaries and traders worked their way around the [[League of the Iroquois]], with whom they were at war, and other Iroquoian tribes in the 1630s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHeritageBk&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Huron and [[Neutral people]]s held the north side of [[Lake Erie]] until the 1650s, when the Iroquois pushed both and the [[Erie people]] away from the lake and its [[beaver]]-rich feeder streams in the [[Beaver Wars]] of 1649–1655.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHeritageBk&quot;/&gt; By the 1670s, the war-weakened Iroquois laid claim to as far south as the [[Ohio River]] valley in northern [[Kentucky]] as hunting grounds,&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHeritageBk&quot;/&gt; and had absorbed many other Iroquoian peoples after defeating them in war.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHeritageBk&quot;/&gt; For the next hundred years, virtually no British, colonist, or French action was contemplated without consultation with, or consideration of the Iroquois' likely response.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHeritageBk&quot;/&gt; When the [[French and Indian War]] evicted the [[Kingdom of France]] from Canada, it removed one barrier to British colonists migrating west.&lt;ref&gt;http://totallyhistory.com/french-and-indian-war&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
British negotiations with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to a Crown policy limiting settlements below the [[Great Lakes]] and west of the [[Alleghenies]]. Many colonial American would-be migrants resented this restraint and became supporters of the [[American Revolution]]. The 1778 raids and resultant 1779 decisive [[Sullivan Expedition]] reopened the [[Ohio Country]] to westward emigration, which began almost immediately. By 1800 white settlers were pouring westwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov/historicalmarkers/inventoryfour.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later settlement===
[[File:Sainte Anne de Detroit Catholic Church (Detroit, MI) - exterior.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|upright|[[Ste. Anne de Detroit Catholic Church|Ste.

The city was named by [[New France|French colonists]], referring to the [[Detroit River]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|le détroit du lac Érié}}, meaning ''the [[strait]] of Lake Erie''), linking [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]; in the historical context, the strait included the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]] and the Detroit River.&lt;ref name=&quot;RivièreduDétroit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/french/exhibits/franco_ontarian/big/big_36_map_detroit_river.htm |title=La rivière du Détroit depuis le lac Érié, 1764 |access-date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703220808/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/french/exhibits/franco_ontarian/big/big_36_map_detroit_river.htm |archivedate=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of U.S. place names of French origin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 1701, the French explorer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], along with more than a hundred other settlers, began constructing a small fort on the north bank of the Detroit River. Cadillac would later name the settlement [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVP055AfqNEC&amp;pg=PA15|title=This is Detroit, 1701–2001|last=Woodford|first=Arthur M.|date=2001|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0814329144|pages=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain]], Minister of Marine under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Riley, John L.|title=The Once and Future Great Lakes Country: An Ecological History|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=2013|isbn=978-0-7735-4177-1}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A church was soon founded here, and the parish was known as Sainte Anne de Détroit. France offered free land to colonists to attract families to Detroit; when it reached a population of 800 in 1765, this was the largest European settlement between [[Montreal]] and [[New Orleans]], both also French settlements, in the former colonies of New France and La Louisiane, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm French Ontario in the 17th and 18th centuries – Detroit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040824111504/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm |date=August 24, 2004 }}. ''Archives of Ontario'' July 14, 2008. Retrieved July 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1773, after the addition of Anglo-American settlers, the population of Detroit was 1,400. By 1778, its population reached 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in what was known as the [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]] since the British takeover of French colonies following their victory in the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''Many Roads to Red River'' (2001), p69&lt;/ref&gt;

The region's economy was based on the lucrative [[fur trade]], in which numerous Native American people had important roles as trappers and traders. Today the [[flag of Detroit]] reflects its French colonial heritage. Descendants of the earliest French and [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] settlers formed a cohesive community, who gradually were superseded as the dominant population after more [[Anglo-American]] settlers arrived in the early 19th century with American westward migration. Living along the shores of Lakes St. Clair, and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the ethnic French Canadians of Detroit, also known as [[Muskrat French]] in reference to the fur trade, remain a subculture in the region in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaForest|first1=James|title='Muskrat French': French-Canadian River Culture in the Windsor/Detroit Region|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/muskrat-french-french-canadian-river-culture-in-the-windsordetroit-region/|website=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|publisher=James LaForest|access-date=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beneteau|first1=Marcel|title=Detroit River: A Special Place in French North American History|url=http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/en/article-453/Detroit_River:_A_Special_Place_in_French_North_American_History.html|website=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|publisher=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|access-date=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–63), the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France, British troops gained control of the settlement in 1760, and shortened its name to ''Detroit''. Several regional Native American tribes, such as the Potowatomi, Ojibwe and Huron, launched [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] (1763), and conducted a [[siege of Fort Detroit]], but failed to capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America east of the Mississippi to Britain following the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan (first the territory, then the state). The United States commander at Detroit surrendered without a fight to British troops during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Siege of Detroit]], believing his forces were vastly outnumbered. The [[Battle of Frenchtown]] (January 18–23, 1813) was part of a U.S. effort to retake the city, and U.S. troops suffered their highest fatalities of any battle in the war. This battle is commemorated at [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]] south of Detroit in Monroe County. Detroit was recaptured by the United States later that year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/rira/learn/historyculture/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous men from Detroit volunteered to fight for the Union during the [[American Civil War]], including the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment. It was part of the legendary [[Iron Brigade]], which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863. When the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment arrived to fortify Washington, D.C., President [[Abraham Lincoln]] is quoted as saying &quot;Thank God for Michigan!&quot; [[George Armstrong Custer]] led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the Civil War and called them the &quot;Wolverines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). &quot;Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg,&quot; ''[[Michigan History magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, wealthy industry and shipping magnates commissioned design and construction of several [[Gilded Age]] mansions east and west of the current downtown, along the major avenues of the Woodward plan. Most notable among them was the [[David Whitney House]] at 4421 [[Woodward Avenue]], and the grand avenue became a favored address for mansions. During this period some referred to Detroit as the &quot;Paris of the West&quot; for its architecture, grand avenues in the Paris style, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. Strategically located along the [[Great Lakes]] waterway, Detroit emerged as a major port and transportation hub.

In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first automobile in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue. During this growth period, Detroit expanded its borders by annexing all or part of several surrounding villages and townships.

===20th century===

In 1903, Henry Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing—and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge Brothers]], [[Packard]], and [[Walter Chrysler]]—established Detroit's status in the early 20th century as the world's automotive capital.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; The growth of the auto industry was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the Midwest and nation, with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations, as well as factories for parts and tires.

With the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories, [[labor unions]] such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[United Auto Workers]] fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages. They initiated [[Strike action|strikes]] and other tactics in support of improvements such as [[8-hour working day|the 8-hour day/40-hour work week]], increased [[wage]]s, greater benefits and improved [[Occupational safety and health|working conditions]].

Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following the rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. 

Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] beginning in 1915. &quot;By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,&quot; whose members primarily opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, but also practiced discrimination against black Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;43riots&quot;&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ &quot;Detroit Race Riots 1943&quot;].

One-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic organizer with the federal [[Works Progress Administration]]. Some 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.

Jobs expanded so rapidly due to the defense buildup in World War II that 400,000 people migrated to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many of them from the South. Whites, including ethnic Europeans, feared black competition for jobs and scarce housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work, but when in June 1943 Packard promoted three black people to work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 white workers walked off the job.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP3DbiRcbPAC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=I%E2%80%99d+rather+see+Hitler+and+Hirohito+win+than+work+next+to+a+nigger#v=onepage&amp;q=I%E2%80%99d%20rather%20see%20Hitler%20and%20Hirohito%20win%20than%20work%20next%20to%20a%20nigger Philip A.

===Postwar era===
Industrial mergers in the 1950s, especially in the automobile sector, increased [[oligopoly]] in the American auto industry. Detroit manufacturers such as [[Packard Motor Car Company|Packard]] and [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] merged into other companies and eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, in the [[1950 United States Census|1950 Census]], the city was the 5th-largest in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

In this postwar era, the auto industry continued to create opportunities for many African Americans from the South, who continued with their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to Detroit and other northern and western cities to escape the strict [[Jim Crow]] laws and racial discrimination policies of the South. As before the war, competition had been fierce for employment, housing, and land. Racial discrimination took place in employment, keeping the work force and better jobs predominantly white. These unequal opportunities in employment resulted in unequal housing opportunities for the majority of the black community. Despite changes in demographics, for instance, Detroit's police force, fire department, and other city jobs were held by predominately white residents.

The surge in Detroit's black population with the Great Migration augmented the strain on housing scarcity. Black people were often turned away from bank loans to obtain housing and interest rates, and rents were unfairly inflated to prevent their moving into white neighborhoods. Such discrimination also took place due to [[redlining]] by banks and federal housing policy, which limited the ability of blacks to improve their housing, and encouraged white people to guard the racial divide that defined their neighborhoods. This marginalized the agency of black Detroiters—another important aspect in the history of postwar Detroit.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Origins of the Urban Crisis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |year=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1950|As in other major American cities]] in the postwar era, construction of a federally subsidized, extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit, and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. However, this construction had negative implications for many urban residents. Highways were constructed through neighborhoods of poor and minority residents who had less political power to oppose them. (The neighborhoods were mostly low income or considered blighted, made up of older housing, where investment had been lacking due to racial redlining, so the highways were presented as a kind of urban renewal.) They displaced residents with little consideration of the effects of breaking up functioning neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Origins of the Urban Crisis&quot;/&gt; 

In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used [[streetcar|electric streetcar line]], which traveled along the length of Woodward Avenue, was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on [[Woodward Avenue]] every 60 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Gavrilovich 2000 p.232&quot;&gt;Peter Gavrilovich &amp; Bill McGraw (2000) ''The Detroit Almanac: 300 Years of Life in the Motor City.'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9040 News+Views: Back track], ''Metro Times,'' Retrieved on July 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these changes in the area's transportation system favored low-density, auto-oriented development rather than high-density urban development. Industry also moved to the suburbs, seeking large plots of land for single story factories. By the 21st century, the metro Detroit area had developed as one of the most [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] job markets in the United States; combined with poor public transport, this resulted in many new jobs being beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20130418/BUSINESS06/304180118/jobs-sprawl-Detroit-Brookings-Institution &quot;Metro Detroit job sprawl worst in U.S.; many jobs beyond reach of poor&quot;], ''Detroit Free Press''.

In June 1963, Rev.

Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the [[1967 Detroit riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in July 1967. Governor [[George W.

The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas.

On August 18, 1970, the [[NAACP]] filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor [[William Milliken]], charging ''de facto'' public school segregation.

Following the failure to reach a regional agreement over the larger system, the city moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the [[Detroit People Mover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Detroit ended up with the worst public transit|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/how-detroit-ended-up-with-the-worst-public-transit/Content?oid=2143889|accessdate=April 21, 2015|newspaper=Metro Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] also affected Detroit and the U.S. auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign makers as the price of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles of the auto industry, as their sales and market share declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city used [[eminent domain]] to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poletown Becomes Just a Memory: GM Plant Opens, Replacing Old Detroit Neighborhood|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-18/business/fi-6228_1_gm-plant|newspaper=LA Times | first=James|last=Risen|date=September 18, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mayor, Young sought to revive the city by seeking to increase investment in the city's declining downtown. The [[Renaissance Center]], a mixed-use office and retail complex, opened in 1977. This group of skyscrapers was an attempt to keep businesses in downtown.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;&lt;ref name=partnership/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; Young also gave city support to other large developments to attract middle and upper-class residents back to the city. Despite the Renaissance Center and other projects, the downtown area continued to lose businesses to the [[Automobile dependency|automobile-dependent]] suburbs. Major stores and hotels closed, and many large office buildings went vacant. Young was criticized for being too focused on downtown development and not doing enough to lower the city's high crime rate and improve city services to residents.

Previously a major population center and site of worldwide automobile manufacturing, Detroit has suffered a long economic decline produced by numerous factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kamelia |last=Angelova |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/the-incredible-decline-of-detroit-photos-2012-10?op=1 |title =Bleak Photos Capture The Fall Of Detroit |website =Business Insider |date =October 2, 2012 |access-date=February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Walter |last=Williams |url =http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-perspective/121812-637538-detroit-collapse-was-due-to-race-based-politics.htm?p=full |title =Detroit's Tragic Decline Is Largely Due To Its Own Race-Based Policies |publisher =Investor's Business Daily |date =December 18, 2012 |access-date=February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pete |last=Saunders |url =http://www.urbanophile.com/2012/02/21/the-reasons-behind-detroits-decline-by-pete-saunders/ |title =The Reasons Behind Detroit's Decline |work=Urbanophile |date =February 21, 2012 |access-date=February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|many industrial American cities]], Detroit peak population was in 1950, before postwar suburbanization took effect. The peak population was 1.8 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Census&quot;/&gt; 

Following suburbanization, industrial restructuring, and loss of jobs (as described above), by the 2010 census, the city had less than 40 percent of that number, with just over 700,000 residents. The city has declined in population in each census since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Census&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/05/19/detroit-population-rank-lowest-since/84574198/ |title=Detroit population rank is lowest since 1850 |last=MacDonald |first=Christine |work=The Detroit News |date=May 19, 2016 |access-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High unemployment was compounded by [[middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, and some residents leaving the state to find work. The result for the city was a higher proportion of poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed property values, abandoned buildings, abandoned neighborhoods, high crime rates, and a pronounced demographic imbalance.&lt;!-- In what sense? --&gt;

On August 16, 1987, [[Northwest Airlines Flight 255]] crashed near Detroit, killing all but one of the 155 people on board, as well as two people on the ground.

In 1993 Young retired as Detroit's longest-serving mayor, deciding not to seek a sixth term. That year the city elected [[Dennis Archer]], a former Michigan Supreme Court justice. Archer prioritized downtown development and easing tensions with Detroit's suburban neighbors. A referendum to allow casino gambling in the city passed in 1996; several temporary casino facilities opened in 1999, and permanent downtown casinos with hotels opened in 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Riverfront History|url=http://www.degc.org/businesses/east-riverfront-history-1|publisher=Detroit Economic Growth Corporation|access-date=April 21, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629145310/http://www.degc.org/businesses/east-riverfront-history-1|archivedate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detroit's protracted decline has resulted in severe [[urban decay]], with thousands of empty buildings around the city, referred to as [[greyfield land|greyfield]]. Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely populated the city has difficulty providing [[municipal services]]. The city has demolished abandoned homes and buildings, planting grass and trees; and considered removing street lighting from large portions of the city, in order to encourage the small population in certain areas to move to more populated areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;detroitparcelsurvey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalpost&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;couriermail&quot; /&gt; Roughly half of the owners of Detroit's 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills, resulting in about $246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected, nearly half of which was due to Detroit.

[[Belle Isle Park]] is a {{convert|982|acre|sqmi ha|adj=on}} island park in the [[Detroit River]], between Detroit and [[Windsor, Ontario]]. It is connected to the mainland by the [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|MacArthur Bridge]] in Detroit. Belle Isle Park contains such attractions as the [[James Scott Memorial Fountain]], the [[Belle Isle Conservatory]], the [[Detroit Yacht Club]] on an adjacent island, a half-mile (800 m) beach, a golf course, a nature center, monuments, and gardens. The city skyline may be viewed from the island.

Three road systems cross the city: the original [[France|French]] template, with avenues radiating from the waterfront, and true [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|north–south roads]] based on the [[Northwest Ordinance]] township system. The city is north of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Detroit is the only major city along the Canada–U.S. border in which one travels south in order to cross into Canada.

Detroit has four border crossings: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]] provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]] providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the [[Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry]], near the Windsor Salt Mine and [[Zug Island]]. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city was developed over a {{convert|1500|acre|ha|adj=on}} salt mine that is {{convert|1100|ft|m|-1}} below the surface. The [[Detroit salt mine]] run by the Detroit Salt Company has over {{convert|100|mi|km|}} of roads within.&lt;ref&gt;Zacharias, Patricia (January 23, 2000).

[[File:One Detroit Center (Detroit, MI, USA).jpg|thumb|left|The [[One Detroit Center]] and the Michigan Labor Legacy Monument.]]

Seen in panorama, Detroit's waterfront shows a variety of architectural styles. The [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] Neo-Gothic spires of the [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) were designed to refer to  the city's [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers. Together with the [[Renaissance Center]], these buildings form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the Art Deco style include the [[Guardian Building]] and [[Penobscot Building]] downtown, as well as the [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] in the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] area near [[Wayne State University]]. Among the city's prominent structures are United States' largest [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Detroit Opera House]], and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], all built in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=AIADetroit&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Hill, Eric J.  |author2=John Gallagher | title= AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture| year=2002 | publisher=Wayne State University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DetArch&gt;{{Cite book | author=Sharoff, Robert | title=American City: Detroit Architecture| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6| author-link=Robert Sharoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, residential high-rises are found in upper-class neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront, extending toward [[Grosse Pointe]], and the [[Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District|Palmer Park]] neighborhood just west of Woodward. The University Commons-Palmer Park district in northwest Detroit, near the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] and [[Marygrove College]], anchors historic neighborhoods including [[Palmer Woods]], [[Sherwood Forest, Detroit|Sherwood Forest]], and the [[University District, Detroit|University District]].

Forty-two significant structures or sites are listed on the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Detroit, Michigan|National Register of Historic Places]]. Neighborhoods constructed prior to World War II feature the architecture of the times, with wood-frame and brick houses in the working-class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in middle-class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in upper-class neighborhoods such as [[Brush Park]], [[Woodbridge, Detroit|Woodbridge]], [[Indian Village, Detroit|Indian Village]], [[Palmer Woods]], [[Boston-Edison Historic District|Boston-Edison]], and others.

Some of the oldest neighborhoods are along the major Woodward and [[East Jefferson Avenue Residential TR|East Jefferson]] corridors, which formed spines of the city. Some newer residential construction may also be found along the Woodward corridor, and in the far west and northeast. The oldest extant neighborhoods include [[West Canfield Historic District|West Canfield]] and [[Brush Park]]. There have been multi-million dollar restorations of existing homes and construction of new homes and condominiums here.&lt;ref name=partnership&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html |title=DEVELOPMENT and growth |access-date=May 16, 2009 |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613121052/http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html |archivedate=June 13, 2008 |work=City of Detroit Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Jaime (September 12, 2006).[http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/bpark61.aspx Falling for Brush Park].''Model D Media''.

The [[Detroit International Riverfront]] includes a partially completed three-and-one-half mile riverfront promenade with a combination of parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas. It extends from [[Hart Plaza]] to the MacArthur Bridge, which connects to [[Belle Isle Park]], the largest island park in a U.S. city. The riverfront includes [[Tri-Centennial State Park]] and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. The second phase is a {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|sp=us|adj=on|abbr=off}} extension from Hart Plaza to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} of parkway from bridge to bridge. Civic planners envision the pedestrian parks will stimulate residential redevelopment of riverfront properties condemned under [[eminent domain]].

In the [[2010 United States Census]], the city had 713,777 residents, ranking it the [[List of United States cities by population|18th most populous city]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusCity&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Census&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Katherine Q.|title=Detroit Population Down 25 Percent, Census Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23detroit.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the large [[shrinking cities]] in the United States, Detroit has had the most dramatic decline in population of the past 60 years (down 1,135,791) and the second largest percentage decline (down 61.4%).

Detroit's 713,777 residents represent 269,445 households, and 162,924 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,144.3 people per square mile (1,895/km²). There were 349,170 housing units at an average density of 2,516.5 units per square mile (971.6/km²). Housing density has declined. The city has demolished thousands of Detroit's abandoned houses, planting some areas and in others allowing the growth of [[urban prairie]].

Of the 269,445 households, 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 21.5% were married couples living together, 31.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 39.5% were non-families, 34.0% were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. Average household size was 2.59, and average family size was 3.36.

There is a wide distribution of age in the city, with 31.1% under the age of 18, 9.7% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.5 males.

According to a 2014 study, 67% of the population of the city identified themselves as [[Christians]], with 49% professing attendance at [[Protestant]] churches, and 16% professing [[Roman Catholic]] beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/29/major-u-s-metropolitan-areas-differ-in-their-religious-profiles/ Major U.S. metropolitan areas differ in their religious profiles], Pew Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 24% claim [[Irreligion|no religious affiliation]].

In the 2010 [[American Community Survey]], median household income in the city was $25,787, and the median income for a family was $31,011. The per capita income for the city was $14,118. 32.3% of families had income at or below the federally defined poverty level. Out of the total population, 53.6% of those under the age of 18 and 19.8% of those 65 and older had income at or below the federally defined poverty line.

Much of Detroit's history is racially-charged and rooted in the effects of structural and individualized racism. Beginning with the rise of the automobile industry, the city's population increased more than sixfold during the first half of the 20th century as an influx of European, Middle Eastern ([[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese]], [[Assyrian Americans|Assyrian/Chaldean]]), and Southern migrants brought their families to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Baulch, Vivian M.

Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the original white families in Detroit saw this increase in diversity as a threat to their way of life and made it their mission to isolate black people from their neighborhoods, workplaces, and public institutions. Perhaps one of the most overt examples of neighborhood discrimination occurred in 1925 when African American physician, [[Ossian Sweet]] found his home surrounded by an angry mob of his hostile white neighbors violently protesting his new move into a traditionally white neighborhood. [[Ossian Sweet|Sweet]] and ten of his family members and friends were put on trial for murder as one of the mob members throwing rocks at the newly purchased house was shot and killed by someone firing out of a second floor window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-691-16255-3|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many middle-class families experienced the same kind of hostility as they sought the security of homeownership and the potential for upward mobility.

Detroit has a relatively large Mexican-American population. In the early 20th century, thousands of Mexicans came to Detroit to work in agricultural, automotive, and steel jobs. During the [[Mexican Repatriation]] of the 1930s many Mexicans in Detroit were willingly repatriated or forced to repatriate. By the 1940s much of the Mexican community began to settle what is now [[Mexicantown, Detroit|Mexicantown]].

By 1940, 80% of Detroit deeds contained [[restrictive covenants]] prohibiting African Americans from buying houses they could afford. These discriminatory tactics were successful as a majority of black people in Detroit resorted to living in all black neighborhoods such as [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] and Paradise Valley. At this time, white people still made up about 90.4% of the city's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;census1&quot; /&gt; From the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|1940s to the 1970s a second wave of black people moved to Detroit]] in search of employment and with the desire to escape the [[Jim Crow laws]] enforcing segregation in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin92&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/|title=Detroit and the Great Migration 1916–1929|last=Martin|first=Elizabeth Anne|publisher=University of Michigan|year=1992|chapter=City of Opportunity|quote=The thousands of African-Americans who flocked to Detroit were part of the &quot;Great Migration&quot; of the twentieth century.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212184120/http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/|archivedate=December 12, 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they soon found themselves once again excluded from many opportunities in Detroit—through [[Racially motivated crime|violence]] and policy perpetuating [[economic discrimination]] (e.g., [[redlining]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DetroitDivided&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olcZfAD7cPEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage|title=Detroit divided|author1=Reynolds Farley|author2=Sheldon Danziger|author3=Harry J.

In 1948, the landmark Supreme Court case of [[Shelley v. Kraemer|Shelley v Kraemer]] outlawed restrictive covenants and while racism in housing did not disappear, it allowed affluent black families to begin moving to traditionally white neighborhoods. Proving their persistent prejudice and unwillingness to integrate, many white families with the financial ability moved to the suburbs of Detroit taking their jobs and tax dollars with them. By 1950, much of the city's white population had moved to the suburbs as macrostructural processes such as &quot;[[white flight]]&quot; and &quot;[[suburbanization]]&quot; led to a complete population shift.

The [[Detroit Riot of 1967|Detroit Rebellion of 1967]] is considered to be one of the greatest racial turning points in the history of the city.

The city of Detroit has a rich musical heritage and has contributed to a number of different genres over the decades leading into the new millennium.&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt; Important music events in the city include: the [[Detroit International Jazz Festival]], the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], the Motor City Music Conference (MC2), the Urban Organic Music Conference, the Concert of Colors, and the hip-hop Summer Jamz festival.&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Detroit blues]] artist [[John Lee Hooker]] became a long-term resident in the city's southwest Delray neighborhood. Hooker, among other important [[blues]] musicians migrated from his home in [[Mississippi]] bringing the [[Delta blues]] to northern cities like Detroit. Hooker recorded for [[Fortune Records]], the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; Prominent emerging [[Jazz]] musicians of the 1960s included: trumpet player [[Donald Byrd]] who attended Cass Tech and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career and Saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]] who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums.

Other, prominent Motor City R&amp;B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s was [[Nolan Strong]], [[Andre Williams]] and [[Nathaniel Mayer]] – who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label, a family-operated label on Third Avenue in Detroit, was owned by the husband and wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;{{Cite book |first= David A. |last= Carson |title= Noise, and Revolution: The Birth of Detroit Rock 'n' Roll |publisher= University of Michigan Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-472-11503-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Motown Sound]] played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit.

In college sports, Detroit's central location within the Mid-American Conference has made it a frequent site for the league's championship events. While the MAC Basketball Tournament moved permanently to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] starting in 2000, the MAC Football Championship Game has been played at Ford Field in Detroit since 2004, and annually attracts 25,000 to 30,000 fans.
