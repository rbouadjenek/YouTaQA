In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Αμαζόνες ''Amazónes'', singular Αμαζών ''Amazōn'') were a tribe of warrior women believed to live in [[Asia Minor]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], in his ''[[Argonautica]]'', mentions that the Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a [[nymph]] of the Akmonian Wood), that they were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name=&quot;theoi.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html#Amazones Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' (''Book 2'', ln. 989)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2&quot;&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA, BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysias]], [[Isocrates]], [[Philostratus the Elder]] also say that their father was Ares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg002.perseus-grc1:4 Lysias, ''Funeral Oration'', §4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg011.perseus-grc1:68 Isocrates, ''Panegyricus'', §68]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg021.perseus-grc1:193 Isocrates, ''Panathenaicus'', §193]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0638.tlg004.perseus-grc1:750 Philostratus, ''Heroica'', §750]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Terme River|Thermodon River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus' History (''Book 4'': ''Melpomene'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diodorus]], giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene (who in turn drew on Thymoetas), the Amazons inhabited [[Ancient Libya]] long before they settled along the Thermodon.&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope.uchicago.edu&quot;&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html Diodorus Siculus' ''Bibliotheca Historica'' (''Book III'', Ch. 52)]&lt;/ref&gt; Migrating from Libya, these Amazons passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, Diodorus maintains, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]], and from which they moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND&quot;&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. The Amazons fought on the side of Troy against the Greeks during the Trojan War.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Diodorus mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his ''On Unbelievable Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), wrote that the Amazons were probably men who were mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and in addition, because they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019 a grave with Amazons in golden royal crowns was found near Russia's [[Voronezh]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-amazon-warrior-women-russia-archaeology-scythian-greece-1.8327358&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' &quot;warriors&quot;, a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|&quot;ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι&quot;}} (&quot;''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian&quot;), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' &quot;make&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' &quot;manless, without husbands&quot; ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed &quot;unlikely&quot; by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' &quot;virility-killing&quot; as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed the Amazons on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] (today's [[Terme river]]) and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] (probably close to the modern city of [[Terme]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene&quot;&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived in [[Scythia]] because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed on Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus: ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 4.110.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but that they were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]). But he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND&quot;/&gt; [[Homer]] had placed the Amazons much closer to the Greek world of his times, saying that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt;

[[Diodorus Siculus]], giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;penelope.uchicago.edu&quot;/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]]]]

[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaigns of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons took place on the [[Euxine Sea]] (the modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago2&quot;&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm. Mar. Mag., ed. Hoffmann, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on the island of [[Lemnos]], there was another Myrina.&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt; The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' (third century BC), mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001&quot;&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994–1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other names===
Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') (&quot;killers/slayers of men&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene&quot;/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') (&quot;destroyers of men, murderesses&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND&quot;/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') (&quot;equivalent to men&quot;) and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) (&quot;those who loathe all men&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.tufts.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]] and in the [[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|Suppliant Maidens]] he called them &quot;...τὰς ἀνάνδρους κρεοβόρους τ᾽ Ἀμαζόνας&quot; (&quot;the unwed, flesh-devouring Amazons&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0015%3Acard%3D274 Aeschylus, Suppliant Maidens, §287]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]] play, [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] calls [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], &quot;the son of the horse-loving Amazon&quot; ({{lang|grc|...τῆς φιλίππου παῖς Ἀμαζόνος βοᾷ Ἱππόλυτος...}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0105%3Acard%3D581 Euripides, Hippolytus, §581-584]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonnus]] at [[Dionysiaca]] call the Amazons of Dionysus, ''Androphonus'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροφόνους}}) (&quot;men slaying&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonnus, Dionysiaca, § 20.197&quot;&gt;[https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/Διονυσιακά/36 Nonnus, Dionysiaca, § 20.197]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning &quot;man&quot;, and ''pata'' meaning &quot;to slay&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene&quot;/&gt;

===Historical background===
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, &quot;Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the [[Black Sea]] in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, &quot;Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence&quot;, in: ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 2nd Series, 31.1 (April 1984), pp. 37–47, esp. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

===The Amazons and Troy===

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends and myths. According to the ''Iliad'', Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] &quot;of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth&quot;, who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost; only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], i. 699.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ii. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11, § 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Her.'' xix. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lycian King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against the Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', Book ii. 45–46; Book iii. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; later interpretation made an Amazon of her. According to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called &quot;Amazon Mounds&quot; ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dealings with the Scythians===
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|''Amazons and Scythians'', by [[Otto van Veen]], [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna]]

[[Herodotus]] mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the [[Scythians]]. There they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp.

This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages, but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene&quot;/&gt;

===The Amazons in their homeland===
In some versions of the myth, the Amazons lived always isolated from men, communicating with them only to reproduce, and raising only female offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M. (2010). {{Google books|tOgWfjNIxoMC|Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology.|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; No men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; [[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt;

Strabo also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt; In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and using the bow.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt;

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], in his ''[[Argonautica]]'', mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name=&quot;theoi.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2&quot;/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001&quot;/&gt; Also, he mentions that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple to Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380–390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

===Battles with Hercules and Theseus, dealings with Alexander the Great===
One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by the king of Tyrins, [[Eurystheus]], was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], xi. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; First Hippolyte had been favorable to gift the girdle to Heracles, but Hera, disguised as Hippolyte, started the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago2&quot;/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]]. In ''[[The Eumenides]]'', [[Athena]] says to the citizens of [[Attica]] that Amazons used the [[Areopagus]] as a camp during their campaign against Athens and Theseus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0085.tlg007.perseus-grc1:681 Aeschylus, Eumenides, § 683-695]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]], in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' (''The Life of Theseus''), mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''The Amazon Queen, [[Thalestris]], in the camp of [[Alexander the Great]]'', by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

Amazons are also heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of the Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25–26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said &quot;And where was I, then?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battles with and against Dionysus===
According to Plutarch, the god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian author [[Eusebius]] writes that during the reign of [[Oxyntes]], one of the mythical kings of Athens, the Amazons burned down the temple at [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/armenian/euseb10.htm Eusebius, Chronography, §66]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyaenus]] writes that after Dionysus had subdued the Indians, he formed an alliance with them and the Amazons, and took them into his service. He later used them in his campaign against the [[Bactria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg0616/tlg001/1st1K-grc1/1.1 Polyaenus, Strategems, § 1.1.3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonnus]] in his ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' writes about the Amazons of Dionysus, but he says that they were not from Thermodon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonnus, Dionysiaca, § 20.197&quot;/&gt;

===Afterlife of a myth===
[[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons. [[Philostratus]], in ''Heroica'', writes that the [[Mysian]] women fought from horses alongside the men, just as the Amazons did, and the leader was Hiera ({{lang-grc|Ἱερὰ}}), wife of [[Telephus]].

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560 CE}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis]], holding this vast territory for 100&amp;nbsp;years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo, descended from some Amazons and taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385–387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: &quot;Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear.&quot;
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, [[Alcippe (mythology)|Alcippe]]. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370–377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and [[Thoe]]. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latin Anthology&quot; /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176–183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as &quot;the most prominent&quot; of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:
* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', &quot;Achilleus&quot; no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the city Anaea in Caria was named after the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=qB9dKo_i-QIC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Anaea+greek+city&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DOFcyjq4kQ&amp;sig=SuKJkTto1cYGZgoE5rUee2k17Zw&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0k9Ppt73fAhWSJlAKHTeECUQQ6AEwA3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Anaea&amp;f=false Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, Vol 3, William Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harpokration]] mention that [[Ammonius of Athens]] in his book &quot;On Altars and Sacrifices&quot; writes that the Amazons founded the Amazoneion sanctuary at Athens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2013.01.0002%3Aletter%3Da%3Aentry%3Damazoneion Harpokration, Lexicon of the Ten Orators, § a87]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea'']]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name=&quot;amaz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD .

The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

In the Essays in Portraiture, [[Lucian of Samosata]] ask Polystratos which, he think, is the best work of [[Phidias]] and Polystratos respond &quot;The Lemnian Athene, which bears the artist's own signature; and of course the Amazon leaning on her spear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg039.perseus-grc1:4 Lucian, Essays in Portraiture, §4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright &quot;has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'Divina Virago': Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, &quot;frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men&quot;. Moreover, said Herodotus, &quot;No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle&quot;. In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

[[Xenophon]] in [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]] writes that Democrates of Temnus captured a man with a Persian bow, a quiver and a battleaxe of the same sort that Amazons carry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0201%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D16 Xenophon, Anabasis, §4.4.16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippocrates describes them as: &quot;They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Amazons XXVIIIv.jpg|thumb|Amazons as depicted in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] at the [[Description of Greece]] writes that near [[Pyrrhichus]] there were sanctuaries of the gods [[Artemis]], called Astrateia ({{lang-grc|Ἀστρατείας}}), and [[Apollo]], called Amazonius ({{lang-grc|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) with images of the gods said to have been dedicated by the women from Thermodon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-grc1:3.25.3 Pausanias, Description of Greece, § 3.25.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' (&quot;Brazil's legends and myths&quot;), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a &quot;manly weapon&quot; should have been invented by a &quot;tribe of women&quot;, but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in &quot;[[The Knight's Tale]]&quot;.

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Riding Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa|420 BC}}, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Berlin]]

Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been &quot;inspired by real warrior women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, 'Did the Amazons really exist?' |website=Diotima |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia. David Anthony notes, &quot;About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anthonyd&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html &quot;Warrior Women of Eurasia&quot;], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. [[Jeannine Davis-Kimball]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, &quot;Herodotus and anthropology&quot; in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a &quot;hard sell&quot; for an outdated idea: &quot;The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture.&quot;--&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed &quot;Amazon Village&quot; museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;todayszaman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park – Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name=&quot;todayszaman&quot; /&gt;
