'''Alexios II Komnenos''' or '''Alexius II Comnenus''' ({{lang-gkm|Αλέξιος Β′ Κομνηνός|translit=Alexios II Komnēnos}}) (10 September 1169{{snd}}October 1183) was [[Byzantine emperor]] from 1180 to 1183. He was the son of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] and [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]], daughter of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond of Poitiers]], [[Principality of Antioch|prince of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;An alternative date of birth occasionally given is 1168 {{Harv|van Dieten|1975|p=169}}, based on [[William of Tyre]]'s statement that Alexios was 13 in 1180. For discussion, concluding that 14 September 1169 is correct, see {{Harv|Wirth|1956}}; {{Harv|Magoulias|1984|p=383}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the long-awaited male heir and was named Alexius as a fulfilment of the [[AIMA prophecy]].

==His reign and death==
On Manuel's death in 1180, Maria, who became a nun under the name Xene, took the position of regent (according to some historians). She excluded her young son from power, entrusting it instead to Alexios the ''[[protosebastos|prōtosebastos]]'' (a cousin of Alexios II), who was popularly believed to be her lover. Friends of the young Alexios II now tried to form a party against the [[Dowager]] Empress and the ''prōtosebastos''; Alexios II's half-sister Maria, wife of Caesar John ([[Renier of Montferrat]]), stirred up riots in the streets of the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexius II.|volume=1|page=577|first=John Bagnell|last=Bury|authorlink=J. B. Bury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their party was defeated on 2 May 1182, but [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos Komnenos]], a first cousin of Emperor Manuel, took advantage of the disorder to aim at the crown. He entered Constantinople, received with almost divine honours, and overthrew the government. His arrival was celebrated by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of 80,000 Latins]] in Constantinople, especially the [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, which he made no attempt to stop. He allowed Alexios II to be crowned but was responsible for the death of most of the young emperor's actual or potential defenders, including his mother, his half-sister, and the Caesar, and he refused to allow him any voice in public affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The betrothal in 1180 of Alexios II to [[Agnes of France, Byzantine Empress|Agnes of France]], daughter of [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Adèle of Champagne]] and at the time a child of nine, had not apparently been followed by their marriage. Andronikos was now formally proclaimed as co-emperor before the crowd on the terrace of the [[Arslan Hane, Istanbul|Church of Christ of the Chalkè]], and not long afterwards, on the pretext that divided rule was injurious to the Empire, he caused Alexios II to be strangled with a bow-string in October 1183.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; During the reign of Alexius II, the Byzantine Empire was invaded by King [[Béla III]], losing [[Syrmia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1181; later even [[Dalmatia]] was lost to the Venetians. [[Kilij Arslan II]] invaded the empire in 1182, defeating the Byzantines at the [[Siege of Cotyaeum]], resulting in the Empire losing [[Cotyaeum]] and [[Sozopolis, Pisidia|Sozopolis]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Portrayal in fiction==
Alexios is a character in the historical novel ''Agnes of France'' (1980) by [[Greece|Greek]] writer [[Kostas Kyriazis]]. The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel I, Alexios II, and Andronikos I through the eyes of Agnes.
