It is [[Scotland]]'s [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|third]] most populous [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], one of Scotland's 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council areas]] and the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|39th most populous built-up area]], with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen&lt;ref name=&quot;NRS Locality Estimate&quot;/&gt; and {{Scottish council populations|POP=S12000033}} for the local council area.&lt;ref name=&quot;population source&quot;&gt;{{United Kingdom district population citation|Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, which can sparkle like silver because of its high [[mica]] content.&lt;ref name=&quot;agtb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agtb.org/aberdeen-scotland.htm|title=The Granite City|accessdate=16 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509185556/http://www.agtb.org/aberdeen-scotland.htm|archivedate=9 May 2008|publisher=Aberdeen and Grampian Tourist Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the discovery of [[North Sea oil]] in the 1970s, Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni-abdn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/central/abdn/|title=About Aberdeen|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=8 February 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205025539/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/central/abdn/|archivedate=5 February 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a long, sandy coastline and a marine climate, the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters.

Aberdeen received [[Royal burgh]] status from [[David I of Scotland]] (1124–1153),&lt;ref name=&quot;civicsociety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aberdeencivicsociety.org.uk/whats-new/the-old-burghs-of-aberdeen/ |title=The old burghs of Aberdeen |publisher=Aberdeen Civic Society |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812021945/http://aberdeencivicsociety.org.uk/whats-new/the-old-burghs-of-aberdeen/ |archivedate=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; transforming the city economically. The city has two universities, the [[University of Aberdeen]], founded in 1495, and [[Robert Gordon University]], which was awarded university status in 1992, making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland. The traditional industries of fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding, and textiles have been overtaken by the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] and Aberdeen's seaport. Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial [[heliport]]s in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;BAA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/greenpolitics/planning/4930766/Flights-delayed-as-climate-protesters-invade-Aberdeen-airport.html|title=Flights delayed as climate protesters invade Aberdeen airport|date=3 March 2009|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=7 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015032/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/greenpolitics/planning/4930766/Flights-delayed-as-climate-protesters-invade-Aberdeen-airport.html|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;seaport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.archiseek.com/scotland/aberdeen/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609221650/http://uk.archiseek.com/scotland/aberdeen/index.html|archivedate=9 June 2007 |title=Architecture of Aberdeen, Scotland|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen used to host the [[Aberdeen International Youth Festival]], a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018. In 2015, [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world, as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uk.mercer.com/newsroom/2015-quality-of-living-survey.html |title=2012 Quality of Living survey |publisher=Mercer.com |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=8 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209025212/http://www.uk.mercer.com/newsroom/2015-quality-of-living-survey.html |archive-date=9 December 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[HSBC]] named Aberdeen as a leading business hub and one of eight 'super cities' spearheading the UK's economy, marking it as the only city in Scotland to receive this accolade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-20002820 |title=Aberdeen named among 'Supercities' by HSBC |work=BBC News |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022010504/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-20002820 |archive-date=22 October 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, Aberdeen was found to be the best city in the UK to start a business in a study released by card payment firm Paymentsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/north-of-scotland/1387847/granite-city-is-top-for-start-ups/|title=Why the Granite City is the best place to launch new business|author=Keith Findlay|date=8 January 2018|work=The Press and Journal|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318120501/https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/north-of-scotland/1387847/granite-city-is-top-for-start-ups/|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Aberdeen}}
[[File:The Town House, Old Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 320069.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Town House, [[Old Aberdeen]]. Once a separate burgh, Old Aberdeen was incorporated into the city in 1891]]

The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;prehistory&quot; /&gt; The city began as two separate [[burgh]]s: [[Old Aberdeen]] at the mouth of the river Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst498.html New Aberdeen], [[Gazetteer for Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[charter]] was granted by [[William the Lion]] in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. In 1319, the Great Charter of [[Robert the Bruce]] transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby [[Forest of Stocket]], whose income formed the basis for the city's [[Common Good Fund (Aberdeen)|Common Good Fund]] which still benefits Aberdonians.&lt;ref name=&quot;keith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Keith, Alexander|year=1987|title=A Thousand Years of Aberdeen |publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fraser&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=W. Hamish|last=Fraser|title=Aberdeen, 1800 to 2000: A New History |year=2000 |publisher=Tuckwell Press |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Aberdeen was under English rule, so [[Robert the Bruce]] laid siege to [[Aberdeen Castle]] before destroying it in 1308, followed executing the English garrison. The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.

[[File:The Powis gate Old Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 421948.jpg|thumb|upright|The Powis gate, Old Aberdeen, built in 1834]]
During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Battle of Aberdeen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Chris |last=Brown |title=The Battle of Aberdeen 1644|year=2002|publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later [[Battle of Aberdeen (1646)|it was stormed]] by a Royalist force under the command of the [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly|Marquis of Huntly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB|ref=harv|last=Henderson |first=Thomas Finlayson |wstitle=Gordon, George (d.1649)  |volume=22 |pages=190–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1647 an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] killed a quarter of the population. In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary|Infirmary]] at [[Woolmanhill Hospital|Woolmanhill]] in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of [[George Street, Aberdeen|George Street]], [[King Street, Aberdeen|King Street]] and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] all completed at the beginning of the 19th century.

The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the [[Post-Napoleonic depression]], an economic downturn immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; but the city's prosperity later recovered. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;fraser&quot;/&gt; The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen has a separate history and still holds its ancient charter, it is no longer officially independent. It is an integral part of the city, as is Woodside and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of the River Dee.

Over the course of the [[Second World War]] Aberdeen was attacked 32 times by the German [[Luftwaffe]]. One of the most devastating attacks was on Wednesday 21 April 1943 when 29 Luftwaffe [[Dornier Do 217|Dornier 217s]] flying from [[Stavenger]], [[Norway]] attacked the city between the hours of 22:17 and 23:04&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcjazz.f2s.com/Blitzkreig.htm &quot;The Aberdeen Mittwoch Blitz - Wednesday 21st April 1943&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105231049/http://www.mcjazz.f2s.com/Blitzkreig.htm |date=5 January 2013 }}, ''The Doric Columns'', Retrieved 13 September 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;. A total of 98 civilians and 27 servicemen were killed, along with 9,668 houses damaged, after a mixture of 127 Incendiary, High Explosive and Cluster Bombs were dropped on the city in one night. It was also the last German raid on a Scottish city during the war.

===Toponymy===
{{Main|Etymology of Aberdeen}}
Aberdeen was in [[Picts|Pictish]] territory and became Gaelic-speaking at some time in the medieval period. Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of ''Aberdon'', the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means &quot;the mouth of the Don&quot;. The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''{{lang|cel|aber}}'' means &quot;river mouth&quot;, as in modern Welsh ([[Aberystwyth]], [[Aberdare]], [[Aberbeeg]] etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;Charnock&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard Stephen |last=Charnock |title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names |year=1859 |publisher=Houlston and Wright }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] name is ''{{lang|gd|Obar Dheathain}}'' (variation: ''{{lang|gd|Obairreadhain}}''; *''{{lang|gd|obar}}'' presumably being a loan from the earlier [[Pictish language|Pictish]]; the Gaelic term is {{lang|gd|inbhir}}), and in [[Latin]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] referred to the river as ''Devana''. [[Medieval Latin|Mediaeval]] (or [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Ecclesiastical]]) Latin has it as ''{{lang|la|Aberdonia}}''.

Aberdeen is locally governed by [[Aberdeen City Council]], which comprises forty-five councillors who represent the city's [[ward (politics)|wards]] and is headed by the [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]]. The current Lord Provost is Barney Crockett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/barney-crockett-voted-in-as-aberdeens-new-lord-provost5/|title=Aberdeen Labour's Jenny Laing named council leader, Barney Crockett Lord Provost|work=Evening Express|access-date=8 June 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519040300/https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/barney-crockett-voted-in-as-aberdeens-new-lord-provost5/|archive-date=19 May 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 2003 until May 2007 the council was run by a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] coalition.

This motif dates from at least the time of [[Robert the Bruce]] and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of medieval Aberdeen: Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's [[Castlegate, Aberdeen|Castlegate]]); the city gate on Port Hill; and a church on St&amp;nbsp;Catherine's Hill (now levelled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html|title=Aberdeen City|accessdate=15 May 2007|author=Gazetter for Scotland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613171026/http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html|archive-date=13 June 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bon Accord'' is the [[motto]] of the city and is French for &quot;Good Agreement&quot;. Legend tells that its use dates from a password used by Robert the Bruce during the 14th-century [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], when he and his men laid siege to the English-held Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308.&lt;ref name=&quot;keith&quot; /&gt; It is still widely present in the city, throughout street names, business names and the city's Bon Accord shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bon Accord &amp; St Nicholas|url = http://bonaccordandstnicholas.com/|publisher = bonaccordandstnicholas.com|accessdate = 17 October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081026083320/http://www.bonaccordandstnicholas.com/|archive-date = 26 October 2008|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield in the coat of arms is [[supporters (heraldry)|supported]] by two [[leopard]]s. A local magazine is called the &quot;Leopard&quot; and, when Union Bridge was widened in the 20th century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats). The city's toast is &quot;Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again&quot;; this has been commonly misinterpreted as the translation of Bon Accord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/introducing.html|title=Aberdeen Official Guide|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=17 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218082352/http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/introducing.html|archive-date=18 February 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being sited between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian &quot;Old Red&quot; sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the [[Dalradian]] period (approximately 480–600&amp;nbsp;million years ago) with sporadic areas of [[igneous rock|igneous]] [[Diorite]] granites to be found, such as that at the [[Rubislaw quarry]] which was used to build much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |title=Details of Aberdeen City |author=Gazetter for Scotland |accessdate=10 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035411/http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee]] and the [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|Don]], which turns into high [[sand dunes]] north of the Don stretching as far as [[Fraserburgh]]; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets. A number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past, making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing.

===Climate===
Aberdeen features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''). Aberdeen has far milder winter temperatures than one might expect for its northern location, although statistically it is the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset at winter solstice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunrise and sunset for Aberdeen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/united-kingdom/aberdeen/2015|title=Sunrise and sunset for Aberdeen|publisher=Sunrise and Sunset|accessdate=27 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027200423/http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/united-kingdom/aberdeen/2015|archive-date=27 October 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunrise and sunset for Aberdeen&quot;/&gt; During this time of the year marginal [[nautical twilight]] lasts the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year will be typically hovering around {{convert|17.0|C|F}} during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer {{convert|16.0|C|F}} directly on the coast, and around {{convert|18.0|to|19.0|C|F}} in the westernmost suburbs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[MetOffice]]| url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/escotland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif| title = July temp map| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120305153715/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/escotland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif| archivedate = 5 March 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the cooling effect of the North Sea during summer. In addition, from June onward skies are more overcast than in April/May, as reflected in a lower percentage of possible sunshine (the percentage of daylight hours that are sunny). These factors render summer to be temperate and cool for the latitude, both by European standards and also compared to far inland climates on other continents, with those patterns being reversed during the mild and moderated winters.

Two weather stations collect climate data for the area, [[Aberdeen Airport|Aberdeen/Dyce Airport]], and Craibstone. Both are about {{convert|4+1/2|mi|km|0}} to the north west of the city centre, and given that they are in close proximity to each other, exhibit very similar climatic regimes. Dyce tends to have marginally warmer daytime temperatures year round owing to its slightly lower elevation, though it is more susceptible to harsh frosts. The coldest temperature to occur in recent years was {{convert|-16.8|C|F}} during December 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = TuTiempo | url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/Aberdeen_Dyce/03-12-2010/30910.htm

Christianity is the main religion practised in the city. Aberdeen's largest denominations are the [[Church of Scotland]] (through the [[Presbytery of Aberdeen]]) and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], both with numerous churches across the city, with the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] having the third-largest number. The most recent census in 2001 showed that Aberdeen has the highest proportion of non-religious residents of any city in Scotland, with nearly 43% of citizens claiming to have no religion&lt;ref name=&quot;citycensusreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1726&amp;sID=332|title=2001 Census: Key Statistics – Aberdeen City|author=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=28 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428132455/http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1726&amp;sID=332|archive-date=28 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several former churches in the city have been converted into bars and restaurants. In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen|Kirk of St&amp;nbsp;Nicholas]] was the only burgh kirk and one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], in this case into the East and West churches. At this time, the city also was home to houses of the [[Carmelites]] (Whitefriars)&lt;ref name='IA'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alison Cameron |author2=Judith A.

[[St Machar's Cathedral]] was built twenty years after [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124–1153) transferred the pre-Reformation [[Diocese]] from Mortlach in [[Banffshire]] to Old Aberdeen in 1137. With the exception of the episcopate of [[William Elphinstone]] (1484–1511), building progressed slowly. [[Gavin Dunbar (Bishop of Aberdeen)|Gavin Dunbar]], who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. It is now a congregation of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Aberdeen has two other cathedrals: [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Mary's Cathedral]] is a [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral in [[Gothic style]], erected in 1859. In addition, [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] serves the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. It was constructed in 1817 as [[Archibald Simpson]]'s first commission and contains a memorial to the consecration of the first bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], which took place nearby. In 1804, [[St Peter's Church, Aberdeen|St Peter's Church]], the first permanent Roman Catholic church in the city after the Reformation was built.&lt;ref name=list&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-19973-st-peter-s-r-c-church-and-presbytery-and- St Peter's R.c.

Numerous other Protestant denominations have a presence in Aberdeen. [[The Salvation Army]] citadel on the Castlegate dominates the view of east end of Union Street. In addition, there is a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church, established in 1833 and located in Skene Terrace. [[Christadelphians]] have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844.

There is also a [[Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre|mosque]] in Old Aberdeen which serves the Islamic community in the city, and an [[Aberdeen Synagogue|Orthodox Jewish Synagogue]] established in 1945. There is also a Thai [[Buddhist]] temple located in the Hazelhead area of the city.

Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the [[oil industry]], which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy. Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the [[Paper mills of Aberdeen|Stoneywood Paper Mill]] with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when [[Richards of Aberdeen]] closed.

Grey granite was [[quarry|quarried]] at [[Rubislaw quarry]] for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]] in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rain water from the quarry with the aim of developing a heritage centre on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|title=Water pumping work starts at Rubislaw Quarry in Aberdeen|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=2012-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713191152/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th century. Catches have fallen because of overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels,&lt;ref name=&quot;harbour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html|title=Aberdeen Harbour: A History of Service|publisher=Aberdeen Harbour Board|accessdate=18 February 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403194640/http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html|archivedate=3 April 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of [[Peterhead]] and Fraserburgh. The [[Fisheries Research Services]] are headquartered in Aberdeen, and there is a marine research lab in Torry.

Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at [[The James Hutton Institute]] (formerly the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute), which has close links to the city's two universities. The [[Rowett Research Institute]] is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of [[life scientists]] working in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowett&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/institute/history.html|title=History and Background|publisher=Rowett Research Institute |accessdate=1 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061229125832/http://www.rowett.ac.uk/institute/history.html| archivedate= 29 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Scientist's guide to Scotland |work=New Scientist |accessdate=9 May 2013 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524852.500-a-scientists-guide-to-scotland.html |archivedate=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202113753/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524852.500-a-scientists-guide-to-scotland.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As oil reserves in the North Sea decrease there is an effort to rebrand Aberdeen as &quot;Energy Capital of Europe&quot; rather than &quot;Oil Capital of Europe&quot;, and there is interest in the development of new energy sources; and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is under way. The &quot;Energetica&quot; initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |title=A burst of energy in Europe's oil capital |work=BBC News |date=12 November 2003 |access-date=18 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727125146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |archive-date=27 July 2004 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Aberdeen remained a major world centre for undersea petroleum technology.&lt;ref name=NYT72813&gt;{{cite news|title=Aberdeen, a City With One Foot on the Seafloor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/business/global/aberdeen-a-city-with-one-foot-on-the-seafloor.html|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 July 2013|author=Stanley Reed|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803031015/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/business/global/aberdeen-a-city-with-one-foot-on-the-seafloor.html|archive-date=3 August 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aberdeen and the North Sea===
Aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the 19th century, when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to [[Peterhead]]. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.

Geologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, {{convert|110|mi}} east of Aberdeen.

By late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.

The industry supports about 47,000 jobs locally, and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century. As a major port in the UK, Aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port. Seafarers' welfare organisation, [[Apostleship of the Sea]] has a port chaplain in Aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them.

{{Main|Architecture of Aberdeen}}

Aberdeen's architecture is known for its principal use during the Victorian era of [[granite]], which has led to its local nickname of the ''Granite City'' or more romantically the less commonly used name the ''Silver City'', since the [[Mica]] in the stone sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where [[sandstone]] has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry. The buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years. There has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their façade being restored back to much how they looked originally.

Amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]], are the Town and County Bank, [[The Music Hall (Aberdeen)|the Music Hall]], the [[Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen|Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades]] (originating between 1398 and 1527, although completely rebuilt in the 1860s), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the [[National Bank of Scotland]]. In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Town House, a very prominent landmark in Aberdeen, built between 1868 and 1873 to a design by Peddie and Kinnear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst6629.html |title=Overview of Town House |publisher=University of Edinburgh |accessdate=25 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714032327/http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst6629.html |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]]'s extension to [[Marischal College]] on Broad Street, opened by King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] in 1906, created the second largest granite building in the world (after the [[Escorial]], Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst1482.html |title=Overview of Marischal College |publisher=University of Edinburgh |accessdate=25 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607084956/http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst1482.html |archive-date=7 June 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the many fine landmark buildings, Aberdeen has many prominent public statues, three of the most notable being [[William Wallace]] at the junction between Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct, [[Robert Burns]] on Union Terrace above [[Union Terrace Gardens]], and Robert the Bruce holding aloft the charter he issued to the city in 1319 on Broad Street, outside [[Marischal College]].

===Parks, gardens and open spaces===

Aberdeen has long been famous for its 45&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; parks and gardens, and citywide floral displays which include two million roses, eleven million daffodils and three million crocuses. The city has won the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Britain in Bloom]] 'Best City' award ten times,&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/floral.html| title=Floral Capital of Scotland|publisher=British Publishing| date=20 February 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401110049/http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/floral.html|archivedate=1 April 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the overall Scotland in Bloom competition twenty times&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; and the large city category every year since 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; However, despite recent spurious reports, Aberdeen has never been banned from the Britain in Bloom competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Maureen| last=Simpson| url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/britaininbloom/scotland/aberdeen2006.asp | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103259/http://www.rhs.org.uk/britaininbloom/scotland/aberdeen2006.asp | archivedate=29 September 2007 | title=We're top of Brit parade| publisher=Press and Journal| date=22 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city won the 2006 Scotland in Bloom &quot;Best City&quot; award along with the International Cities in Bloom award.

[[File:Duthie Park, Aberdeen.JPG|thumb|left|Duthie Park]]

[[Duthie Park]] opened in 1899 on the north bank of the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]]. It was named after and given to the city by Miss Elizabeth Crombie Duthie of Ruthrieston in 1881. It has extensive gardens, a rose hill, boating pond, bandstand, and play area as well as Europe's second largest enclosed gardens the David Welch Winter Gardens. [[Hazlehead Park]], is large and forested, located on the outskirts of the city, it is popular with walkers in the forests, sports enthusiasts, naturalists and picnickers. There are football pitches, two golf courses, a pitch and putt course and a horse riding school.

[[File:Union Terrace Gardens, Aberdeen.JPG|thumb|Union Terrace Gardens]]

Aberdeen's success in the Britain in Bloom competitions is often attributed to [[Johnston Gardens]], a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. In 2002, the garden was named the best garden in the [[British Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; [[Seaton Park]], formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of [[St Machar's Cathedral]]. The Cathedral Walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display. The park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this. [[Union Terrace Gardens]] opened in 1879 and is situated in the centre of the city. It covers {{convert|2.5|acre|ha}} in the centre of Aberdeen bordered on three sides by Union Street, Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct. The park forms a natural amphitheatre located in the Denburn Valley and is an oasis of peace and calm in the city centre. A recent proposal to build a three-storey concrete and steel superstructure in place of the gardens, part of which will provide a commercial concourse, has proved highly controversial. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Situated next to each other, [[Victoria Park, Aberdeen|Victoria Park]] and [[Westburn Park]] cover {{convert|26|acre|ha}} between them. [[Victoria Park, Aberdeen|Victoria Park]] opened in 1871. There is a conservatory used as a seating area and a fountain made of fourteen different granites, presented to the people by the granite polishers and master builders of Aberdeen. Opposite to the north is [[Westburn Park]] opened in 1901. With large grass pitches it is widely used for field sports. There is large tennis centre with indoor and outdoor courts, a children's cycle track, play area and a grass boules lawn.

[[Aberdeen Airport]] (ABZ), at [[Dyce]] in the north of the city, serves domestic and international destinations including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Scandinavian countries. The heliport which serves the oil industry and rescue services is one of the world's busiest commercial heliports.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAA&quot;/&gt;

[[Aberdeen railway station]] is on the main UK rail network and [[Abellio ScotRail]] has frequent direct trains to major cities [[Edinburgh]], Glasgow and [[Inverness]]. [[London North Eastern Railway]] and the [[Caledonian Sleeper]] operate direct trains to London. The station is being updated to bring it into the modern age.{{when|date=December 2017}} In 2007 additions were made and a new ticket office was built in the building. The UK's longest direct rail journey runs from Aberdeen to [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]]. It is operated by [[CrossCountry]], leaving Aberdeen at 08:20 and taking 13 hours and 23 minutes. Today, all railway services to the south run via Dundee. The faster main line from Aberdeen to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] via [[Forfar]] and [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]] closed in 1967 as a result of the [[Beeching cuts]], and the faster main line from Perth to Edinburgh via [[Glenfarg]] also subsequently closed in 1970.

Until 2007, a 1950s-style concrete bus station at Guild Street served out-of-the-city locations; it has since transferred to a new and well-presented bus station just 100&amp;nbsp;metres to the east off Market Street as part of the [[Union Square Aberdeen|Union Square]] development.

There are six major roads in and out of the city. The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to [[Edinburgh]], Dundee, [[Brechin]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the south and [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire|Ellon]], [[Peterhead]] and [[Fraserburgh]] in the north. The A96 links [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Inverness]] and the north west. The A93 is the main route to the west, heading towards Royal Deeside and the [[Cairngorms]]. After [[Braemar]], it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west, through [[Westhill, Aberdeenshire|Westhill]] and on to [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]]. The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, and is now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Arbroath]] and on the east coast. The A947 exits the city at [[Dyce]] and goes on to [[Newmachar]], [[Oldmeldrum]] and [[Turriff]] finally ending at [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]].

Aberdeen is connected to the UK [[National Cycle Network]], and has a track to the south connecting to cities such as Dundee and Edinburgh and one to the north that forks about &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;{{convert|10|mi|km|round=5}}&lt;/span&gt; from the city into two different tracks heading to Inverness and Fraserburgh respectively. Two popular footpaths along old railway tracks are the [[Deeside Way]] to [[Banchory]] (which will eventually connect to Ballater) and the [[Formartine and Buchan Way]] to Ellon, both used by a mixture of cyclists, walkers and occasionally horses. Four park-and-ride sites serve the city: Stonehaven and Ellon (approx {{convert|12|to|17|mi|km}} out from the city centre) and Kingswells and Bridge of Don (approx {{convert|3|to|4|mi|km|0}} out).

The Dee Estuary, Aberdeen's harbour, has continually been improved. Starting out as a fishing port, moving onto steam trawlers, the oil industry, it is now a major port of departure for the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Aberdeen |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/27 27–28] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/27 |date= |accessdate=7 September 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major exports include fertiliser, granite, and chemicals.

Aberdeen has two universities, the ancient ''[[University of Aberdeen]]'', and ''[[Robert Gordon University]]'', a modern university often referred to as RGU. Aberdeen's student rate of 11.5% is higher than the national average of 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Education&amp;mainLevel=CouncilArea&amp;mainArea=Aberdeen+City&amp;mainText=&amp;mainTextExplicitMatch=null&amp;compLevel=CountryProfile&amp;compArea=Scotland&amp;compText=&amp;compTextExplicitMatch=null |title=Comparative Education Profile: Aberdeen City Council Area, Scotland |accessdate=21 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213314/https://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Education&amp;mainLevel=CouncilArea&amp;mainArea=Aberdeen+City&amp;mainText=&amp;mainTextExplicitMatch=null&amp;compLevel=CountryProfile&amp;compArea=Scotland&amp;compText=&amp;compTextExplicitMatch=null |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Aberdeen]] began as [[King's College, Aberdeen]], which was founded in 1495&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; by [[William Elphinstone]] (1431–1514), [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] and Chancellor of Scotland. [[Marischal College]], a separate institution, was founded in &quot;New&quot; Aberdeen by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; These institutions were merged by order of Parliament in 1860 to form the University of Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; The university is the fifth oldest in the English-speaking world&lt;ref name=&quot;university&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jennifer|last=Carter|title=Crown and Gown: Illustrated History of the University of Aberdeen, 1495–1995|year=1994|location=Aberdeen|publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers degrees in a full range of disciplines. Its main campus is in Old Aberdeen in the north of the city and it currently has approximately 14,000 students. The university's debating society is the oldest in Scotland, founded in 1848 as the King's College Debating Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aberdeen University Debater|url=http://www.thedebater.org/about|publisher=Aberdeen University Debater|accessdate=13 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917031002/http://www.thedebater.org/about/|archivedate=17 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Aberdeen is consistently ranked among the top 200 universities in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/node/2162/ranking-details/world-university-rankings/2014|title=University of Aberdeen Rankings|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=2015-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920155518/https://www.topuniversities.com/node/2162/ranking-details/world-university-rankings/2014|archive-date=20 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ranked within the top 30 universities in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2019|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625164636/http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings/|archive-date=25 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nuk-tnl-editorial-prod-staticassets.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/bespoke/university-guide/index.html|title=University Guide 2016 - The Times|website=nuk-tnl-editorial-prod-staticassets.s3.amazonaws.com|access-date=2018-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112081423/http://nuk-tnl-editorial-prod-staticassets.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/bespoke/university-guide/index.html|archive-date=12 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberdeen was also named the 2019 Scottish University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/12263/|title=University of Aberdeen named Scottish University of the Year {{!}} News {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921153227/https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/12263/|archive-date=21 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Gordon's College]] (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1750 by the merchant [[Robert Gordon (philanthropist)|Robert Gordon]],&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became [[Robert Gordon University]]. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It was previously ''The Sunday Times'' Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: &quot;With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Times'', 12 September 2010 (subscription only).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RGU Riverside East building 1.jpg|thumb|Sir Ian Wood building, Robert Gordon University]]

RGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at [[Garthdee]] and currently has approximately 15,500 students. As of 2013, the Garthdee campus was expanded to include all schools, with the Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street campus being sold to Robert Gordon's College, and the building now functions as the school's Science and Technology Centre. The closure of the Schoolhill site includes the removal of the Student Union building, giving Aberdeen the dubious distinction of having two universities but no student bar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Aberdeen College - geograph.org.uk - 852689.jpg|thumb|left|North East Scotland College]]

Aberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: [[Gray's School of Art]], founded in 1886, which is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK. [[Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and Built Environment]], was one of the first architectural schools to have its training courses recognised by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]. Both are now part of [[Robert Gordon University]] and are based at its Garthdee campus. [[North East Scotland College]] has several campuses in the city and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications in science. The [[Scottish Agricultural College]] is based just outside Aberdeen, on the Craibstone Estate. This is situated beside the roundabout for Aberdeen Airport on the A96. The college provides three services—Learning, Research and Consultancy. The college features many land based courses such as Agriculture, Countryside Management, Sustainable Environmental Management and Rural Business Management. There are a variety of courses from diplomas through to master's degrees. The [[Marine Laboratory Aberdeen]], which specialises in fisheries, [[Macaulay Land Use Research Institute]] (soil science), and the [[Rowett Research Institute]] (animal nutrition) are some other higher education institutions.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The Aberdeen College of Performing Arts also provides full-time Drama and Musical Theatre training at Further Education level.

{{Main|Mid Northern Scots}}

The local dialect of [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] is often known as ''Doric'', and is spoken not just in the city, but across the north-east of Scotland. It differs somewhat from other Scots dialects most noticeable are the pronunciation ''f'' for what is normally written ''wh'' and ''ee'' for what in standard English would usually be written ''oo'' (Scots ''ui''). Every year the annual Doric Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedoricfestival.com |title=The Doric Festival |publisher=The Doric Festival |accessdate=25 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091235/http://www.thedoricfestival.com/ |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Aberdeenshire to celebrate the history of the north-east's language.
