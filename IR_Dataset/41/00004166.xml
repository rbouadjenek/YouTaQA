'''William Ernest Walsh''' (November 30, 1931 – July 30, 2007) was an [[American football]] coach. He served as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford Cardinal football team]], during which time he popularized the [[West Coast offense]]. After retiring from the 49ers, Walsh worked as a sports broadcaster for several years and then returned as head coach at Stanford for three seasons.

Walsh went 102–63–1 (wins-losses-ties) with the 49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship]] titles, and three [[Super Bowls]]. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. In 1993, he was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Los Angeles]], Walsh played running back in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for [[Hayward High School]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]].&lt;ref name=&quot;semtyh&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/30/BAG57LR8OK21.DTL | title=Former 49er head coach Bill Walsh dies | first=Tom | last=Fitzgerald | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=July 30, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112203709/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F07%2F30%2FBAG57LR8OK21.DTL | archivedate=November 12, 2007 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Walsh played [[quarterback]] at the [[College of San Mateo]] for two seasons.  (Both [[John Madden]] and Walsh played and coached at the College of San Mateo early in their careers.)  After playing at the College of San Mateo, Walsh transferred to [[San José State University]], where he played [[tight end]] and [[defensive end]]. He also participated in intercollegiate [[boxing]], winning the golden glove. 

Walsh graduated from San Jose State with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physical education]] in 1955. After two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] participating on their boxing team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title=The Story of the 1988 49ers | series=America's Game | series-link=America's Game: The Super Bowl Champions | date=March 8, 2007 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz3OE48jSFw | network=NFL Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh built a championship team at [[Washington High School (Fremont, California)|Washington High School]] in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] before becoming an assistant coach at [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]], [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] and then the [[Oakland Raiders]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Newhouse | title=Bill Walsh: Nov. 30, 1931 – July 30, 2007 | work=Vallejo Times Herald | location=[[Vallejo, California]] | url=http://www.timesheraldonline.com/article/ZZ/20070731/NEWS/707319869 | date=July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early coaching career==
He served under Bob Bronzan as a graduate assistant coach on the [[San José State Spartans|Spartans]] football coaching staff and graduated with a [[master's degree]] in physical education from San Jose State in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=San Jose State Legend Bill Walsh Dies |publisher=[[San Jose State University]] |date=July 30, 2007 |url=http://www.wacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10100&amp;ATCLID=1139580 |accessdate=October 1, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110001159/http://www.wacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10100&amp;ATCLID=1139580 |archive-date=January 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; His master's [[thesis]] was entitled ''Flank Formation Football -- Stress:: Defense''. Thesis 796.W228f.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/billwalsh/ci_6505664 | title=Coaching legend Bill Walsh dies at 75 | author=Daniel Brown, Jon Wilner and Mack Lundstrom | date=July 31, 2007 | work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | accessdate=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation, Walsh coached the football and swim teams at [[Washington High School (Fremont, California)|Washington High School]] in [[Fremont, California]].

Walsh was coaching in Fremont when he interviewed for an assistant coaching position with [[Marv Levy]], who had just been hired as the head coach at the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California, Berkeley]].
&quot;I was very impressed, individually, by his knowledge, by his intelligence, by his personality, and hired him,&quot; Levy said.  Levy and Walsh, two future NFL Hall of Famers, would never produce a winning season at [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]].

After coaching at Cal, Walsh did a stint at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] as an assistant coach, before beginning his pro coaching career.

==Early professional coaching career==
Walsh began his pro coaching career in [[1966 AFL season|1966]] as an assistant with the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[Oakland Raiders]]. As a Raider assistant, Walsh was trained in the vertical passing offense favored by [[Al Davis]], putting Walsh in Davis's mentor [[Sid Gillman#Coaching tree|Sid Gillman's coaching tree]].

In 1967 Walsh was the head coach and general manager of the [[San Jose Apaches]] of the [[Continental Football League]] (CFL). Walsh led the Apaches to 2nd place in the Pacific Division. Prior to the start of the 1968 CFL season the Apaches ceased all football operations.

In [[1968 AFL season|1968]], Walsh moved to the AFL expansion [[Cincinnati Bengals]], joining the staff of legendary coach [[Paul Brown]]. It was there that Walsh developed the philosophy now known as the &quot;West Coast Offense&quot;, as a matter of necessity. Cincinnati's new [[quarterback]], [[Virgil Carter]], was known for his great mobility and accuracy but lacked a strong arm necessary to throw deep passes. Thus, Walsh modified the vertical passing scheme he had learned during his time with the Raiders, designing a horizontal passing system that relied on quick, short throws, often spreading the ball across the entire width of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.milehighreport.com/2009/5/27/886729/bill-walsh-bill-parcells-and-the | title=Bill Walsh, Bill Parcells and the Rise of the Left Tackle | publisher=MileHighReport.com | date=May 27, 2009 | author=Doc Bear}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new offense was much better suited to Carter's physical abilities; he led the league in pass completion percentage in 1971.

Walsh spent eight seasons as an assistant with the Bengals. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] eventually replaced Carter as starting quarterback, and together with star [[wide receiver]] [[Isaac Curtis]], produced a consistent, effective offensive attack. Initially, Walsh started out as the wide receivers coach from 1968 to 1970 before also coaching the quarterbacks from 1971 to 1975.

When Brown retired as head coach following the [[1975 NFL season|1975]] season and appointed [[Bill &quot;Tiger&quot; Johnson]] as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach for [[Tommy Prothro]] with the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. In a 2006 interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sam Farmer | title=Living Legend | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 22, 2006 | page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown &quot;worked against my candidacy&quot; to be a head coach anywhere in the league. &quot;All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.&quot;

In 1977, Walsh was hired as the head coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] where he stayed for two seasons. His two Stanford teams were successful, posting a 9–3 record in 1977 with a win in the [[1977 Sun Bowl (December)|Sun Bowl]], and 8–4 in 1978 with a win in the [[1978 Bluebonnet Bowl|Bluebonnet Bowl]]. His notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks [[Guy Benjamin]] and [[Steve Dils]], wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[Ken Margerum]], linebacker [[Gordy Ceresino]], in addition to running back [[Darrin Nelson]]. Walsh was the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-8 Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1977.

==49ers head coach==
In [[1979 NFL season|1979]], Walsh was hired as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] by owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.]] The long-suffering 49ers went 2–14 in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]], the season before Walsh's arrival and repeated the same dismal record in his first season. But, Walsh got the entire organization to buy into his philosophy and vowed to turn around a miserable situation. He also drafted quarterback [[Joe Montana]] from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the third round. Despite their second consecutive 2-14 record, the 49ers were playing more competitive football.

In [[1980 NFL Season|1980]], [[Steve DeBerg]] was the starting quarterback who got San Francisco off to a 3-0 start, but after a 59-14 blowout loss to Dallas in week 6, Walsh promoted Montana to starting QB. In a Sunday game, December 7 vs. the New Orleans Saints, Montana brought the 49ers back from a 35-7 halftime deficit to win 38-35 in overtime. The 49ers improved to 6–10, but more importantly, Walsh had them making great strides and they were getting better every week.

===1981 championship===
In [[1981 NFL season|1981]], key victories were two wins each over the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The Rams were only two seasons removed from a [[Super Bowl XIV|Super Bowl]] appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers since 1967 winning 23, losing 3 and tying 1. San Francisco's two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until 1998 with 30 wins (including 17 consecutively) against only 6 defeats. The 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' that week, the win was not included in the halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Bill Walsh | title=The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership | publisher=[[Penguin Group]] | year=2009 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 49ers finished the regular season with a 13-3 record.

The 49ers faced the Cowboys again that same season in the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] title game. The game was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys' prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Dwight Clark's touchdown reception, known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]], propelling Walsh to his first Super Bowl. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.

San Francisco won its first championship a year removed from back-to-back two-win seasons. The 49ers won [[Super Bowl XVI]] defeating the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] 26-21 in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].  Under Walsh the team rose from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons.

The 49ers won [[Super Bowl]] championships in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988 seasons]]. Walsh served as 49ers head coach for 10 years, and during his tenure he and his coaching staff perfected the style of play known popularly as the [[West Coast offense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/sports/football/31walsh.html|title=Bill Walsh, Innovator of West Coast Offense, Dies at 75.|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|date=July 31, 2007|work=New York Times|access-date=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh was nicknamed &quot;The Genius&quot; for both his innovative play calling and design. Walsh would regularly script the first 10-15 offensive plays before the start of each game. In the ten years during which Walsh was the 49ers' head coach, San Francisco scored 3,714 points (24.4 per game), the most of any team in the league during that span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/XECxX|title=Pro-Football-Reference.com: In multiple seasons, from 1979 to 1988, in the Regular Season, requiring Underdog By &gt;= 0, sorted by descending Points For.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Joe Montana]], Walsh drafted [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Charles Haley]], and [[Jerry Rice]]. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. His success with the 49ers was rewarded with his election to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Professional Football Hall of Fame]] in 1993.  Montana, Lott, Haley, Rice and Young were also elected to the Hall of Fame.

==Coaching tree==
===Prominent assistant coaches===
Many of Bill Walsh's assistant coaches went on to be head coaches themselves, including [[George Seifert]], [[Mike Holmgren]], [[Ray Rhodes]], and [[Dennis Green]]. After Walsh's retirement from the 49ers, Seifert succeeded him as 49ers head coach, and guided San Francisco to victories in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] and [[Super Bowl XXIX]]. Holmgren won a [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and made 3 Super Bowl appearances as a head coach: 2 with the Packers, and another with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have used Walsh's West Coast system, such as former [[Denver Broncos]] head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] and former [[Houston Texans]] head coach [[Gary Kubiak]]. Mike Shanahan was an offensive coordinator under [[George Seifert]] and went on to win [[Super Bowl XXXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] during his time as head coach of the [[Denver Broncos]]. Kubiak was first a [[quarterback]] coach with the 49ers, then [[offensive coordinator]] for Shanahan with the Broncos. In 2015, he became head coach and led Denver to victory in [[Super Bowl 50]]. [[Dennis Green]] trained [[Tony Dungy]], who won a [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], and [[Brian Billick]] with his brother-in law and linebackers coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]]. Billick won a [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] as head coach of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Mike Holmgren trained many of his assistants to become head coaches, including [[Jon Gruden]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Gruden won a [[Super Bowl XXXVII|Super Bowl]] with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Reid served as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1999-2012, and guided the Eagles to multiple winning seasons and numerous playoff appearances. In addition to this, [[Marc Trestman]], former head coach of the [[Chicago Bears]], served as Offensive Coordinator under Seifert in the 90's. Gruden himself would train [[Mike Tomlin]], who led the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to their [[Super Bowl XLIII|sixth Super Bowl championship]], and [[Jim Harbaugh]], whose 49ers would face his brother, [[John Harbaugh]], whom Reid himself trained, and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] at [[Super Bowl XLVII]], which marked the Ravens' second World Championship.

Bill Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | title=It's past time | author=Glenn Dickey | publisher=ProFootballWeekly.com | date=January 14, 2002 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164442/http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | archivedate=November 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the impact of Walsh also changed the NFL into an equal opportunity for African-American coaches. Along with [[Ray Rhodes]] and [[Dennis Green]], [[Tyrone Willingham]] became the head coach at Stanford, then later [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and Washington. One of [[Mike Shanahan]]'s assistants, [[Karl Dorrell]] went on to be the head coach at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.

===Bill Walsh coaching tree===
Many former and current NFL head coaches trace their lineage back to Bill Walsh on his [[coaching tree]], shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html | title=An offense by any other name ... | author=Len Pasquarelli | publisher=ESPN.com | accessdate=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh, in turn, belonged to the coaching tree of [[American Football League]] great and Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gillman]] of the AFL's [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers]] and Hall of Fame coach [[Paul Brown]].
[[File:Bill Walsh Coaching Tree.svg|center]]

==Later career==
After leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in [[Super Bowl XXIII]], Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], teaming with [[Dick Enberg]] to form the lead broadcasting team, replacing [[Merlin Olsen]].

During his time with NBC, rumors began to surface that Walsh would coach again in the NFL.  There were at least two known instances.

First, according to a February 2015 article by [[Mike Florio]] of NBC Sports,  [[1989 New England Patriots season|after a 5-11 season in 1989, the Patriots]] fired Raymond Berry and unsuccessfully attempted to lure Walsh to Foxborough to become head coach and general manager.  When that failed, New England promoted defensive coordinator Rod Rust; the team [[1990 New England Patriots season|split its first two games and then lost 14 straight in 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/26/recalling-the-raymond-berry-era-and-new-englands-failed-run-at-bill-walsh/&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, late in the 1990 season, Walsh was rumored to become [[1990 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay's]] next head coach and general manager after the team fired [[Ray Perkins]] and promoted [[Richard Williamson (American football)|Richard Williamson]] on an interim basis.  Part of the speculation was fueled by the fact that Walsh's contract with NBC, which ran for 1989 and 1990, would soon be up for renewal, to say nothing of the pressure [[Hugh Culverhouse]] faced to increase fan support and to fill the seats at [[Tampa Stadium]].  However, less than a week after [[Super Bowl XXV]], Walsh not only declined Tampa Bay's offer, but he and NBC agreed on a contract extension.  Walsh would continue in his role with NBC for 1991.  Meanwhile, after unsuccessfully courting then-recently-fired Eagles coach [[Buddy Ryan]] or Giants then-defensive coordinator [[Bill Belichick]] to man the sidelines for Tampa Bay in 1991, the Bucs stuck with Williamson.  Under Williamson's leadership, [[1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay only won thrice in 1991]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-01-31-9101090974-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh did return to Stanford as head coach in 1992, leading the Cardinal to a 10–3 record and a [[Pacific-10 Conference]] co-championship. Stanford finished the season with an upset victory over [[Penn State]] in the [[1993 Blockbuster Bowl|Blockbuster Bowl]] on January 1, 1993 and a #9 ranking in the final [[AP Poll]]. In 1994, after consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford and retired from coaching.

In 1996 Walsh returned to the 49ers as an administrative aide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adding Walsh to the 49ers Could Stir up Trouble|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-24/sports/sp-28018_1_bill-walsh|website=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh was the Vice President and General Manager for the 49ers from [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999]] to [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001]] and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards.

In 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director Ted Leland stepped down, Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater [[San Jose State University]] in their search for an Athletic Director and Head Football Coach in 2005.

Walsh was also the author of three books, a motivational speaker, and taught classes at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].

Walsh was a Board Member for the [[Lott Trophy|Lott IMPACT Trophy]], which is named after [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] defensive back [[Ronnie Lott]], and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year. Walsh served as a keynote speaker at the award's banquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lottimpacttrophy.com/news/article/-you-are-looking-live-at- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527051520/http://www.lottimpacttrophy.com/news/article/-you-are-looking-live-at- |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bill Walsh died of leukemia on July 30, 2007 at his home in [[Woodside, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;semtyh&quot;/&gt;

Following Walsh's death, the playing field at the former [[Candlestick Park]] was renamed &quot;Bill Walsh Field&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Walsh Field&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2969252 | title=49ers home field to be named after Walsh | date=August 10, 2007 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the regular [[San Jose State Spartans football|San Jose State]] versus Stanford football game was renamed the &quot;[[Bill Walsh Legacy Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Walsh Legacy Game&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/12/SPOBS3G79.DTL&amp;type=sports | title=Walsh's legacy all over this game | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle | author=Michelle Smith | date=September 12, 2007 | accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Walsh is survived by his wife Geri, his son Craig and his daughter Elizabeth. Walsh had another son, Steve, who died in 2002.
