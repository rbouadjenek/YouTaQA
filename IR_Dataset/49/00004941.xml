Blood libels typically claim that Jews require human blood for the baking of [[matzo]]s for [[Passover]], although this element was allegedly absent in the earliest cases which claimed that then-contemporary Jews reenacted the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. The accusations often assert that the blood of the children of Christians is especially coveted, and, historically, blood libel claims have been made in order to account for the otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victim of [[human sacrifice]] has become venerated as a [[Christian martyr]]. Three of these{{snd}} [[William of Norwich]], [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]], and [[Simon of Trent]]{{snd}} became objects of local cults and veneration, and in some cases they were added to the [[General Roman Calendar]].{{who|date=May 2019}} One, [[Gabriel of Białystok]], was canonized by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

In Jewish lore, blood libels were the impetus for the creation of the [[Golem#The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague|Golem of Prague]] by Rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/golem.html Angelo S. Rappoport ''The Folklore of the Jews'' (London: Soncino Press, 1937), pp. 195–203] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418003740/http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/golem.html |date=18 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walter Laqueur]]:

{{quote|Altogether, there have been about 150 recorded cases of blood libel (not to mention thousands of rumors) that resulted in the arrest and killing of Jews throughout history, most of them in the Middle Ages. In almost every case, Jews were murdered, sometimes by a mob, sometimes following torture and a trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-530429-2}}. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term 'blood libel' has also been used to refer to any unpleasant or damaging false accusation, and it has taken on a broader metaphorical meaning. However, this usage remains controversial, and Jewish groups have objected to such usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-12176503|title=What does 'blood libel' mean?|author=|date=12 January 2011|accessdate=16 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/the-campaign-spot/term-blood-libel-more-common-you-might-think-jim-geraghty/|title=The Term ‘Blood Libel’: More Common Than You Might Think|author=Jim Geraghty|date=12 January 2011|magazine=National Review|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703583404576079823067585318|title=Sarah Palin Is Right About 'Blood Libel'|first=Shmuley|last=Boteach|date=January 14, 2011|website=wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish law against murder, sacrifice, and consumption of blood==
{{religious text primary|section|date=March 2018}}
{{rquote|right|It has been one of history's cruel ironies that the blood libel — accusations against Jews using the blood of murdered gentile children for the making of wine and matzot — became the false pretext for numerous [[pogrom]]s. And due to the danger, those who live in a place where blood libels occur are [[Halakha|halachically]] exempted from using red wine, lest it be seized as &quot;evidence&quot; against them.|Pesach: What We Eat and Why We Eat It|Project Genesis&lt;ref name=reWineBloodlibel&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutman|first=Rabbi Yisrael|title=Pesach: What We Eat and Why We Eat It|url=http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/passover/pesacheat.html|publisher=Project Genesis Inc.|accessdate=14 April 2013|website=torah.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509103442/http://torah.org/features/holydays/passover/pesacheat.html|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The supposed torture and human sacrifice alleged in the blood libels run contrary to the teachings of Judaism. According to the [[Bible]], God commanded [[Abraham]] in the [[Binding of Isaac]] to sacrifice his son, but He ultimately provided a ram as a substitute. The [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Torah]] forbid murder.  In addition, the use of blood (human or otherwise) in cooking is prohibited by the [[Kashrut|kosher dietary laws]] (kashrut).  Blood from slaughtered animals may not be consumed, and it must be drained out of the animal and covered with earth ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:12-13|31}}). According to the [[Book of Leviticus]], blood from sacrificed animals may only be placed on the altar of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Great Temple in Jerusalem]] (which no longer existed at the time of the Christian blood libels). Furthermore, the consumption of human flesh would violate kashrut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magentzedek.org/?page_id=81 What is [[kashrut]]; ''&quot;Eating blood is forbidden. Blood is blood, whether it comes from a human being or an animal. In prohibiting the consumption of blood, the Torah seems to be concerned that it can excite a blood-lust in human beings and may desensitize us to the suffering of human beings when their blood is spilled.&quot;'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

Also stated in Leviticus is that &quot;it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, in all your settlements: you must not eat any fat or any blood,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+3:17&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Leviticus 3:17 – New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;you must not eat any blood whatever, either of bird or of animal, in any of your settlements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+7:26&amp;version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Leviticus 7:26 – New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[animal sacrifice]] was part of the practice of ancient Judaism, the [[Tanakh]] ([[Old Testament]]) and [[Halakha|Jewish teachings]] portray [[human sacrifice]] as one of the evils that separated the [[Paganism|pagans]] of [[Canaan]] from the Hebrews ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|12:31|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:3|31}}).  Jews were prohibited from engaging in these rituals and they were also punished for doing so ({{bibleverse||Exodus|34:15|31}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:2|31}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:12|31}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|7:31|31}}).  In fact, ritual cleanliness for priests even prohibited them from being in the same room with a human corpse ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|21:11|31}}).&lt;!-- a secondary law that supported the interpretations of the tanakh --&gt;

==History==
The earliest versions of the accusation involved Jews crucifying Christian children on [[Easter]]/[[Passover]] because of a prophecy. There is no reference to the use of blood in unleavened matzo bread, which evolves later as a major motivation for the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Bartrop, Samuel Totten, ''Dictionary of Genocide'', ABC-CLIO, 2007, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible precursors===
The earliest known example of a blood libel is from a certain Damocritus (not [[Democritus|the philosopher]]) only mentioned by the [[Suda]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3408-blood-accusation#3489 BLOOD ACCUSATION] in ''Jewish Encyclopedia''. (Richard Gottheil, Hermann L. Strack, Joseph Jacobs). Accessed 10/31/18. Note that the version of the Jewish Encyclopedia here quoted misspells  the name ''Damocritus'' as ''Democritus'', the name of an unrelated philosopher.&lt;/ref&gt; who alleged that &quot;every seven years the Jews captured a stranger, brought him to the temple in [[Jerusalem]], and sacrificed him, cutting his flesh into bits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patterson2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Patterson|title=Anti-Semitism and Its Metaphysical Origins|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F_1DBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04074-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graeco-Egyptian author [[Apion]] claimed that Jews sacrificed Greek victims in [[Second Temple|their temple]]. This accusation is known from [[Josephus]]' rebuttal of it in ''[[Against Apion]]''. Apion states that when [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus Epiphanes]] entered the temple in Jerusalem, he discovered a Greek captive who told him that he was being fattened for sacrifice. Every year, Apion claimed, the Jews would sacrifice a Greek and consume his flesh, at the same time swearing eternal hatred towards the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Feldman, ''Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World: Attitudes and Interactions from Alexander to Justinian'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1993. pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Apion's claim probably repeats ideas already in circulation because similar claims are made by [[Posidonius]] and [[Apollonius Molon]] in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=Feldmanp1996p293&gt;Feldman, Louis H. ''Studies in Hellenistic Judaism'', Brill, 1996, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns the murder of a Christian boy by a group of Jewish youths. [[Socrates Scholasticus]] ({{floruit}} 5th century) reported that some Jews in a drunken frolic bound a Christian child on a cross in mockery of the death of Christ and scourged him until he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/syriabloodlibel.html |title=Blood libel in Syria |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Israel Jacob Yuval of the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem published an article in 1993 which argues that the blood libel may have originated in the 12th century from Christian views of Jewish behavior during the [[First Crusade]]. Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than be subjected to [[forced conversion]]s. Yuval investigated Christian reports of these events and stated that they were greatly distorted, with claims that, if Jews could kill their own children, they could also kill the children of Christians. Yuval rejects the blood libel story as a fantasy of some Christians which could not contain any element of truth in it due to the precarious nature of the Jewish minority's existence in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/827036.html |title=And if it's not good for the Jews? |author=Lily Galili |work=Haaretz |date=18 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Two Nations in Your Womb: Perceptions of Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' by Israel J.

===Origins in England===
[[File:Death of William of Norwich.jpg|thumb|upright|The crucifixion of William of Norwich depicted on a [[rood screen]] in Holy Trinity church, [[Loddon, Norfolk|Loddon]], Norfolk ]]
{{Main|Harold of Gloucester|Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln|Robert of Bury|William of Norwich}}

In England in 1144, the Jews of [[Norwich]] were falsely accused of [[Human sacrifice|ritual murder]] after a boy, [[William of Norwich]], was found dead with stab wounds in the woods. William's hagiographer, [[Thomas of Monmouth]], falsely claimed that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter, because of a Jewish prophecy that states that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land. In 1144, England was chosen, and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing. They then abducted and crucified William.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Langham |first1=Raphael |title=William of Norwich |url=http://www.jhse.org/node/44?page=0%2C0 |website=The [[Jewish Historical Society of England]] |accessdate=1 July 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203040/http://www.jhse.org/node/44?page=0%2C0 |archivedate=18 July 2011 |date=10 March 2008}};{{br}} Langmuir, Gavin I (1996), ''Toward a Definition of Antisemitism'', University of California Press, pp. 216ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of a martyr and pilgrims bringing offerings to the local church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia|prescript=|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15635a.htm|wstitle=St. William of Norwich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by similar accusations in [[Harold of Gloucester|Gloucester (1168)]], [[Robert of Bury|Bury St Edmunds (1181)]] and Bristol (1183). In 1189, the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was attacked by the crowd. [[History of the Jews in England#Massacres at London and York (1189–90)|Massacres of Jews at London and York]] soon followed. In 1190 on 16 March 150 Jews were attacked in York and then massacred when they took refuge in the royal castle, where Clifford's Tower now stands, with some committing suicide rather than being taken by the mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/norman/the-1190-massacre|title=The 1190 Massacre: History of York|first=SUMO|last=Design|date=|website=www.historyofyork.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of 17 bodies thrown in a well in Norwich between the 12th and 13th century (five that were shown by DNA testing to likely be members of a single Jewish family) were very possibly killed as part of one of these pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13855238 | work=BBC News | title=Jewish bodies found in medieval well in Norwich | date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]], there were trials and executions of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Knight's Tale of Young Hugh of Lincoln&quot;, Gavin I. Langmuir, Speculum, Vol. 47, No. 3 (July 1972), pp. 459–482.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is mentioned by [[Matthew Paris]] and [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. Its notoriety sprang from the intervention of the Crown, the first time an accusation of ritual killing had been given royal credibility.

The eight-year-old Hugh disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was probably discovered on 29 August,  in a well. A Jew named Copin or Koppin confessed to involvement. He confessed to [[John Lexington|John of Lexington]], a servant of the crown, and relative of the Bishop of Lincoln. The church stood to gain from the establishment of a martyr's cult. Copin's confession was probably in return for the promise that his life should be spared. He is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had reached Lincoln at the beginning of October, had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans or Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;See Langmuir (1972), p479; Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&amp;nbsp;192–224&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few decades, Jews would be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657.

===Continental Europe===
[[File:Ritualmord-Legende.jpg|thumb|[[Simon of Trent]] blood libel. Illustration in Hartmann Schedel's Weltchronik, 1493]]

Much like the blood libel of England, the history of blood libel in continental Europe consists of unsubstantiated claims made about the corpses of Christian children. There were frequently associated supernatural events speculated about these discoveries and corpses, events which were often attributed by contemporaries to miracles. Also, just as in England, these accusations in continental Europe typically resulted in the execution of numerous Jews — sometimes even all, or close to all, the Jews in one town. These accusations and their effects also, in some cases, led to royal interference on behalf of the Jews.

Thomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, § 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpré]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote, &quot;It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.&quot; Thomas of Cantimpré also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], &quot;His blood be on us, and on our children&quot; ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages, a condition equated with male menstruation:&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ehrman, &quot;The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,&quot; Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 86&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (&quot;''solo sanguine Christiano''&quot;).' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression &quot;''solo sanguine Christiano''&quot; had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus{{snd}} the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.  Thomas did not mention the name of the &quot;very learned&quot; proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who, in 1240, had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas. Nicholas Donin and another Jewish convert, Theobald of Cambridge, are greatly credited with the adoption and the belief of the blood libel myth in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ehrman, &quot;The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,&quot; Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known case outside England was in [[Blois]], France, in 1171. This was the site of a blood libel accusation against the town's entire Jewish community that led to around 31–33 Jews (with 17 women making up this total&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ehrman, &quot;The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,&quot; Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 85&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Susan L.

The count had the about 40 adult Blois Jews arrested and they were eventually to be burned. The surviving members of the Blois Jewish community, as well as surviving holy texts, were ransomed. As a result of this case, the Jews garnered new promises from the king. The burned bodies of the sentenced Jews were supposedly maintained unblemished through the burning, a claim which is a well-known miracle, martyr myth for both Jews and Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  There is significant primary source material from this case including a letter revealing moves for Jewish protection with [[King Louis VII]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L.

At [[Pforzheim]], [[Baden]], in 1267, a woman supposedly sold a girl to Jews who, according to the myth, then cut her open and dumped her in the [[Enz]] River, where boatmen found her. She apparently cried for vengeance, and then died. The body apparently bled as the Jews were brought to it. The woman and the Jews apparently confessed and were subsequently killed.&lt;ref&gt;Steven K.

A statement was made, in the ''Chronicle'' of [[Konrad Justinger]] of 1423, that at [[Bern]] in 1293&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;Albert Winkler, &quot;The Approach of the Black Death in Switzerland and the Persecution of Jews, 1348–1349,&quot; Swiss American Historical Society Review, Vol. 43, No. 3 (2007): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1294 the Jews tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph  (sometimes also referred to as Rudolph, Ruff, or Ruof). The body was reportedly found by the house of Jöly, a Jew. The Jewish community was then implicated. The penalties imposed upon the Jews included torture, execution, expulsion, and steep financial fines. Justinger argued Jews were out to harm Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;/&gt;    The historical impossibility{{clarify|date=October 2019}} of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler, pastor of Bern, in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Katholische Schweizer-Blätter&quot;, Lucerne, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several explanations put forth as to why these blood libel accusations were made and perpetuated. For example, it has been argued Thomas of Monmouth's account and other similar false accusations, as well as their perpetuation, largely had to do with the economic and political interests of leaders who did, in fact, perpetuate these myths.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Cohen, Review of  The Murder of William of Norwich: The Origins of the Blood Libel in Medieval Europe, by E.M. Rose  Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Vol. 47, No. 3 (Winter 2017): 410.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, it was largely believed in Europe that Jews used Christian blood for medicinal and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Trachtenberg, The Devil and the Jews: The Medieval Conception of the Jew and its Relation to Modern Anti-Semitism.  (Vardo Books, 2001): 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the unsubstantiated, mythical nature of these claims, as well as their sources, they evidently materially impacted the communities in which they occurred including both the Jewish and non-Jewish populations.

[[File:Judensau Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|upright|From an 18th-century etching from Brückenturm. ''Above'': The murdered body of Simon of Trent. ''Below'': The &quot;[[Judensau]]&quot;]]

[[Simon of Trent]], aged two, disappeared, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded locally as a saint, although he was never canonised by the church of Rome. He  was removed from the Roman Martyrology in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]].

Christopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or &quot;the [[Holy Child of La Guardia]]&quot;, was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered by two Jews and three [[converso]]s (converts to Christianity).  In total, eight men were executed.  It is now believed&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James: &quot;Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the defeat of the Moors&quot;, p. 207. Doubleday, 2005. {{ISBN|0-385-50848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this case was constructed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to facilitate the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]]. 

In a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today [[Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.

At Bösing (Bazin, today [[Pezinok]], [[Slovakia]]), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later, when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been taken there by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as a means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin.

In [[Rinn]], near [[Innsbruck]], a boy named [[Andreas Oxner]] (also known as Anderl von Rinn) was said to have been bought by Jewish merchants and cruelly murdered by them in a forest near the city, his blood being carefully collected in vessels. The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century, when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments{{snd}} for example, that the money paid for the boy to his godfather turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave.  The cult continued until officially prohibited in 1994, by the Bishop of Innsbruck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/rinn.html Medieval Sourcebook: A Blood Libel Cult: Anderl von Rinn, d. 1462] www.fordham.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
One of the child-saints in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the six-year-old boy [[Gavriil Belostoksky]] from the village [[Zwierki|Zverki]]. According to the legend supported by the church, the boy was kidnapped from his home during the holiday of [[Passover]] while his parents were away. Shutko, who was a Jew from [[Białystok]], was accused of bringing the boy to Białystok, piercing him with sharp objects and draining his blood for nine days, then bringing the body back to Zverki and dumping it at a local field. A cult developed, and the boy was canonized in 1820. His relics are still the object of pilgrimage.

* 1823–35 [[Velizh]] blood libel:  After a Christian child was found murdered outside of this small Russian town in 1823, accusations by a drunk prostitute led to the imprisonment of many local Jews.

* 1840 [[Damascus affair]]: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant disappeared. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. 
* 1840 [[Rhodes blood libel]]: The Jews of [[Rhodes]], under the [[Ottoman Empire]], were accused of murdering a [[Greeks|Greek]] Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.
* In 1844 [[David Paul Drach]], the son of the Head Rabbi of [[Paris]] and a convert to Christianity, wrote in his book ''De L’harmonie Entre L’eglise et la Synagogue'', that a Catholic priest in Damascus had been ritually killed and the murder covered up by powerful Jews in Europe; referring to the 1840 Damascus affair [See above]
* In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): &quot;While periodicals as diverse in tendency as ''[[Vestnik Evropy|Herald of Europe]]'' and ''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti|Saint Petersburg Notices]]'' expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|New Times]]'' hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Effie Ambler, ''Russian Journalism and Politics: The Career of Aleksei S.

* 1882 [[Tiszaeszlár affair|Tiszaeszlár blood libel]]: The Jews of the village of [[Tiszaeszlár]], Hungary were accused of the ritual murder of a fourteen-year-old Christian girl, Eszter Solymosi. The case was one of the main causes of the rise of antisemitism in the country. The accused persons were eventually acquitted.
* In 1899 [[Hilsner Affair]]: Leopold Hilsner, a [[Czech Jewish]] vagabond, was accused of murdering a nineteen-year-old Christian woman, Anežka Hrůzová, with a slash to the throat.  Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in [[Austria-Hungary]], Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death.  He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman.  In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. [[Tomáš Masaryk]], a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of [[Czechoslovakia]], spearheaded Hilsner's defense. He was later blamed by Czech media because of this. In March 1918, Hilsner was pardoned by Austrian emperor [[Karl of Austria|Charles I]].  He was never exonerated, and the true guilty parties were never found.

* The 1903 [[Kishinev pogrom]], an anti-Jewish revolt, started when an anti-Semitic newspaper wrote that a Christian Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of [[Dubăsari|Dubossary]], alleging that the Jews killed him in order to use the blood in preparation of matzo. Around 49 Jews were killed and hundreds were wounded, with over 700 houses being looted and destroyed.
* In the [[1910 Shiraz blood libel]], the Jews of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged; the pogrom left 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.

* Jews were frequently accused of the ritual murder of Christians for their blood in ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', an antisemitic newspaper published in [[Nazi Germany]].

* During an interview which aired on ''[[Rotana (television)|Rotana Khalijiya TV]]'' on 13 August 2012, Saudi Cleric Salman Al-Odeh stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]) that &quot;It is well known that the Jews celebrate several holidays, one of which is the Passover, or the Matzos Holiday. I read once about a doctor who was working in a laboratory. This doctor lived with a Jewish family. One day, they said to him: 'We want blood. Get us some human blood.' He was confused. He didn't know what this was all about. Of course, he couldn't betray his work ethics in such a way, but he began inquiring, and he found that they were making matzos with human blood.&quot; Al-Odeh also stated that &quot;[Jews] eat it, believing that this brings them close to their false god, [[Yahweh]]&quot; and that &quot;They would lure a child in order to sacrifice him in the religious rite that they perform during that holiday.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3536.htm Saudi Cleric Salman Al-Odeh: Jews Use Human Blood for Passover Matzos], MEMRITV, Clip No. 3536, (transcript), 13 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-cleric-accuses-jewish-people-of-genocide-drinking-human-blood/ Saudi cleric accuses Jewish people of genocide, drinking human blood] by Ilan Ben Zion, ''[[The Times of Israel]]'', 16 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2013, the Palestinian non-profit organization MIFTAH, founded by [[Hanan Ashrawi]] apologized for publishing an article which criticized US President [[Barack Obama]] for holding a [[Passover Seder]] in the [[White House]] by saying &quot;Does Obama in fact know the relationship, for example, between ‘Passover’ and ‘Christian blood’...?! Or ‘Passover’ and ‘Jewish blood rituals?!’ Much of the chatter and gossip about historical Jewish blood rituals in Europe is real and not fake as they claim; the Jews used the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover.&quot; MIFTAH's apology expressed its &quot;sincerest regret.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/04/02/3123361/palestinian-non-profit-belatedly-apologizes-for-blood-libel-article Palestinian non-profit belatedly apologizes for blood libel article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406011957/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/04/02/3123361/palestinian-non-profit-belatedly-apologizes-for-blood-libel-article |date=6 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an interview which aired on [[Al-Hafez|Al-Hafez TV]] on 12 May 2013, Khaled Al-Zaafrani of the Egyptian Justice and Progress Party, stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]): &quot;It's well known that during the Passover, they [the Jews] make matzos called the &quot;Blood of Zion.&quot; They take a Christian child, slit his throat and slaughter him. Then they take his blood and make their [matzos]. This is a very important rite for the Jews, which they never forgo... They slice it and fight over who gets to eat Christian blood.&quot; In the same interview, Al-Zaafrani stated that &quot;The French kings and the Russian czars discovered this in the Jewish quarters. All the massacring of Jews that occurred in those countries were because they discovered that the Jews had kidnapped and slaughtered children, in order to make the Passover matzos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3873.htm Egyptian Politician Khaled Zaafrani: Jews Use Human Blood for Passover Matzos], MEMRITV, Clip No. 3873 (transcript), 24 May 2013 (see also: [http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/3873.htm Video Clip]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/169004#.Ub6MqHFza-8 Egyptian Politician: Jews Use Human Blood for Passover Matzos] by Elad Benari, ''[[Arutz Sheva]]'', 17 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/egyptian-politician-revives-passover-blood-libel/ Egyptian politician revives Passover blood libel] by Gavriel Fiske, ''[[Times of Israel]]'', 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an interview which aired on the [[Al-Quds TV]] channel on 28 July 2014 (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), [[Osama Hamdan]], the top representative of [[Hamas]] in [[Lebanon]], stated that &quot;we all remember how the Jews used to slaughter Christians, in order to mix their blood in their holy matzos.

* In a sermon broadcast on the official [[Jordan Radio and Television Corporation|Jordanian TV channel]] on 22 August 2014, Sheik Bassam Ammoush, a former Minister of Administrative Development who was appointed to Jordan's [[Parliament of Jordan|House of Senate (&quot;Majlis al-Aayan&quot;)]] in 2011, stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]): &quot;In [the [[Gaza Strip]]] we are dealing with the enemies of [[Allah]], who believe that the matzos that they bake on their holidays must be kneaded with blood. When the Jews were in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], they would murder children in England, in Europe, and in America. They would slaughter them and use their blood to make their matzos... They believe that they are [[Jews as the chosen people|God's chosen people]]. They believe that the killing of any human being is a form of worship and a means to draw near their god.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4454.htm Friday Sermon by Former Jordanian Minister: Jews Use Children's Blood for Their Holiday Matzos], [[MEMRI]] Clip No. 4454 (transcript), 22 August 2014.

==Views of the Catholic Church==
The attitude of the [[Catholic Church]] towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time. The [[Pope|Papacy]] generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.

In 1911, the ''[[Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi catholique]]'', an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations.&lt;ref&gt;English translation [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/blood-libel-view-from-1911.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians.  Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] periodical ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'') promoted the blood libel as truth.&lt;ref&gt;As shown by David Kertzer in ''The Popes Against the Jews'' (New York, 2001), pp. 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2018}}  For example, [[Simon of Trent]]'s local status as a saint was removed in 1965. 

===Papal pronouncements===
* [[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: &quot;5 July 1247 Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent accusation of Arabs on similar charges&quot; (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492–1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, pp.&amp;nbsp;188–189, 193–195, 208).  In 1247, he wrote also that &quot;Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;... they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See... Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,... we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations&quot; (''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910), Vol. 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;393–394). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08017a.htm]
* [[Pope Gregory X]] (1271–1276) issued a letter which criticized the practice of blood libels and forbade arrests and persecution of Jews based on a blood libel, ''... unless which we do not believe they be caught in the commission of the crime.''&lt;ref name=&quot;gregx&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.html | title=Medieval Sourcebook: Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel | author=[[Pope Gregory X]] | accessdate=2007-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope Paul III]], in a bull of 12 May 1540, made clear his displeasure at having learned, through the complaints of the Jews of Hungary, Bohemia and Poland, that their enemies, looking for a pretext to lay their hands on the Jews' property, were falsely attributing terrible crimes to them, in particular that of killing children and drinking their blood.
* [[St. Pius V]] in the bull ''Hebraeorum gens sola'' (26 February 1569), by which he expelled Jews from all the cities of the [[Papal States]] except Rome and Ancona,&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Miletto, &quot;The Human Body as a Musical Instrument in the Sermons of Judah Moscato&quot;, in ''The Jewish Body: Corporeality, Society, and Identity in the Renaissance and Early Modern Period'', edited by Giuseppe Veltri and Maria Diemling (Leiden, 2009), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; made multiple accusations of wrong-doing against the Jews, including usury, theft, receiving stolen goods, pimping, divination and magic. He did not mention the blood libel.
* [[Pope Benedict XIV]] wrote the bull ''Beatus Andreas'' (22 February 1755) in response to an application for the formal [[canonization]] of the 15th-century [[Andreas Oxner]], a [[folk saint]] alleged to have been murdered by Jews &quot;out of hatred for the Christian faith&quot;. Benedict did not dispute the factual claim that Jews murdered Christian children, and in anticipating that further cases on this basis would be brought appears to have accepted it as accurate, but decreed that in such cases beatification or canonization would be inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Caffiero, ''Forced Baptisms: Histories of Jews, Christians, and Converts in Papal Rome'', translated by [[Lydia G. Cochrane]] (University of California Press, 2012), pp. 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blood libels in Muslim lands ==
In late 1553 or 1554, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the reigning [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], issued a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (royal decree) which formally denounced blood libels against the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansel |first=Phillip |title=Constantinople: City of the World's Desire, 1453–1924|year= 1998|publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-312-18708-8 |page= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, following the Western outrage arising from the [[Damascus affair]], British politician and leader of the British Jewish community, Sir [[Moses Montefiore]], backed by other influential westerners including Britain's [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] and Damascus consul [[Charles Henry Churchill]],&lt;ref name= Lewis/&gt; the French lawyer [[Isaac Moïse Crémieux|Adolphe Crémieux]], Austrian consul Giovanni Gasparo Merlato, Danish missionary [[John Nicolayson]],&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2 January 2014 | location = Cambridge | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Solomon Munk, persuaded [[Sultan]] [[Abdulmecid I]] in [[Constantinople]], to issue a firman on 6 November 1840 intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the Ottoman Empire. The edict declared that blood libel accusations were a [[slander]] against Jews and they would be prohibited throughout the Ottoman Empire, and read in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth...&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the remainder of the 19th century and into the 20th century, there were many instances of the blood libel in Ottoman lands.&lt;ref name=LewisJews&gt;{{cite book | author=Bernard Lewis | title = The Jews of Islam | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1984 | pages = 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the libel almost always came from the Christian community, sometimes with the connivance of Greek or French diplomats.&lt;ref name=LewisJews/&gt; The Jews could usually count on the goodwill of the Ottoman authorities and increasingly on the support of British, Prussian and Austrian representatives.&lt;ref name=LewisJews/&gt;

In the [[1910 Shiraz blood libel]], the Jews of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged, with the pogrom leaving 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.

In 1983, [[Mustafa Tlass]], the [[Ministry of Defense (Syria)|Syrian Minister of Defense]], wrote and published ''[[Mustafa Tlass#The Matzah of Zion|The Matzah of Zion]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Damascus affair]] of 1840 that repeats the ancient &quot;blood libel&quot;, that [[Jew]]s use the blood of murdered non-Jews in religious rituals such as baking [[Matza]] bread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/15/world/an-anti-jewish-book-linked-to-syrian-aide.html An Anti-Jewish Book Linked to Syrian Aide], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 July 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, he argues that the true religious beliefs of Jews are &quot;black hatred against all humans and religions&quot;, and no Arab country should ever sign a peace treaty with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=adl&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Based on Mixed Sources – Classic Blood Libel: Mustafa Tlas' Matzah of Zion|url=http://www.adl.org/css/mix_blood_libel.asp|publisher=ADL|accessdate=5 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413063812/http://www.adl.org/css/mix_blood_libel.asp|archivedate=13 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tlass re-printed the book several times and stands by its conclusions. Following the book's publication, Tlass told ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', that this accusation against Jews was valid and he also claimed that his book is &quot;an historical study ... based on documents from France, Vienna and the American University in Beirut.&quot;&lt;ref name=adl/&gt;&lt;ref name=HNNblood&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/664.html Blood Libel]  Judith Apter Klinghoffer, ''[[History News Network]]'', 19 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' published a series of articles by [[Osama El-Baz]], a senior advisor to the then Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Among other things, Osama El-Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews. He said that [[Arabs]] and [[Muslim]]s have never been antisemitic, as a group, but he accepted the fact that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews &quot;on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe&quot;. He urged people not to succumb to &quot;myths&quot; such as the blood libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Osama El-Baz |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/focus.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 2–8 January 2003 (Issue No. 619) |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, blood libel stories have appeared in modern times on many occasions in the state-sponsored media of a number of Arab and Muslim nations, their television shows and websites, and books which allege instances of the Jewish blood libels are not uncommon there.&lt;ref&gt;Antisemitic blood libel in the modern world:
*In 1986, Defense Minister of [[Syria]] [[Mustafa Tlass]] authored the book ''The Matzah of Zion''. The book renews the anti-Jewish ritual murder accusations of 1840 [[Damascus affair]] and alleges that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is a factual document. (Frankel, Jonathan. ''The Damascus Affair: &quot;Ritual Murder&quot;, Politics, and the Jews in 1840'', pp. 418, 421. Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-521-48396-4}})
* In 2001 an [[Egypt]]ian film company produced and aired a film titled ''Horseman Without a Horse'', partly based on Tlass's book.
* The Syrian TV series ''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' (&quot;The Diaspora&quot;) depicts Jews engaging in a conspiracy to rule the world, murder Christian children, and use their blood to bake [[matzah]].

In 2007, Lebanese poet, Marwan Chamoun, in an interview aired on [[Télé Liban]], referred to the &quot;... slaughter of the priest Tomaso de Camangiano ... in 1840... in the presence of two rabbis in the heart of Damascus, in the home of a close friend of this priest, Daud Al-Harari, the head of the Jewish community of Damascus.
