'''''Banacek''''' is an American detective [[Television programs|TV series]] starring [[George Peppard]] that aired on the [[NBC]] network from 1972 to 1974. The series was part of the rotating ''[[The NBC Mystery Movie|NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie]]'' anthology. It alternated in its time slot with several other shows, but was the only one of them to last beyond its first season.

==Premise==
Peppard played Thomas Banacek, a suave, [[Polish-American]] freelance [[Private investigator|investigator]] based in [[Boston]], who solved seemingly impossible thefts (see [[locked room mystery]]). He then collected from the insurance companies 10% of the insured value of the recovered property. One of Banacek's verbal signatures was the quotation of strangely worded yet curiously cogent &quot;[[Poland|Polish]]&quot; proverbs such as:
* &quot;If you're not sure that it's potato [[borscht]], there could be orphans working in the mines.&quot;
* &quot;Though the hippopotamus has no sting in its tail, the wise man would prefer to be sat upon by the bee.&quot;
* &quot;A truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a unicorn.&quot;
* &quot;When a wolf is chasing your sleigh, throw him a raisin cookie, but don't stop to bake a cake.&quot;
* &quot;Just because the cat has her kittens in the oven doesn't make them biscuits.&quot;
* &quot;You can read all the books in the library my son, but the cheese will still smell after four days.&quot;
* &quot;No matter how warm the smile on the face of the Sun, the cat still has her kittens under the porch.&quot;
* &quot;Even a one thousand zloty note cannot tap dance.&quot;

Part of the joke was that Ralph Manza as Banacek's [[chauffeur]] Jay Drury, would often ask &quot;What does it mean, Boss?&quot; Banacek also had a running agreement with his chauffeur for a 10% share of Banacek's 10% if he solved the crime.  Mr. Drury was never at a loss for a potential solution which Banacek would always manage to shoot down with his very next line.  Another recurring gag was for other characters to mispronounce his name, often, particularly in the case of rivals, deliberately. The name &quot;Banaczek&quot; (as pronounced in the show) is actually quite rare in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polish Surnames Database|url=http://nazwiska-polskie.pl/Banaczek|website=nazwiska-polskie.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also featured were [[Murray Matheson]] as rare-bookstore owner and information source Felix Mulholland and [[Christine Belford]] as Carlie Kirkland, Banacek's sometime-lover and always-rival. Felix was the series' only character to ever call Banacek by his first name.

Banacek's success as an investigator allowed him to live well. He had a mansion at 85 Mt. Vernon Street, (the second Harrison Gray Otis house and the same house used in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' starring [[Steve McQueen]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063688/locations|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} on Beacon Hill in Boston.  He had a limousine and driver. He owned and drove an antique 1941 [[Packard]] convertible.  He had a [[mobile radio telephone]] in each of his cars at a time when these devices were uncommon and expensive.  Banacek was intelligent, well-educated, cultured and suave.  He was an unapologetic ladies man who enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but he was street-smart and could engage in violent hand-to-hand fighting if the moment called for it; in one episode he mentions having learned combat judo in the marine corps (Peppard really did serve in the [[United States Marine Corps]], rising to the rank of corporal while he was enlisted).

''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' premise had been that a bored, wealthy Boston businessman (McQueen) masterminds a crime, leading to a match of wits with an insurance investigator ([[Faye Dunaway]]) who collects a 10 percent fee from the insurance company if she solves the case. ''Banacek'' borrowed elements of both characters and plot points.

==Production==
In general, the series was shot on the [[Universal Studios]] backlot, though location scenes were filmed around Los Angeles in areas that could pass for Boston, or rural areas near there.  The episode titled &quot;If Max Is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?&quot; was shot on location at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] around the time the school first opened. &quot;Ten Thousand Dollars A Page&quot; was filmed at the Pasadena Art Museum, later known as the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art and now the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]].

A customized 1969 [[American Motors]] AMX was built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the second regular-season episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.barris.com/carsgallery/tvmovie/amx400.php |title='Banacek' AMX 400 |work=Barris Custom |date=2013 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car became known as the [[AMC AMX#AMX-400|AMX-400]] and it is now owned by an automobile collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/amx-400-custom-car.htm |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=AMX-400: Profile of a Custom Car |date=23 September 2007 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other continuing cars in the series were a 1941 [[Packard 180]] with a Victoria body designed by Howard &quot;Dutch&quot; Darrin (license plate number 178344),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rmsothebys.com/mb08/vintage-motor-cars-of-meadow-brook/lots/1942-packard-one-eighty-convertible-victoria-by-darrin/291964 |title=1942 Packard One-Eighty Convertible Victoria by Darrin |work=Sothebys |date=2 August 2008  |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1973 Corvette (driven by Ms. Kirkland) and a 1973 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[limousine]] ([[mobile telephone]] number KL 17811).  In keeping with both the exotic car theme and the humor between Banacek and his driver Jay Drury, he was even chauffeured around in a  [[Willys MB]], [[Jeep CJ]]2A,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle.php?id=146267 |title=Willys MB 'Jeep' |work=imcdb.org |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a CJ6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_243643-Jeep-CJ-6.html |title=Jeep CJ-6  |work=imcdb.org |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a brand new Ford/[[De Tomaso Pantera]].

In preparation for both the pilot, first, and then the second seasons, the cast went to Boston and filmed a variety of background scenes.  These scenes were then used through the series and are especially shown in the opening scenes, including Banacek rowing on the [[Charles River]] and walking through [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]].  In the pilot, Banacek's car pulls into his Beacon Hill home, the historic [[Second Harrison Gray Otis House]] located at 85 Mount Vernon Street. In other episodes, views are shown of the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Public Garden]], the entry to Felix's bookstore at 50 [[Beacon Street]], and the [[Esplanade, Boston|Esplanade]].  The Boston-filmed pieces were done by a [[second unit]] and directed by Peppard himself.

==Reception==
Although the show had a mixture of humor and rather intricate plots, it never generated strong ratings. Despite this, the show was well received by critics. In addition, the [[Polish American Congress]] gave the series an award for portraying Polish Americans in a good manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
''Banacek'' was well received by television critics, and as a result was picked up for a third season. However, before the third season could start, Peppard quit the show to prevent his ex-wife [[Elizabeth Ashley]] from receiving a larger percentage of his earnings as part of their divorce settlement. The complication ended any chance of reviving ''Banacek'' during Peppard's lifetime. [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] continued rebroadcasts of ''Banacek'' in syndication.

==In popular culture==
The [[mentalism|mentalist]] Steven Shaw adopted his stage name &quot;[[Banachek]]&quot; after the television program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Draper|first1=Paul|title=Banachek LIVE Video Q&amp;A on Full Circle Magic, Streamed on Nov. 19, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxT5mwqgqsg|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=14 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, ''Banacek'' was the subject of an episode-length parody in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (&quot;Homer Is Where The Art Isn't&quot;), referencing items from the series' storytelling format to its establishing shots, including Goldenberg's theme music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Dennis|title=Bill Hader helps The Simpsons stick it to that Banacek guy, who must work there or something|url=https://www.avclub.com/bill-hader-helps-the-simpsons-stick-it-to-that-banacek-1823872344|website=The AV Club|publisher=Onion, Inc.|accessdate=March 20, 2018|date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
