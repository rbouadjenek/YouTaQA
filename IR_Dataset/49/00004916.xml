'''Bundaberg Rum''' is a dark [[rum]] produced in [[Bundaberg]], [[Queensland]], Australia, by the '''Bundaberg Distilling Company'''. It is often referred to as &quot;Bundy&quot;. In 2010, the Bundaberg Distilling Company was inducted into the [[Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leaders.slq.qld.gov.au/inductees/|title=Hall of Fame|website=[[Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame]]|publisher=[[State Library of Queensland]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023083836/http://leaders.slq.qld.gov.au/inductees/|archive-date=23 October 2018|url-status=live|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Queensland State Archives 324 Bundaberg Rum Distillery Burnett River Bundaberg c 1931.png|thumb|left|Bundaberg Rum Distillery, Burnett River, Bundaberg., Circa 1931.]]
Bundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste [[molasses]] after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, T Austin, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of [[pound sterling|£]]5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bundy A Centenary History|first=Keith|last=Dunstan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bundaberg Distilling Company began its operations in 1888.

Bundaberg rum was first produced in 1889, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby [[Burnett River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Julia|last=Robinson|title=Voices of Queensland: words from the sunshine state|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christsen Pty Ltd operated their own Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg at the rear of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current &quot;Bundy Bottle&quot;. It originated from the Bushells Coffee Chicory bottle that Bundaberg residents sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from [[the Salvation Army]] faith in the rum bottling process as they were less likely to be tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.

In 1961, the company introduced the [[polar bear]] as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/explore/distillery/chapter/03 |title=Bundaberg Rum website – history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195147/http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/explore/distillery/chapter/03 |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Bundaberg Rum company and [[Distillation|distillery]] were sold to British company [[Diageo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.just-drinks.com/news/diageo-acquires-bundaberg-rum-from-bundaberg-sugar-group-ltd_id78650.aspx |title=Diageo acquires Bundaberg Rum from Bundaberg Sugar Group Ltd|author=Diageo PLC|publisher=Just-Drinks|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213221626/http://www.just-drinks.com/news/diageo-acquires-bundaberg-rum-from-bundaberg-sugar-group-ltd_id78650.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014|date=6 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a decision by Diageo to relocate the bottling operations of Queensland's iconic drink, &quot;Bundaberg Rum&quot;, to the western Sydney suburb of [[Huntingwood, New South Wales|Huntingwood]] resulted in local job losses in the city that bears its name. The decision drew criticism from all levels of Queensland politics:
* Premier Campbell Newman said it was a disappointing move, particularly in a region that had suffered devastating floods in recent years.&lt;ref name=Atfield&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/workers-sacked-as-bundaberg-rum-bottling-moves-to-sydney-20140517-38glq.html|title=Workers sacked as Bundaberg Rum bottling moves to Sydney|first=Cameron|last=Atfield|date=18 May 2014|newspaper=Brisbane Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607175745/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/workers-sacked-as-bundaberg-rum-bottling-moves-to-sydney-20140517-38glq.html |archivedate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bundaberg mayor Mal Forman said &quot;I'm saddened by the announcement, but I had been assured the company had a commitment to the city&quot;.
* Cr Forman said &quot;I understood demand for bottled Bundaberg Rum had declined as more people bought pre-mixed cans, a trend I wanted no part of&quot;.

Later a Diageo spokeswoman clarified by saying &quot;Some premium products, such as the Master Distillers Collection, would continue to be bottled in Bundaberg. This was not a decision we have taken lightly, however it is a necessary one to ensure the longer term sustainability of the distillery. We remain absolutely committed to Bundaberg and the distillery and will continue to invest and focus on our core business of distilling, maturing and blending great quality rum in Bundaberg as we have done for the last 125 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=Atfield/&gt;

The Bundaberg Rum distillery is open to visitors for tours of the facility.  There is also a museum which offers free samples of Bundaberg Rum products for visitors in a historic Queenslander house. The '''[[Australia's big things#Queensland|Big Bundy Bottle]]''' is also outside of the bondstore. A new $8.5&amp;nbsp;million visitor centre opened to the public in August 2016 replacing the smaller historic house next door.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/bundy-rum-opens-new-85-million-tourist-centre-in-b/3076595/#/0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bundaberg Rum's Master Distillers' Collective rum was launched, with the first three releases, the 10 Year Old, Port Barrel and Golden Reserve, winning awards in the global stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distillery Profile: Bundaberg Rum|url=http://australianbartender.com.au/2012/11/29/distillery-profile-bundaberg-rum/|publisher=Australian Bartender|accessdate=21 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012044742/http://australianbartender.com.au/2012/11/29/distillery-profile-bundaberg-rum/|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mike|first=Knott|title=Judges wowed by Bundy Rum|url=http://www.news-mail.com.au/news/judges-wowed-by-bundy-rum/1079828/|publisher=NewsMail|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
Bundaberg Rum has also been criticised for targeting its advertising towards young people and boys, through television commercials during [[National Rugby League|NRL]] broadcasts, and other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s720116.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331110022/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s720116.htm|archivedate=31 March 2009|work=ABC Radio National|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=3 November 2002|title=Teenage Boys}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.caan.adf.org.au/newsletter.asp?ContentId=t20060612|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820084415/http://www.caan.adf.org.au/newsletter.asp?ContentId=t20060612 |title=Bundaberg Rum Marketing Challenged in WA|work=Grogwatch|publisher=Community Alcohol Action Network (CAAN)|archivedate=20 August 2006|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of advertisements featuring the Bundaberg Rum bear, a [[polar bear]] known as Bundy R. Bear, were produced by advertising agency [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett]] to align the product 'with a larrikin approach to Australian mateship'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macleod|first1=Duncan|title=Bundy Bear – Bundaberg Rum Mascot|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2006/bundaberg-rum-bundy-bear/|website=The Inspiration Room|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=19 August 2006|quote=Bundaberg Rum, a product of Queensland, Australia, has a polar bear for a mascot, Bundy R. Bear. Bundy has starred in a number of television advertisements}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bundaberg Rum bear first appeared in 1961. It was designed to soften rum's aggressive image and broaden its appeal from the traditional older male drinker to a more sociable audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMahon|first1=Brett|title=50th Birthday of Bundy R.
