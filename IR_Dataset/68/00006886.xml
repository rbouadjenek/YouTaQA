The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as ''&quot;Checagou&quot;'' was by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de LaSalle]] around 1679 in a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quaife|first=Milo M.|title=Checagou: From Indian Wigwam to Modern City, 1673–1835|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.151734|year=1933|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill|oclc=1865758}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Joutel]], in his journal of 1688, noted that the eponymous wild &quot;garlic&quot; grew abundantly in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson, John F. 235–248&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swenson, John F. |title = Chicagoua/Chicago: The origin, meaning, and etymology of a place name |journal=Illinois Historical Journal |volume = 84 |issue = 4 |date = Winter 1991 |pages = 235–248 |issn = 0748-8149 |oclc = 25174749}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his diary of late September 1687:

The city has had several nicknames throughout its history, such as the [[Origin of Chicago's &quot;Windy City&quot; nickname|Windy City]], Chi-Town, Second City, and City of the Big Shoulders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liebling's Second City&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sarah S.

In the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by the [[Potawatomi]], a Native American tribe who had succeeded the [[Miami people|Miami]] and [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sauk and Fox]] peoples in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Keating|first = Ann Durkin|title = Chicagoland: City and Suburbs in the Railroad Age|year = 2005|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|isbn = 0-226-42882-6|lccn = 2005002198|page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago was explorer [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]]. Du Sable was of [[African people|African]] and French descent and arrived in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Genzen | first = Jonathan|title = The Chicago River: A History in Photographs|year = 2007|publisher = Westcliffe Publishers|isbn = 978-1-56579-553-2|lccn = 2006022119|pages = 10–11, 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=30–31, 221}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=John W|title=Jean Baptiste Point de Sable—The Founder of Modern Chicago|url=http://www.earlychicago.com/essays.php?essay=7|work=Early Chicago|publisher=Early Chicago, Inc.|access-date=August 8, 2010|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is commonly known as the &quot;Founder of Chicago&quot;.

In 1795, following the victory of the new United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]], an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the US for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the [[Treaty of Greenville]]. In 1803, the [[United States Army]] built [[Fort Dearborn]]. This was destroyed in 1812 in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] by the British and their native allies. It was later rebuilt.{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=16–17}}

After the [[War of 1812]], the [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe]], and Potawatomi tribes ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1816)|Treaty of St. Louis]]. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the [[Treaty of Chicago]] in 1833 and sent west of the Mississippi River during [[Indian Removal]].{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=22–23, 68, 80–81}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=30–32}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline: Early Chicago History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: Early Chicago History |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/timeline/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325102159/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/timeline/index.html |work=Chicago: City of the Century |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation And Window to the World Communications, Inc. |archivedate=March 25, 2009 |year=2003 |access-date=May 26, 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of about 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline: Early Chicago History&quot; /&gt; Within seven years it grew to more than 6,000 people. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales began with [[Edmund Dick Taylor]] as U.S. Senator of Public Monies. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11480.html|title=Act of Incorporation for the City of Chicago, 1837|publisher=State of Illinois|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for several decades was the world's fastest-growing city.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Nugent. &quot;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/962.html Demography]&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''. Chicago Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the site of the [[Chicago Portage]],{{sfnp|Keating|2005|p=27}} the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], and the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] opened in 1848. The canal allowed [[steamboat]]s and [[sailing ship]]s on the [[Great Lakes]] to connect to the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=86–98}}{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=30–31}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=24–25}}{{sfnp|Keating|2005|pp=26–29, 35–39}}

A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conzen |first=Michael P. |chapter=Global Chicago |chapter-url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300132.html |title=Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (established 1848) listed the first-ever standardized &quot;exchange-traded&quot; forward contracts, which were called [[futures contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmegroup.com/company/history/timeline-of-achievements.html |title=Timeline-of-achievements |publisher=[[CME Group]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]]]]
In the 1850s, Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator [[Stephen Douglas]], the champion of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] and the &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Douglas|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/spcl/excat/douglas5.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, [[Abraham Lincoln]], to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for US President at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]], which was held in Chicago in a temporary building called the [[Wigwam (Chicago)|Wigwam]]. He defeated Douglas in the general election, and this set the stage for the [[American Civil War]].

To accommodate [[Chicago#Demographics|rapid population growth]] and demand for better sanitation, the city improved its infrastructure. In February 1856, Chicago's Common Council approved [[Ellis S. Chesbrough|Chesbrough]]'s plan to build the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |title=Chicago Daily Tribune, Thursday Morning, February 14 |publisher=nike-of-samothrace.net |accessdate=May 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325060713/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |archivedate=March 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project [[Raising of Chicago|raised much of central Chicago]] to a new grade. While elevating Chicago, and at first improving the city's health, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the [[Chicago River]], and subsequently into [[Lake Michigan]], polluting the city's primary freshwater source.

The city responded by tunneling {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} out into Lake Michigan to newly built [[Water cribs in Chicago|water cribs]]. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] that connects to the [[Illinois River]], which flows into the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=15–18, 243–245}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=27–29, 38–43}}{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=154–155, 172–173, 204–205}}

In 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed an area about {{convert|4|mi|km}} long and {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} wide, a large section of the city at the time.{{sfnp|Buisseret|1990|pp=148–149}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=32–37}}{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=87–97}} Much of the city, including railroads and [[Union Stock Yard|stockyards]], survived intact,{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|p=99}} and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone. These set a precedent for worldwide construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruegmann |first=Robert |chapter=Built Environment of the Chicago Region |chapter-url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/181.html |title=Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |accessdate=December 5, 2013|authorlink=Robert Bruegmann |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=9–11}} During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's [[Home Insurance Building|first skyscraper]] in 1885, using [[steel frame|steel-skeleton]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen|first=Frederick E.|date=February 2003 |title=Where They Went to See the Future |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220103637/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml |archivedate=February 20, 2007 |journal=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |volume=54 |issue=1 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=121, 129}}

The city has grown significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920, with the largest annexation happening in 1889, with five townships joining the city, including the [[Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hyde Park Township]], which now comprises most of the [[South Side of Chicago]] and the far southeast of Chicago, and the [[Jefferson Township, Cook County, Illinois|Jefferson Township]], which now makes up most of [[Northwest Side, Chicago|Chicago's Northwest Side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/53.html|accessdate=December 14, 2015|year=2005|encyclopedia=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Cain, Louis P.|title=Annexations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to join the city was driven by municipal services that the city could provide its residents.

Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from [[Europe]] and migrants from the [[Eastern United States]]. Of the total population in 1900, more than 77% were either foreign-born or born in the United States of foreign parentage. [[Germans]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Poles]], [[Swedes]] and [[Czechs]] made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago: Population |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31156/31156-h/31156-h.htm#ar148|encyclopedia=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labor history of the United States|Labor conflicts]] followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the [[Haymarket affair]] on May 4, 1886, and in 1894 the [[Pullman Strike]]. Anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating very large and highly organized labor actions. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] to found [[Hull House]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Hull House Maps Its Neighborhood |chapter-url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410008.html|title=Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that were developed there became a model for the new field of [[social work]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hullhouse&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Mary Ann |chapter=Hull House |chapter-url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/615.html |title=Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later, state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of [[cholera]], [[smallpox]], and [[yellow fever]] were both passed and enforced. These laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Clinton |last=Sandvick |year=2009 |title=Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877–1890 |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |pmid=19562006 |pmc=2701151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city established many large, well-landscaped [[Chicago Park District|municipal parks]], which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate for improving public health in Chicago was [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D.]] Rauch established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866. He created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves, and in 1867, in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health. Ten years later, he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William K. |last=Beatty |year=1991 |title=John H.

In the 1800s, Chicago became the nation's railroad hub, and by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43–49, 58, 318–319}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Holland-Classic|pages=66–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, Chicago's railway managers needed a general time convention, so they developed the standardized system of North American [[time zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=United States.

In 1893, Chicago hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] on former marshland at the present location of [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The Exposition drew 27.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors, and is considered the most influential [[world's fair]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicago's Rich History |url=http://www.choosechicago.com/attendees/about_chicago/Pages/chicago_history.aspx |publisher=Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610015848/http://www.choosechicago.com/attendees/about_chicago/Pages/chicago_history.aspx |archive-date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Lowe|2000|pp=148–154, 158–169}} The [[University of Chicago]], formerly at another location, moved to the same South Side location in 1892.

During [[World War I]] and the 1920s there was a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from the [[Southern United States]].

The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when [[Prohibition]] was repealed.

Chicago was the first American city to have a homosexual-rights organization. The organization, formed in 1924, was called the [[Society for Human Rights]]. It produced the first American publication for homosexuals, ''[[Friendship and Freedom]]''. Police and political pressure caused the organization to disband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: Milestones in the American Gay Rights Movement|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/stonewall/|work=PBS|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression brought unprecedented suffering to Chicago, in no small part due to the city's heavy reliance on heavy industry. Notably, industrial areas on the south side and neighborhoods lining both branches of the Chicago River were devastated; by 1933 over 50% of industrial jobs in the city had been lost, and unemployment rates amongst blacks and Mexicans in the city were over 40%. The Republican political machine in Chicago was utterly destroyed by the economic crisis, and every mayor since 1931 has been a Democrat. From 1928 to 1933, the city witnessed a tax revolt, and the city was unable to meet payroll or provide relief efforts. Unemployed workers, relief recipients, and unpaid schoolteachers held huge demonstrations during the early years of the Great Depression. The fiscal crisis was resolved by 1933, and at the same time, federal relief funding began to flow into Chicago and enabled the city to complete construction of Lake Shore Drive, landscape numerous parks, construct 30 new schools, and build a thoroughly modernized State Street Subway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Depression&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Depression|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/542.html|website=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was also a hotbed of labor activism, with [[Unemployed Councils]] contributing heavily in the early depression to create solidarity for the poor and demand relief, these organizations were created by socialist and communist groups. By 1935 the [[Workers Alliance of America]] begun organizing the poor, workers, the unemployed. In the spring of 1937 Republic Steel Works witnessed the [[Memorial Day massacre of 1937]] in the neighborhood of East Side.

====1940 to 1979====
When general prosperity returned in 1940, Chicago had an entrenched Democratic machine, a fully solvent city government, and a population that had enthusiastically shared mass culture and mass movements. Over one-third of the workers in Chicago's manufacturing sector were unionized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Depression&quot;/&gt; During [[World War II]], the city of Chicago alone produced more steel than the United Kingdom every year from 1939 - 1945, and more than [[Nazi Germany]] from 1943 - 1945. The city's diversified industrial base made it second only to Detroit in the value—$24 billion—of war goods produced. Over 1,400 companies produced everything from field rations to parachutes to torpedoes, while new aircraft plants employed 100,000 in the construction of engines, aluminum sheeting, bombsights, and other components. The Great Migration, which had been on pause due to the Depression, resumed at an even faster pace in the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|second wave]], as hundreds of thousands of blacks from the South arrived in the city to work in the steel mills, railroads, and shipping yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1384.html|website=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1942, physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] conducted the world's first controlled [[Chicago Pile-1|nuclear reaction]] at the [[University of Chicago]] as part of the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]].

Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was elected in 1955, in the era of [[political machine|machine politics]]. In 1956, the city conducted its last major expansion when it annexed the land under O'Hare airport, including a small portion of DuPage County.

By the 1960s, white residents in several neighborhoods left the city for the suburban areas – in many American cities, a process known as [[white flight]] – as Blacks continued to move beyond the [[Black Belt (region of Chicago)|Black Belt]]. While home loan discriminatory [[redlining]] against blacks continued, the real estate industry practiced what became known as [[blockbusting]], completely changing the racial composition of whole neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehlhorn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehlhorn|first=Dmitri|title=A Requiem for Blockbusting: Law, Economics, and Race-Based Real Estate Speculation|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=67|issue=|pages=1145–1161|date=December 1998|url= |doi= |id= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural changes in industry, such as globalization and job outsourcing, caused heavy job losses for lower-skilled workers.

===Topography===
[[File:Full chicago skyline.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown and the North Side with beaches lining the waterfront]]

Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of freshwater [[Lake Michigan]]. It is the principal city in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area|Chicago metropolitan area]], situated in both the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]]. The city rests on a [[continental divide]] at the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] [[drainage basin|watersheds]]. In addition to it lying beside Lake Michigan, two rivers—the [[Chicago River]] in downtown and the [[Calumet River]] in the industrial far South Side—flow either entirely or partially through the city.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=5–6}}{{sfnp|Genzen|2007|pp=6–9}}

Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge [[lake freighter]]s use the city's [[Port of Chicago|Lake Calumet Harbor]] on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect: moderating Chicago's climate, making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angel|first=Jim|title=State Climatologist Office for Illinois|url=http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/general/chicago-climate-narrative.htm|work=Illinois State Water Survey|publisher=[[Prairie Research Institute]]|access-date=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Chicago was founded in 1837, most of the early building was around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html |title=Thompson's Plat of 1830 |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |year=2004 |access-date=July 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423202023/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html |archive-date=April 23, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall [[Land grading|grade]] of the city's central, built-up areas is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is {{convert|579|ft|+1|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. While measurements vary somewhat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chipublib.org/blogs/post/the-elevation-of-chicago-a-statistical-mystery/ |title=The Elevation of Chicago: A Statistical Mystery |website=Chicago Public Library |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest points are along the lake shore at {{convert|578|ft|+1|abbr=on}}, while the highest point, at {{convert|672|ft|abbr=on}}, is the morainal ridge of [[Beverly, Chicago|Blue Island]] in the city's far south side.&lt;ref name=neiu&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Facts|url=http://www.neiu.edu/~jmhemzac/courses/docs/ofs2005-09%20small2.pdf |work=[[Northeastern Illinois University]] |accessdate=August 28, 2013 |page=46 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110213300/https://www.neiu.edu/~jmhemzac/courses/docs/ofs2005-09%20small2.pdf |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Chicago Loop]] is the central business district, Chicago is also a city of [[List of neighborhoods in Chicago|neighborhoods]]. [[Lake Shore Drive]] runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's waterfront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include [[Lincoln Park]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]], and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. There are 24 public [[Chicago beaches|beaches]] across {{convert|26|mi|km|0}} of the waterfront.&lt;ref name=usabeaches&gt;{{cite news|last=Fulton|first=Jeff|title=Public Beaches in Chicago|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/public-beaches-chicago-53741.html|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for [[Navy Pier]], [[Northerly Island]], the [[Museum Campus Chicago|Museum Campus]], and large portions of the [[McCormick Place]] Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings are close to the waterfront.

An informal name for the entire [[Chicago metropolitan area]] is &quot;Chicagoland&quot;, which generally means the city and all its suburbs. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], and eight nearby Illinois counties: [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake]], [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]], [[Grundy County, Illinois|Grundy]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] and [[Kankakee County, Illinois|Kankakee]], and three counties in [[Indiana]]: [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake]], [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter]] and [[LaPorte County, Indiana|LaPorte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/ |title=Chicago Tribune Classifieds map of Chicagoland |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane, and Will counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Region|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|work=EnjoyIllinois.com|publisher=Illinois Department of Tourism|accessdate=August 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928043624/http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]] defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast Facts About The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp|publisher=Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209003914/http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp|archivedate=February 9, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late-1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct [[Community areas in Chicago|community areas]], which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined [[Neighborhoods in Chicago|neighborhoods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetadvisor.com/chicago-cook-county-illinois/questions/list-of-chicago-neighborhoods |title=List of Chicago Neighborhoods – Chicago |publisher=StreetAdvisor |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago and its Neighborhoods|url=http://www.articlecell.com/Article/Chicago-and-its-Neighborhoods/669201|publisher=articlecell|accessdate=March 22, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130410125240/http://www.articlecell.com/Article/Chicago-and-its-Neighborhoods/669201|archive-date=April 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Streetscape===
{{main|Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Chicago's streets were laid out in a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that grew from the city's original townsite plot, which was bounded by Lake Michigan on the east, North Avenue on the north, Wood Street on the west, and 22nd Street on the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/series/curious-city/gulp-how-chicago-gobbled-its-neighbors-109583|title=Gulp! How Chicago Gobbled Its Neighbors|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streets following the [[Public Land Survey System]] section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction (about one street per 200 meters in one direction and one street per 100 meters in the other direction). The grid's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Native American trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.). Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the [[Burnham Plan|Plan of Chicago]], but only the extension of [[Ogden Avenue (Chicago)|Ogden Avenue]] was ever constructed.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=31, 52–53}}

{{Main|Demographics of Chicago}}

During its first hundred years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. In the forty years from 1850 to 1890, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 to over 1&amp;nbsp;million. At the end of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201f.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1900 |publisher=Geography.about.com |access-date=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]], the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its highest ever recorded population of 3.6&amp;nbsp;million for the 1950 census.

From the last two decades of the 19th century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from [[Ireland]], Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including [[Italian Americans|Italians]], [[American Jews|Jews]], [[Polish Americans|Poles]], [[Greek Americans|Greeks]], [[Lithuanian Americans|Lithuanians]], [[Bulgarian Americans|Bulgarians]], [[Albanian Americans|Albanians]], [[Romanian Americans|Romanians]], [[Turkish Americans|Turkish]], [[Croatian Americans|Croatians]], [[Serbian Americans|Serbs]], [[Bosnian Americans|Bosnians]], [[Montenegrin Americans|Montenegrins]] and [[Czech Americans|Czechs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;Lizabeth Cohen, ''Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990; pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial [[working class]], were added an additional influx of [[African-Americans|African Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|American South]]—with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, the great majority of African Americans moving to Chicago settled in a so‑called &quot;[[Black Belt (region of Chicago)|Black Belt]]&quot; on the city's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]].&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; A large number of blacks also settled on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]]. By 1930, two-thirds of Chicago's black population lived in sections of the city which were 90% black in racial composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; Chicago's South Side emerged as United States second-largest urban black concentration, following New York's [[Harlem]]. Today, Chicago's South Side and the adjoining south suburbs constitute the largest black majority region in the entire United States.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

Chicago's population declined in the latter half of the 20th century, from over 3.6 million in 1950 down to under 2.7 million by 2010. By the time of the official census count in 1990, it was overtaken by [[Los Angeles]] as the United States' second largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0413/041337.html| title = It's official: Los Angeles ousts Chicago as No. 2 city | author = Marshall Ingwerson | date = April 13, 1984 | access-date = January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Near West Side holds the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and was once home to [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Studios]], the site of which has been rebuilt as the global headquarters of [[McDonald's]].

The city's distinctive accent, made famous by its use in classic films like ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and television programs like the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit &quot;[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]&quot;, is an advanced form of [[Inland Northern American English]]. This dialect can also be found in other cities bordering the Great Lakes such as [[Cleveland]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Detroit]], and [[Rochester, New York]], and most prominently features a rearrangement of certain vowel sounds, such as the [[Phonological history of English short A|short 'a']] sound as in &quot;cat&quot;, which can sound more like &quot;kyet&quot; to outsiders. The accent remains well associated with the city.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Matthew J. (2004). &quot;New York, Philadelphia, and other northern cities: phonology&quot;.

Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of [[social realism]]. In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', [[Northwestern University]] Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to &quot;''capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people''&quot;. The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of &quot;high-flown romance&quot; and &quot;genteel realism&quot;, needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/448.html|title=Fiction|author=|date=|work=chicagohistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/755.html|title=Literary Cultures|author=|date=|work=chicagohistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create a &quot;city of feeling&quot; out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1390.html|title=Literary Images of Chicago|author=|date=|work=chicagohistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.

At least three short periods in the [[history of Chicago]] have had a lasting influence on [[American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/257.html|title=Chicago Literary Renaissance|author=|date=|work=chicagohistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include from the time of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] to about 1900, what became known as the Chicago Literary Renaissance in the 1910s and early 1920s, and the period of the [[Great Depression]] through the 1940s.

What would become the influential ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine was founded in 1912 by [[Harriet Monroe]], who was working as an [[art]] [[critic]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

''[[Sporting News]]'' named Chicago the &quot;Best Sports City&quot; in the United States in 1993, 2006, and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/feed/2010-10/best-sports-city |title=Sweet home Chicago: Best Sports City 2010 |work=[[Sporting News]] |date=October 2010 |accessdate=December 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022313/http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/feed/2010-10/best-sports-city |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Boston, Chicago is the only city to continuously host major professional sports since 1871, having only taken 1872 and 1873 off due to the Great Chicago Fire. Additionally, Chicago is one of the six cities in the United States to have won championships in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|the four major professional leagues]] and, along with New York and Los Angeles, is one of three cities to have won soccer championships as well. Several major franchises have won championships within recent years&amp;nbsp;– the Bears (1985), the Bulls (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998), the White Sox (2005), the Cubs (2016), the Blackhawks (2010, 2013, 2015), and the Fire (1998). Chicago has the third most franchises in the four major North American sports leagues with five, behind the New York and Los Angeles Metropolitan Areas, and have six top-level professional sports clubs when including [[Chicago Fire FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS).

The city has two [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams: the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the National League play in [[Wrigley Field]] on the North Side; and the [[Chicago White Sox]] of the American League play in [[Guaranteed Rate Field]] on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901 (New York hosted only one between 1958 and early 1962). The two teams have faced each other in a World Series only once: in [[1906 World Series|1906]], when the White Sox, known as the &quot;Hitless Wonders,&quot; defeated the Cubs, 4-2.

The Cubs are the oldest Major League Baseball team to have never changed their city;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Santo |first1=Ron |authorlink1=Ron Santo |last2=Pepe |first2=Phil |authorlink2=Phil Pepe |date=April 1, 2005 |title=Few and Chosen Cubs: Defining Cubs Greatness Across the Eras |series=Few and Chosen |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Triumph Books |chapter=Preface by Phil Pepe |page=[https://archive.org/details/fewchosen00rons/page/ xxi] |isbn=978-1-57243-710-4 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/fewchosen00rons/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; they have played in Chicago since 1871, and continuously so since 1874 due to the Great Chicago Fire. They have played more games and have more wins than any other team in Major League baseball since 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/|title=MLB Teams and Baseball Encyclopedia - Baseball-Reference.com|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have won three World Series titles, including the 2016 World Series, but had the dubious honor of having the two longest droughts in American professional sports: They had not won their sport's title since [[1908 Chicago Cubs season|1908]], and had not participated in a World Series since [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]], both records, until they beat the [[2016 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[2016 World Series]].

The White Sox have played on the South Side continuously since 1901, with all three of their home fields throughout the years being within blocks of one another. They have won three World Series titles (1906, 1917, 2005) and six American League pennants, including the first in 1901. The Sox are fifth in the American League in all-time wins, and sixth in pennants.

The [[Chicago Bears]], one of the last two remaining charter members of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), have won nine [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]], including the 1985 [[Super Bowl&amp;nbsp;XX]]. The other remaining charter franchise, the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], also started out in the city, but is now known as the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The Bears have won more games in the history of the NFL than any other team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/|title=Team Encyclopedias and Records {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only the [[Green Bay Packers]], their longtime rivals, have won more championships. The Bears play their home games at [[Soldier Field]]. Soldier Field re-opened in 2003 after an extensive renovation.

The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The [[Mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The current mayor is [[Lori Lightfoot]]. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. As well as the mayor, Chicago's clerk and treasurer are also elected citywide. The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Council, Your Ward &amp; Alderman|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council takes official action through the passage of [[local ordinance|ordinances]] and resolutions and approves the city budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Government|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/chicagogovt.html|work=City of Chicago|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chicago Police Department]] provides law enforcement and the [[Chicago Fire Department]] provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the city and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] of the State of Illinois court system, or in the [[Northern District of Illinois]], in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois [[State's Attorney]]; in the Federal court it is the United States [[District Attorney|Attorney]].

===Politics===
{{Main|Political history of Chicago}}
During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and labor organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Schneirov 1998, pp 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been &quot;[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]&quot; in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.

Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 19 [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; two Republican has only represented a significant portion of the city twice since 1973, for one term each–[[Robert P. Hanrahan]] from 1973 to 1975, and [[Michael Patrick Flanagan]] from 1995 to 1997.

[[Machine politics]] persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;Montejano 1998, pp 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal &quot;independent&quot; faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest-serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.

Formerly a state legislator representing Chicago and later a US Senator, the city is home of former United States President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]]. The Obamas' residence is located near the University of Chicago in [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] on the city's south side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/07/27/with-michelle-obama-in-town-speculation-about-future-for-their-home/|title=With Michelle Obama In Town, Speculation About Future For Their Home|first=Derrick|last=Blakley|date=|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employee pensions ===
In September 2016, an Illinois state appellate court found that cities do not have an obligation under the [[Constitution of Illinois|Illinois Constitution]] to pay certain benefits if those benefits had included an expiration date under whichever negotiated agreement they were covered. The Illinois Constitution prohibits governments from doing anything that could cause retirement benefits for government workers to be &quot;diminished or impaired.&quot; In this particular case, the fact that the workers' agreements had expiration dates let the city of Chicago set an expiration date of 2013 for contribution to health benefits for workers who retired after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/511012477-appeals-panel-il-governments-can-pare-back-retiree-health-coverage-if-benefits-included-expiration-date|title=Appeals panel: IL governments can pare back retiree health coverage, if benefits included 'expiration date'|last=Bilyk|first=Jonathan|date=September 22, 2016|work=Cook County Record|access-date=April 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Industrial genre ====
The city was paricularly important for the development of the harsh and electronic based music genre known as [[Industrial music|industrial]]. While the genre was created by [[Throbbing Gristle]] in the late 70s originating in the [[United Kingdom]], the Chicago based record label [[Wax Trax! Records|Wax Trax!]] helped establish itself as America's home for the genre. The label first found success with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], with the release of the [[Cold Life|cold life]] single, which entered the [[Dance/Electronic Singles Sales|US Dance charts]] in 1982. The record label later signed many prominant industrial acts, with the most notable being: [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]], [[KMFDM]], [[Front Line Assembly]] and [[Front 242]]. Richard Giraldi of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]] wrote'', &quot;As important as [[Chess Records]] was to blues and soul music, Chicago's Wax Trax imprint was just as significant to the punk rock, new wave and industrial genres.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Giraldi|first=Richard|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/4863427-421/wax-trax-records-long-gone-but-pulse-of-its-music-is-strong.html|title=Wax Trax Records long gone, but pulse of its music is strong|date=April 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=April 17, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010182602/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/4863427-421/wax-trax-records-long-gone-but-pulse-of-its-music-is-strong.html|archivedate=October 10, 2012|pages=21A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago is a major transportation hub in the United States. It is an important component in global distribution, as it is the third-largest inter-modal port in the world after [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;
Madigan 2004, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Chicago has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 26.5 percent of Chicago households were without a car, and increased slightly to 27.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Chicago averaged 1.12 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expressways====
{{Further|Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Seven mainline and four auxiliary [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] ([[Interstate 55 in Illinois|55]], [[Interstate 57|57]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|65]] (only in Indiana), [[Interstate 80 in Illinois|80]] (also in [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 88 (west)|88]], [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|90]] (also in [[Indiana Toll Road|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 94 in Illinois|94]] (also in [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|190]], [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|290]], [[Interstate 294|294]], and [[Interstate 355|355]]) run through Chicago and its suburbs. Segments that link to the city center are named after influential politicians, with three of them named after former U.S.&amp;nbsp;Presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan) and one named after two-time Democratic candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].

====Transit systems====
[[File:Chicago (ILL) Union Station, great Hall, 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chicago Union Station]], opened in 1925, is the third-busiest passenger rail terminal in the United States]]
The '''[[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTA)''' coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.
* The '''[[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA)''' handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a [[rapid transit]] elevated and subway system known as the [[Chicago &quot;L&quot;|'L']] (for &quot;elevated&quot;), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airports]]. The CTA's rail lines consist of the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]], [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]], [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]], [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Yellow]] lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24‑hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of two in the United States, the other being New York City) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.
* '''[[Metra]]''', the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line [[commuter rail]] service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The [[Metra Electric Line]] shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]], which provides commuter service between [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Chicago.
* '''[[Pace (transit)|Pace]]''' provides bus and [[paratransit]] service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm &quot;New Yorkers are top transit users&quot;], by Les Christie,''CNNmoney.com'', June 29, 2007. Retrieved September 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greyhound Lines]] provides inter-city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of [[Megabus (North America)]].

====Passenger rail====
[[File:20110821 AmtrakEmpireBuilder.jpg|thumb|[[Amtrak]] train on the [[Empire Builder]] route departs Chicago from [[Chicago Union Station|Union Station]]]]
'''[[Amtrak]]''' long distance and [[commuter rail]] services originate from [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, [[Indianapolis]], New Orleans, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St.&amp;nbsp;Louis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], Boston, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], Los Angeles, and [[San Antonio]]. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the [[Chicago&amp;nbsp;– New York Electric Air Line Railroad]]. Parts of this were built, but it was never completed.

===Utilities===
Electricity for most of [[northern Illinois]] is provided by [[Commonwealth Edison]], also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders [[Iroquois County, Illinois|Iroquois County]] to the south, the [[Wisconsin]] border to the north, the [[Iowa]] border to the west and the [[Indiana]] border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of [[Exelon]]) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power.
