{{Greek Alphabet|letter=alpha}}
'''Alpha''' (uppercase {{Script|Grek|'''Α'''}}, lowercase {{Script|Grek|'''α'''}}; {{lang-grc|ἄλφα}}, ''álpha'', &lt;small&gt;modern pronunciation&lt;/small&gt; ''álfa'') is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 1.

It was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Hebrew]] letter [[Aleph (letter)|aleph]] [[Image:phoenician aleph.svg|20px|Aleph]] - an [[ox]] or [[leader]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iwWuY9tAVq8C Chambers concise dictionary] p.30 Allied Publishers, 2004 {{ISBN|9798186062363}} Retrieved 2017-02-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Letters that arose from alpha include the [[Latin script|Latin]] [[A]] and the [[Cyrillic]] letter [[A (Cyrillic)|А]].

In English, the noun &quot;alpha&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;beginning&quot;, or &quot;first&quot; (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alpha Alpha - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Greek===
In [[Ancient Greek]], alpha was pronounced {{IPAblink|ä|a}} and could be either [[phoneme|phonemically]] long ([aː]) or short ([a]). Where there is ambiguity, long and short alpha are sometimes written with a [[Macron_(diacritic)|macron]] and [[breve]] today: Ᾱᾱ, Ᾰᾰ.
*[[wikt:ὥρα#Ancient Greek|ὥρα]] = ὥρᾱ ''hōrā'' {{IPA-el|hɔ́ːraː}} &quot;a time&quot;
*[[wikt:γλῶσσα#Ancient Greek|γλῶσσα]] = γλῶσσᾰ ''glôssa'' {{IPA-el|ɡlɔ̂ːssa}} &quot;tongue&quot;

In [[Modern Greek]], [[vowel length]] has been lost, and all instances of alpha simply represent {{IPA-el|a|IPA}}.

In the [[polytonic Greek|polytonic]] orthography of Greek, alpha, like other vowel letters, can occur with several diacritic marks: any of three accent symbols ({{lang|grc|ά, ὰ, ᾶ}}), and either of two breathing marks ({{lang|grc|ἁ, ἀ}}), as well as combinations of these. It can also combine with the [[iota subscript]] ({{lang|grc|ᾳ}}).

====Greek grammar====
In the [[Attic Greek|Attic]]–[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect of Ancient Greek, long alpha {{IPA|[aː]}} fronted to {{IPAblink|ɛː}} ([[eta]]). In Ionic, the shift took place in all positions. In Attic, the shift did not take place after [[epsilon]], [[iota]], and [[rho]] (ε, ι, ρ; ''e'', ''i'', ''r''). In [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], long alpha is preserved in all positions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek grammar for colleges''. [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm#30 paragraph 30] and [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_notes.htm#30D note].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Doric, Aeolic, Attic {{lang|grc|χώρᾱ}} ''chō&amp;#769;rā'' — Ionic {{lang|grc|χώρη}} ''chō&amp;#769;rē, &quot;country&quot;
*Doric, Aeolic {{lang|grc|φᾱ&amp;#769;μᾱ}} ''phā&amp;#769;mā'' — Attic, Ionic {{lang|grc|φήμη}} ''phē&amp;#769;mē, &quot;report&quot;

[[Privative a]] is the [[Ancient Greek]] prefix ἀ- or ἀν- ''a-'', ''an-'', added to words to negate them. It originates from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''{{PIE|n̥-}}'' ([[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] nasal) and is [[cognate]] with English ''un-''.

[[Copulative a]] is the Greek prefix ἁ- or ἀ- ''ha-'', ''a-''. It comes from Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|sm&amp;#805;}}''.

===Mathematics and science===
{{main|Alpha (disambiguation)}}
The letter alpha represents various concepts in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], including [[alpha radiation]], [[angular acceleration]], [[alpha particle]]s, [[alpha carbon]] and strength of [[electromagnetic interaction]] (as [[Fine-structure constant]]). Alpha also stands for [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of a [[Chemical compound|compound]] in [[physical chemistry]]. It is also commonly used in [[mathematics]] in [[algebra|algebraic solutions]] representing quantities such as angles. Furthermore, in mathematics, the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a [[Normal distribution|normal curve]] in [[statistics]] to denote [[statistical significance|significance level]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu.au/WebStat/unit_materials/c5_inferential_statistics/what_alpha_level.html |work=Research Methods and Statistics PESS202 Lecture and Commentary Notes |title=Chapter 5: Analysing the Data Part II : Inferential Statistics |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822143239/http://www.une.edu.au/WebStat/unit_materials/c5_inferential_statistics/what_alpha_level.html |archivedate=22 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when proving [[null hypotheses|null]] and [[Alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]]. In zoology, it is used to name the dominant individual in a wolf or dog pack. In aerodynamics, the letter is used as a symbol for the [[angle of attack]] of an aircraft and the word &quot;alpha&quot; is used as a synonym for this property.

The proportionality operator &quot;[[∝]]&quot; (in [[Unicode]]: U+221D) is sometimes mistaken for alpha.

The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|Latin A]].

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the letter ɑ, which looks similar to the lower-case alpha, represents the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==History and symbolism==

===Etymology===
Alpha was derived from ''[[aleph]]'', which in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] means &quot;[[ox]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=alpha alpha] on the Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plutarch===
[[Plutarch]], in ''[[Moralia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Symposiacs, Book IX, questions II &amp; III [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 On-line text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013230602/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 |date=13 October 2008 }} at Adelaide library&lt;/ref&gt; presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a [[Boeotia]]n, has to say for [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n who reputedly settled in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]]—which, unlike [[Hesiod]],&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (see on [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0132:card=405 Perseus Project]), advises the early Greek farmers, &quot;First of all, get a house, then a woman and third, an ox for the plough.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities. &quot;Nothing at all,&quot; Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by [[Lamprias]], his own grandfather, than by [[Dionysus]]' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is &quot;alpha&quot;, because it is very plain and simple—the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue—and therefore this is the first sound that children make.

According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]].

===Alpha and Omega===
[[Image:Memorial Stained Glass, Yeo Hall, Chapel, Royal Military College of Canada 605 Oliver Tiffany &amp; 203 Williiam Bermingham.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Memorial Stained Glass window, [[Royal Military College of Canada]] features [[Alpha and Omega]]]]
Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something. The New Testament has God declaring himself to be the &quot;[[Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8). Because of this symbolism, the characters &lt;code&gt;⍺&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;⍵&lt;/code&gt; denote the left and right arguments in the [[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]].

===Language===
{{further|Alpha (ethology)}}
The term &quot;alpha&quot; has been used to denote position in social hierarchy, examples being &quot;[[alpha male]]s&quot; or pack leaders.
