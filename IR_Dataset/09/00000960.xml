{{Aramaeans}}
The ancient '''Aramaic alphabet''' was adapted from the [[Phoenician alphabet]] and became a distinct script by the 8th century BC. It was used to write the [[Aramaic language]] and had displaced the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], itself a derivative of the Phoenician alphabet, for the writing of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The letters all represent [[consonant]]s, some of which are also used as ''[[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'' to indicate long [[vowel]]s.

The Aramaic [[alphabet]] is historically significant since virtually all [[modern history|modern]] [[Middle East]]ern writing systems can be traced back to it as well as numerous non-[[Chinese characters|Chinese]] writing systems of Central and East Asia. That is primarily from the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the official language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] Empires, and their successor, the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Among the scripts in modern use, the [[Hebrew alphabet]] bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BC, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes. The Aramaic alphabet was an ancestor to the Nabataean alphabet and the later Arabic alphabet.

Writing systems (like the Aramaic one) that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of ''matres lectionis'' or added diacritical signs, have been called [[abjad]]s by [[Peter T. Daniels]] to distinguish them from alphabets, such as the [[Greek alphabet]], which represent vowels more systematically. The term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a [[syllabary]] or an alphabet, which would imply that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary (as argued by [[Ignace Gelb]]) or an incomplete or [[defective script|deficient alphabet]] (as most other writers have said). Rather, it is a different type.

==Origins==
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual Greek and Aramaic inscription by the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] at [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]], 3rd century BC.]]
The earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Inland Syria and the East-of-Jordan Region in the First Millennium BCE before the Assyrian Intrusions'', Mark W. Chavalas, The Age of Solomon: Scholarship at the Turn of the Millennium, ed. Lowell K. Handy, (Brill, 1997), 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. Aramaic gradually became the ''lingua franca'' throughout the Middle East, with the script at first complementing and then displacing [[Assyrian cuneiform]], as the predominant writing system.

== Achaemenid Empire (The First Persian Empire) ==
Around 500 BC, following the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of [[Mesopotamia]] under [[Darius I]], [[Old Aramaic]] was adopted by the Persians as the &quot;vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast Persian empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed as Official Aramaic, Imperial Aramaic or Achaemenid Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenid Persians in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic&lt;!-- pp 250–261 --&gt;&lt;!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp 251–252--&gt;|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250–261}} p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was inevitably influenced by [[Old Persian]]. The Aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles, the &quot;lapidary&quot; form, usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments, and a cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to Phoenician and early Aramaic. Both were in use through the Achaemenid Persian period, but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary, which had largely disappeared by the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenfield|first1=J.C.|editor1-last=Gershevitch|editor1-first=I.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran: Volume 2|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=709–710|chapter=Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stele Salm Louvre AO5009.jpg|thumb|Stele with dedicatory lapidary Aramaic inscription to the god Salm. Sandstone, 5th century BC. Found in [[Tayma]], [[Saudi Arabia]] by Charles Huber in 1884 and now in the [[Louvre]].]]

For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BC, Imperial Aramaic, or something near enough to it to be recognisable, would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. The Aramaic script would survive as the essential characteristics of the Iranian [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1|location=Boston|publisher=Adamant|pages=249ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

30 Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been recently discovered, an analysis of which was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC in the Persian Achaemenid administration of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria|series=Studies in the Khalili Collection|last1=Naveh|first1=Joseph|last2=Shaked|first2=Shaul|isbn=978-1-874780-74-8|publisher=Khalili Collections|location=Oxford|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread usage of Achaemenid Aramaic in the Middle East led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing [[Hebrew]]. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of Phoenician, the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]].

===Aramaic-derived scripts===
Since the evolution of the Aramaic alphabet out of the Phoenician one was a gradual process, the division of the world's alphabets into the ones derived from the Phoenician one directly and the ones derived from Phoenician via Aramaic is somewhat artificial. In general, the alphabets of the Mediterranean region (Anatolia, Greece, Italy) are classified as Phoenician-derived, adapted from around the 8th century BC, and those of the East (the Levant, Persia, Central Asia and India) are considered Aramaic-derived, adapted from around the 6th century BC from the Imperial Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Empire.

After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the unity of the Imperial Aramaic script was lost, diversifying into a number of descendant cursives.

The Hebrew and [[Nabataean alphabet]]s, as they stood by the [[Roman era]], were little changed in style from the Imperial Aramaic alphabet. [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) alleges that not only the old Nabataean writing was influenced by the &quot;Syrian script&quot; (i.e. Aramaic), but also the old Chaldean script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ibn Khaldun |first=|author-link=Ibn Khaldun |title=[[The Muqaddimah]] (K. Ta'rikh - &quot;History&quot;) |editor=F. Rosenthal |volume=3 |edition= |date=1958 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London |page=283 |language=en |oclc=643885643}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[cursive Hebrew]] variant developed from the early centuries AD, but it remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the noncursive. By contrast, the cursive developed out of the Nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing Arabic, evolving into the [[Arabic alphabet]] as it stood by the time of the early [[Islamic conquests|spread of Islam]].

The development of cursive versions of Aramaic also led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrene alphabet|Palmyrene]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s, which formed the basis of the historical scripts of Central Asia, such as the [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]] and [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]] alphabets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kara1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=György|last=Kara|chapter=Aramaic Scripts for Altaic Languages|editors=Daniels, Peter T.; Bright, William|title=The World's Writing Systems|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195079937/page/535 535–558]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7|title-link=The World's Writing Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Turkic script]] is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in Aramaic,&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian beginnings: The origin of the cuneiform writing system in comparative perspective'', Jerold S. Cooper, ''The First Writing: Script Invention as History and Process'', ed. Stephen D. Houston, (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tristan James Mabry, ''Nationalism, Language, and Muslim Exceptionalism'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kara1996&quot;/&gt; in particular via the [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] or [[Sogdian alphabet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Turks'', A. Samoylovitch, '''First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936''', Vol. VI, (Brill, 1993), 911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George L. Campbell and Christopher Moseley, ''The Routledge Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets'', (Routledge, 2012), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; as suggested by [[Vilhelm Thomsen|V. Thomsen]], or possibly via  [[Kharoṣṭhī|Kharosthi]] (''cf''., [[Issyk inscription]]).

Aramaic is also considered to be the most likely source of the [[Brahmi script]], ancestor of the [[Brahmic family of scripts]], which includes [[Devanagari]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Languages using the alphabet==
Today, [[Biblical Aramaic]], Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the Aramaic language of the [[Talmud]] are written in the modern-Hebrew alphabet (distinguished from the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Old Hebrew]] script). In classical [[Jewish literature]], the name given to the modern-Hebrew script was &quot;Ashurit&quot; (the ancient Assyrian script),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Tractate Megillah 1:8|title=Mishnah |editor-last1=Danby|editor-first1=H. |editor-link1=Herbert Danby |volume= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|place=London|page=202 (note 20) |year=1964|oclc=977686730 }} ([https://archive.org/details/DanbyMishnah/page/n231/mode/1up ''The Mishnah'', p. 202 (note 20)])&lt;/ref&gt; a script now known widely as the Aramaic script.&lt;ref name=&quot;SteinerRC1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steiner|first=R.C.|author-link=Richard C.

[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is written in the [[Mandaic alphabet]]. The near-identity of the Aramaic and the classical Hebrew alphabets caused Aramaic text to be typeset mostly in the standard Hebrew script in scholarly literature.

===Maaloula===
{{further|Western Neo-Aramaic}}
In [[Maaloula]], one of few surviving communities in which a [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] dialect is still spoken, an Aramaic institute was established in 2007 by [[Damascus University]] that teaches courses to keep the language alive. The institute's activities were suspended in 2010 amidst fears that the square Aramaic alphabet used in the program too closely resembled the square script of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and all the signs with the square Aramaic script were taken down. The program stated that they would instead use the more distinct [[Syriac alphabet]], although use of the Aramaic alphabet has continued to some degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;institute&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0402/Easter-Sunday-A-Syrian-bid-to-resurrect-Aramaic-the-language-of-Jesus-Christ |title=Easter Sunday: A Syrian bid to resurrect Aramaic, the language of Jesus Christ |last=Beach |first=Alastair |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jazeera Arabic also broadcast a program about Western Neo-Aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rbrZ1W2nAs|title=أرض تحكي لغة المسيح|first=|last=Al Jazeera Documentary الجزيرة الوثائقية|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matres lectionis===
{{Main|Mater lectionis}}

In Aramaic writing, Waw and Yodh serve a double function. Originally, they represented only the consonants ''w'' and ''y'', but they were later adopted to indicate the long vowels ''ū'' and ''ī'' respectively as well (often also ''ō'' and ''ē'' respectively). In the latter role, they are known as ''{{lang|la|matres lectionis}}'' or &quot;mothers of reading&quot;.

Ālap, likewise, has some of the characteristics of a ''{{lang|la|mater lectionis}}'' because in initial positions, it indicates a [[glottal stop]] (followed by a vowel), but otherwise, it often also stands for the long vowels ''ā'' or ''ē''. Among Jews, the influence of Hebrew often led to the use of Hē instead, at the end of a word.

The practice of using certain letters to hold vowel values spread to Aramaic-derived writing systems, such as in Arabic and Hebrew, which still follow the practice.
