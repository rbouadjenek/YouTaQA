'''Ataxia''' is a [[neurological sign]] consisting of lack of voluntary [[Motor coordination|coordination of muscle movements]] that can include [[gait abnormality]], speech changes, and abnormalities in eye movements. Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.&lt;ref&gt;dystaxia. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 09 March 2014, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dystaxia&lt;/ref&gt; The word is from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''α-'' [a negative prefix] + ''-τάξις'' [order] = &quot;lack of order&quot;.

=== Cerebellar ===
{{See also|Cerebellar ataxia}}
The term [[cerebellar ataxia]] is used to indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in [[motor planning]]. Although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar [[lesion]]s, many conditions affecting the [[cerebellum]] do produce ataxia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmahmann&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmahmann JD | title = Disorders of the cerebellum: ataxia, dysmetria of thought, and the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–378 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15377747 | doi = 10.1176/jnp.16.3.367 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  People with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force, range, direction, velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8036-0093-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Fredericks CM | chapter = Disorders of the Cerebellum and Its Connections | veditors = Saladin LK, Fredericks CM | title = Pathophysiology of the motor systems: principles and clinical presentations | publisher = F.A.

People with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance, which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform [[tandem gait]]. As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schmahmann&quot; /&gt; Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As cerebellar ataxia becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schmahmann&quot; /&gt; [[Dysarthria]], an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by &quot;scanning&quot; speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm and variable volume.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schmahmann&quot; /&gt; There may also be slurring of speech, tremor of the voice and [[ataxic respiration]]. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. There is overshooting (or hypermetria) with finger to nose testing, and heel to shin testing; thus, [[dysmetria]] is evident.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schmahmann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Godaux E, Jacquy J | title = Cerebellar hypermetria is larger when the inertial load is artificially increased | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–52 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8285591 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410350108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairments with alternating movements ([[dysdiadochokinesia]]), as well as [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], may also be displayed. There may also be tremor of the head and trunk ([[titubation]]) in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schmahmann&quot; /&gt;

It is thought that [[dysmetria]] is caused by a deficit in the control of interaction [[torque]]s in multijoint motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10805697&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastian AJ, Zackowski KM, Thach WT | title = Cerebellar ataxia: torque deficiency or torque mismatch between joints? | journal = J. Neurophysiol. | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 3019–3030 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10805697 | doi =  10.1152/jn.2000.83.5.3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved. For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement [[velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s.
* '''[[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]]''' ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid [[titubation]] (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based &quot;drunken sailor&quot; [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia),&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenfeld&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = 670–671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps. As a result of this gait impairment, [[falling (accident)|falling]] is a concern in patients with ataxia. Studies examining falls in this population show that 74–93% of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to 60% admit to fear of falling.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20157791&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonteyn EM, Schmitz-Hübsch T, Verstappen CC, Baliko L, Bloem BR, Boesch S, Bunn L, Charles P, Dürr A, Filla A, Giunti P, Globas C, Klockgether T, Melegh B, Pandolfo M, De Rosa A, Schöls L, Timmann D, Munneke M, Kremer BP, van de Warrenburg BP | title = Falls in spinocerebellar ataxias: Results of the EuroSCA Fall Study | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–239 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20157791 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-010-0155-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15645525&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van de Warrenburg BP, Steijns JA, Munneke M, Kremer BP, Bloem BR | title = Falls in degenerative cerebellar ataxias | journal = Mov.

* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|cerebrocerebellum]]''' (lateral hemispheres) presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities (called appendicular ataxia).&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenfeld&quot; /&gt; These include:
**[[intention tremor]] (coarse trembling, accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements, possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso);
**peculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining);
**a peculiar pattern of [[dysarthria]] (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm).
**inability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as [[dysdiadochokinesia]]. This could involve rapidly switching from [[pronation]] to [[supination]] of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Examination of Coordination |vauthors=Schmitz TJ, O'Sullivan SB | title = Physical rehabilitation | publisher = F.A. Davis | location = Philadelphia | year = 2007 | pages = 193–225 | isbn = 978-0-8036-1247-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**inability to judge distances or ranges of movement. This is known as [[dysmetria]] and is often seen as undershooting, [[hypometria]], or overshooting, [[hypermetria]], the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone's finger or touch his or her own nose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot; /&gt;
**the rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia. For example, when a patient is flexing his or her elbow isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patient's arm may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patient will check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot; /&gt;
**patients may exhibit a constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are gathered under the terminology of [[Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome|Schmahmann's syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Mariën P | title = Schmahmann's syndrome - identification of the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology | journal = Cerebellum &amp; Ataxias | volume = 2 | pages = 2 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26331045 | pmc = 4552302 | doi = 10.1186/s40673-015-0023-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory ===
The term [[sensory ataxia]] is employed to indicate ataxia due to loss of [[proprioception]], the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.

Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady &quot;stomping&quot; gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.

[[Physician]]s can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to &quot;fall down&quot; and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the &quot;ataxic hand&quot;).

=== Vestibular ===
The term ''vestibular ataxia'' is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.

== Causes ==
The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging.

=== Focal lesions ===
Any type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], [[multiple sclerosis]], inflammatory [such as [[sarcoidosis]]], and “chronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome” [CLIPPERS&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jbsr.be/articles/10.5334/jbr-btr.997/&lt;/ref&gt;]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).

=== Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) ===
Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]] (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[synthetic cannabinoid]] [[Dexanabinol|HU-211]] ingestion&lt;ref name=&quot;Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title=Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211253/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various other recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses). A further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia, especially in high doses, are [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid817697&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Browne TR | title = Clonazepam.

=== Radiation poisoning ===
Ataxia can be induced as a result of severe [[Acute radiation syndrome|acute radiation poisoning]] with an absorbed dose of more than 30 [[Gray (unit)|grays]].

=== Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency ===
[[Vitamin B12 deficiency|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency]] may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia.

=== Hereditary ataxias ===
Ataxia may depend on [[hereditary]] disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and/or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include [[autosomal dominant]] ones such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]], [[episodic ataxia]], and [[dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy]], as well as [[autosomal recessive]] disorders such as [[Friedreich's ataxia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and [[Niemann Pick disease]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and [[abetalipoproteinaemia]]. An example of X-linked ataxic condition is the rare [[fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome]] or FXTAS.

=== Arnold–Chiari malformation (congenital ataxia) ===
[[Arnold–Chiari malformation]] is a malformation of the [[Human brain|brain]]. It consists of a downward displacement of the [[cerebellar tonsils]] and the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] through the [[foramen magnum]], sometimes causing [[hydrocephalus]] as a result of obstruction of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] outflow.

=== Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ===
[[Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency]] is an [[autosomal]]-[[recessive gene]] disorder where mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene results in the accumulation of [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB) in the body. GHB accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other [[neurological]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlSSADH &quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Disorders of GABA metabolism | last= Pearl | first=P.  | pmc=4256671 | pmid=25485164 | doi=10.3233/PEP-14097 | volume=3 | issue= 4 | year=2014 | pages=217–227 | journal=Journal of Pediatric Epilepsy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sodium-potassium pump ===
Malfunction of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] may be a factor in some ataxias. The {{chem|Na|+}}-{{chem|K|+}} pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of [[cerebellar]] [[Purkinje neurons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forrest MD, Wall MJ, Press DA, Feng J | title = The Sodium-Potassium Pump Controls the Intrinsic Firing of the Cerebellar Purkinje Neuron | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = e51169 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23284664 | pmc = 3527461 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0051169 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...751169F }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, &quot;housekeeping&quot; molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computational element in the [[cerebellum]] and the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=The sodium-potassium pump is an information processing element in brain computation |journal=Frontiers in Physiology |volume=5 |issue=472 |pages=472 |date=December 2014 |doi=10.3389/fphys.2014.00472 |pmid=25566080 |doi-access=free|pmc=4274886 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, an [[ouabain]] block of {{chem|Na|+}}-{{chem|K|+}} pumps in the cerebellum of a live [[mouse]] results in it displaying ataxia and [[dystonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calderon DP, Fremont R, Kraenzlin F, Khodakhah K | title = The neural substrates of rapid-onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–365 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21297628 | pmc = 3430603 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations.

=== Cerebellar ataxia associated with anti-GAD antibodies ===
Antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD: enzyme changing glutamate into GABA) cause cerebellar deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitoma H, Manto M, Hampe CS | title = Pathogenic Roles of Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65 Autoantibodies in Cerebellar Ataxias | journal = Journal of Immunology Research | volume = 2017 | pages = 2913297 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28386570 | pmc = 5366212 | doi = 10.1155/2017/2913297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Honnorat J, Hampe CS, Guerra-Narbona R, López-Ramos JC, Delgado-García JM, Saitow F, Suzuki H, Yanagawa Y, Mizusawa H, Mitoma H | title = Disease-specific monoclonal antibodies targeting glutamate decarboxylase impair GABAergic neurotransmission and affect motor learning and behavioral functions | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 9 | pages = 78 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25870548 | pmc = 4375997 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely. Recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury (such as [[stroke]] or a [[benign tumour]]), compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;can rehabilitation help&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton SM, Bastian AJ | title = Can rehabilitation help ataxia? | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 22 | pages = 1818–1819 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19864635 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c33b21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;systematic review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trujillo-Martín MM, Serrano-Aguilar P, Monton-Alvarez F, Carrillo-Fumero R | title = Effectiveness and safety of treatments for degenerative ataxias: a systematic review | journal = Mov. Disord. | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1111–1124 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19412936 | doi = 10.1002/mds.22564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of rare conditions presenting with prominent cerebellar ataxia are amenable to specific treatment and recognition of these disorders is critical. Diseases include vitamin E deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann–Pick type C disease, Refsum's disease, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency, episodic ataxia type 2, gluten ataxia, glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramirez-Zamora A, Zeigler W, Desai N, Biller J|title=Treatable causes of cerebellar ataxia | journal = Movement Disorders | date = Mar 2015 | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26158 |pmid=25757427 | pages=614–623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]] to reduce [[disability]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17000340&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perlman SL | title = Ataxias | journal = Clin. Geriatr. Med. | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 859–877, vii | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17000340 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2006.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include: [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP), [[idebenone]], [[amantadine]], [[physostigmine]], [[L-carnitine]] or derivatives, [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]], [[vigabatrin]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], [[acetazolamide]], [[4-aminopyridine]], [[buspirone]], and a combination of [[coenzyme Q10]] and [[vitamin E]].&lt;ref name=&quot;systematic review&quot;/&gt;

[[Physical therapy]] requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating [[motor learning]] for retraining specific functional motor patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilg W, Synofzik M, Brötz D, Burkard S, Giese MA, Schöls L | title = Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 22 | pages = 1823–1830 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19864636 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c33adf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective, but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19114434&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin CL, Tan D, Bragge P, Bialocerkowski A | title = Effectiveness of physiotherapy for adults with cerebellar dysfunction: a systematic review | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–26 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19114434 | doi = 10.1177/0269215508097853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation, [[Frenkel exercises]], [[proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation]] (PNF), and balance training; however, therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy.

Current research suggests that, if a person is able to walk with or without a [[mobility aid]], physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components: static balance, dynamic balance, trunk-limb coordination, stairs, and [[contracture]] prevention. Once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently, it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes. These outcomes include balance tasks, gait, and individual activities of daily living. While the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip and/or ankle joints, it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease&quot;/&gt;

Decomposition, simplification, or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9184691&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastian AJ | title = Mechanisms of ataxia | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 672–675 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9184691 | doi = 10.1093/ptj/77.6.672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Training likely needs to be intense and focused—as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining.&lt;ref name=&quot;stroke ataxia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards L, Senesac C, McGuirk T, Woodbury M, Howland D, Davis S, Patterson T | title = Response to intensive upper extremity therapy by individuals with ataxia from stroke | journal = Top Stroke Rehabil | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 262–271 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18647730 | doi = 10.1310/tsr1503-262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their therapy consisted of [[constraint-induced movement therapy]] which resulted in improvements of their arm function.&lt;ref name=&quot;stroke ataxia&quot; /&gt; Treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of [[Balance (ability)|balance]] or poor [[Motor coordination|coordination]]. Severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a [[wheelchair]]. To obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia. For example, muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns.

There are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia. The [[International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale]] (ICARS) is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitz-Hübsch T, Tezenas du Montcel S, Baliko L, Boesch S, Bonato S, Fancellu R, Giunti P, Globas C, Kang JS, Kremer B, Mariotti C, Melegh B, Rakowicz M, Rola R, Romano S, Schöls L, Szymanski S, van de Warrenburg BP, Zdzienicka E, Dürr A, Klockgether T | title = Reliability and validity of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale: a study in 156 spinocerebellar ataxia patients | journal = Mov.

These tests include, but are not limited to:
* The [[Berg Balance Scale]]
* Tandem Walking (to test for [[Tandem gait]]ability)
* Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) &lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16769946&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitz-Hübsch T, du Montcel ST, Baliko L, Berciano J, Boesch S, Depondt C, Giunti P, Globas C, Infante J, Kang JS, Kremer B, Mariotti C, Melegh B, Pandolfo M, Rakowicz M, Ribai P, Rola R, Schöls L, Szymanski S, van de Warrenburg BP, Dürr A, Klockgether T, Fancellu R | title = Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia: development of a new clinical scale | journal = Neurology | volume = 66 | issue = 11 | pages = 1717–1720 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16769946 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000219042.60538.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;ataxia&quot; is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include '''optic ataxia''' (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and '''ataxic respiration''' (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the [[medulla oblongata]]). Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention. Optic ataxia is usually part of [[Balint's syndrome]], but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17603404&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallar G | title = Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 527–536 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17603404 | doi =  10.1017/S1092852900021271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
