'''Alan Alexander Milne''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|l|n}}; 18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was an English author, best known for his books about the [[teddy bear]] [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and for various poems. Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars, joining the British Army in World War I, and was a captain of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British Home Guard]] in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/A-A-Milne|title=A.A.

==Biography==
Alan Alexander Milne was born in [[Kilburn, London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35031?docPos=2|title=&quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to parents John Vine Milne, who was born in Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherborne|first=Michael|title=H.G.

G. Wells]], who taught there in 1889–90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22657 | year = 1989 | title = Hampstead: Education | journal=A History of the County of Middlesex | volume = 9 | pages = 159–169 | accessdate = 9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milne attended [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MLN900AA|name=Milne, Alan Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied on a mathematics scholarship, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Mathematics in 1903.  He edited and wrote for ''[[Granta]]'', a student magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNBthwaite&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thwaite|first=Ann|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=January 2008|chapter=Milne, Alan Alexander (1882–1956)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor. Considered a talented [[cricket]] fielder, Milne played for two amateur teams that were largely composed of British writers: the [[Allahakbarries]] and the [[Authors Cricket Club|Authors XI]]. His teammates included fellow writers [[J. M. Barrie]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8662375.stm &quot;What is the connection between Peter Pan, Sherlock Holmes, Winnie the Pooh and the noble sport of cricket?]. BBC.

Milne joined the British Army in [[World War I]] and served as an officer in the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] and later, after a debilitating illness, the [[Royal Corps of Signals]]. He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 1 February 1915 as a [[second lieutenant]] (on probation).&lt;ref name=&quot;LG 16 February 1915&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29070 |date=16 February 1915 |page=1563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His commission was confirmed on 20 December 1915.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette. issue 29408 17 December 1915. Retrieved 26 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 1916, he was injured while serving in the [[Battle of the Somme]] and invalided back to England. Having recuperated, he was recruited into Military Intelligence to write propaganda articles for [[MI7|MI7 (b)]] between 1916 and 1918. He was discharged on 14 February 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finch| first = Christopher| title = Disney's Winnie the Pooh: A Celebration of the Silly Old Bear| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aJt8beaKgb8C&amp;pg=PA18| year = 2000| publisher = Disney Editions| isbn = 978-0-7868-6352-5| page = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in Mallord Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For sale: Winnie-the-Pooh creator A&amp;nbsp;A Milne's home |date=27 March 2013 |author= Davidson, Max |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buyingsellingandmoving/9957606/For-sale-Winnie-the-Pooh-creator-A-A-Milnes-home.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relinquished his commission on 19 February 1920, retaining the rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31786 |supp=y|page=2036|date=17 February 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled ''Peace with Honour'' (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's ''War with Honour''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNBthwaite&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capitalization as in the [[British Library]] Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow English writer (and Authors XI cricket teammate) P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g., in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'') by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne &quot;was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theparisreview.com/media/3773_WODEHOUSE.pdf |title=The Art of Fiction – P.G.

Milne married Dorothy &quot;Daphne&quot; de Sélincourt in 1913 and their son [[Christopher Robin Milne]] was born in 1920.  In 1925, Milne bought a country home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], East Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520#|title=Cotchford Farm|work=National Monument Records|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=29 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012054412/http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520|archivedate=12 October 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Milne was Captain of the [[British Home Guard]] in Hartfield &amp; Forest Row, insisting on being plain &quot;Mr. Milne&quot; to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid, and by August 1953 &quot;he seemed very old and disenchanted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Letter La Z 5 July 1917 – John Middleton Murry to Beatrice Elvery |date=12 August 1953 |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/lss/services/mss/collections/online-mss-catalogues/cats/laz4-5cat.html#laz57 |publisher=George Lazarus Collection |accessdate=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.&lt;ref&gt;Jill C.

==Literary career==

===1903 to 1925===
[[File:A a milne.jpg|thumb|left|A. A. Milne in 1922]]
After graduating from Cambridge University in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to ''Punch'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Milne | first = A. A. |date=August 1904 | title = Lillian's Loves | journal=[[Punch (magazine)|Punch, or the London Charivari]] | volume = 127 | issue = 24 August 1904 | page = 142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Milne | first = A.

A.

During this period he published 18 plays and three novels, including the murder mystery ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (1922). His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children's poems, ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'', which were illustrated by ''Punch'' staff cartoonist [[E. H. Shepard]].  A collection of short stories for children ''[[A Gallery of Children]]'', and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.

Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]]). These were ''The Bump'', starring [[C. Aubrey Smith|Aubrey Smith]]; ''Twice Two''; ''Five Pound Reward''; and ''Bookworms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Eforgan| first = E.| title = Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor| year = 2010| isbn = 978-0-85303-971-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these films survive in the archives of the [[British Film Institute]]. Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milne's play ''Mr Pim Passes By'' in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Thomas Burnett Swann| title = A. A. Milne| url = https://archive.org/details/aamilnesawn00swan| url-access = registration| year = 1971| publisher = Twayne Publishers| page = [https://archive.org/details/aamilnesawn00swan/page/41 41] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back on this period (in 1926), Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a &quot;''Punch'' humorist&quot; was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that &quot;the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory ''con amore'' as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RedHouseMystery_Intro&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Milne |first=Alan Alexander |title=[[The Red House Mystery]] |origyear=1922 |year=1926 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |location=London  |pages=ix–xii |chapter=Introduction (dated April 1926)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1926 to 1928===

Milne is most famous for his two ''Pooh'' books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]] after his son, [[Christopher Robin Milne]] (1920&amp;ndash;1996), and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie-the-Pooh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/winnie-the-pooh-exploring-a-classic|title=V&amp;A · Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed bear, originally named &quot;Edward,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nypl.org/locations/tid/36/node/5557|title=The Adventures of the REAL Winnie-the-Pooh|website=The New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; was renamed &quot;Winnie&quot; after a Canadian [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named [[Winnipeg (bear)|Winnie]] (after [[Winnipeg]]), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to [[London Zoo]] during the war. &quot;The pooh&quot; comes from a swan the young Milne named &quot;Pooh.&quot; [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy, Growler (&quot;a magnificent bear&quot;), as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys, [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], [[Eeyore]], Kanga, Roo and [[Tigger]], were incorporated into A. A. Milne's stories,&lt;ref name=&quot;Express&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;birthday&quot;/&gt; and two more characters&amp;nbsp;– Rabbit and Owl&amp;nbsp;– were created by Milne's imagination. Christopher Robin Milne's own toys are now on display in New York where 750,000 people visit them every year.

The fictional [[Hundred Acre Wood]] of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in [[Ashdown Forest]] in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cotchford Farm, {{Coord|  51.090|   0.107|display=inline}}, and took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: &quot;Pooh's Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Express&quot;/&gt; Popular tourist locations at Ashdown Forest include: ''Galleon's Lap'', ''The Enchanted Place'', the ''[[Heffalump trap|Heffalump Trap]]'' and ''Lone Pine'', ''Eeyore’s Sad and Gloomy Place'', and the wooden ''Pooh Bridge'' where Pooh and Piglet invented [[Poohsticks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-11380115 Plans to improve access to Pooh Bridge unveiled]. BBC. Retrieved 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Not yet known as Pooh, he made his first appearance in a poem, &quot;Teddy Bear,&quot; published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in February 1924 and republished in ''[[When We Were Very Young]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrate Winnie-The-Pooh's 90th With A Rare Recording (And Hunny)|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/22/280761847/celebrating-winnie-the-poohs-90th-with-a-rare-recording-and-some-hunny|publisher=NPR|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pooh first appeared in the ''[[London Evening News]]'' on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called &quot;The Wrong Sort Of Bees.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;birthday&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4552940.stm &quot;Pooh celebrates his 80th birthday&quot;].

A second collection of nursery rhymes, ''[[Now We Are Six]]'', was published in 1927. All four books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also &quot;gallantly stepped forward&quot; to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse's ''A Damsel in Distress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9L2kjKQ8CvYC&amp;pg=PA114|title=P.G.

===1929 onwards===
The success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war ''Punch'' from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[J. M. Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (although this was severely criticised by [[Raymond Chandler]] for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, &quot;said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words&quot; (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

Another reason Milne stopped writing children's books, and especially about Winnie-the-Pooh, was that he felt &quot;amazement and disgust&quot; over the fame his son was exposed to, and said that &quot;I feel that the legal Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him. I do not want CR Milne to ever wish that his name were Charles Robert.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160128-a-a-milne-and-the-curse-of-pooh-bear BBC - Culture - AA Milne and the curse of Pooh bear]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his literary home, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem &quot;The Norman Church&quot; and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hedblad (1998). &quot;Something about the Author, Volume 100.&quot; p. 177. Gale,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Milne adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jill C. Wheeler (2010). &quot;A. A. Milne.&quot; p. 19. ABDO Publishing Company,&lt;/ref&gt; The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,&quot; could not survive translation to the theatre.

Copyright Office, Library of Congress, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

Milne and his wife became estranged from their son, who came to resent what he saw as his father's exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Enchanted Places|url=https://archive.org/details/enchantedplaces00miln|url-access=registration|last=Milne|first=Christopher|publisher=Eyre Methuen|year=1974|isbn=978-0-14-003449-3|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher's marriage to his first cousin, Lesley de Sélincourt, distanced him still further from his parents – Lesley's father and Christopher's mother had not spoken to each other for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/i-knew-christopher-robin--the-real-christopher-robin/|title=The real Christopher Robin|last=Brandreth|first=Giles|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/23/how-aa-milne-and-christopher-robin-fell-under-the-curse-of-pooh-bear|title=AA Milne, Christopher Robin and the curse of Winnie-the-Pooh|last=Boyce|first=Frank Cottrell|date=2017-09-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British Home Guard]]:  &quot;In fighting Hitler,&quot; he wrote, &quot;we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ...

His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:
{{quote|The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief—call it what you will—than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Simpson| first = James B.| title = Simpson's Contemporary Quotations| url = http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/4393.html| year = 1988| publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]]| location = Boston, Massachusetts| isbn = 0-395-43085-2| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122122546/http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/4393.html| archivedate = 22 January 2009| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He wrote in the poem &quot;Explained&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Elizabeth Ann
Said to her Nan:
&quot;Please will you tell me how God began?
''Somebody'' must have made Him. So
Who could it be, 'cos I want to know?&quot;

He also wrote in the poem &quot;Vespers&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Oh! Thank you, God, for a lovely day.
And what was the other I had to say?
I said &quot;Bless Daddy,&quot; so what can it be?
Oh! Now I remember it. God bless Me.&quot;
