[[File:040719 172 dorset marnhull2.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|Modern mechanised agriculture permits large [[field (agriculture)|fields]] like this one in [[Dorset]], England]]
'''Arable land''' ({{lang-la|[[wikt:arabilis#Latin|arabilis]]}}, &quot;able to be [[plow]]ed&quot;) is any land capable of being [[plough]]ed and used to grow [[crop]]s.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} &quot;arable, ''adj''. and ''n.''&quot; Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, for the purposes of [[agriculture|agricultural]] statistics,&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Agricultural land (% of land area) http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517075041/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS |date=17 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term often has a more precise definition: &quot;Arable land is the land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or [[pasture]], land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily [[fallow]] (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for 'Arable land' are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;FAOSTAT. [Statistical database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] Glossary. http://faostat3.fao.org/mes/glossary/E {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601235945/http://faostat3.fao.org/mes/glossary/E |date=1 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more concise definition appearing in the Eurostat glossary similarly refers to actual rather than potential uses: &quot;land worked (ploughed or tilled) regularly, generally under a system of [[crop rotation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat. Glossary: Arable land. http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Arable_land {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507063241/http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Arable_land |date=7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-arable land can sometimes be converted to arable land through methods such as loosening and [[tillage|tilling]] (breaking up) of the [[soil]], though in more extreme cases the degree of modification required to make certain types of land arable can be prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultivation Cultivation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420014617/https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultivation |date=20 April 2018 }}. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, arable land has traditionally been contrasted with [[pasturable]] land such as [[heath]]s, which could be used for [[sheep-rearing]] but not as [[farmland]].

==Non-arable land==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Water buffalo ploughing rice fields near Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia]]
[[File:Beverley Minster from West Pasture.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A pasture in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] in [[England]]]]
[[Agricultural land]] that is not arable according to the FAO definition above includes:
* [[Permanent crop]] – land that produces crops from woody vegetation, e.g. orchardland, vineyards, coffee plantations, rubber plantations, and land producing nut trees;
* Meadows and [[pasture]]s – land used as pasture and grazed range, and those natural grasslands and sedge meadows that are used for hay production in some regions.

Other non-arable land includes land that is not suitable for any agricultural use. Land that is not arable, in the sense of lacking capability or suitability for cultivation for crop production, has one or more limitations – a lack of sufficient fresh water for irrigation, stoniness, steepness, adverse climate, excessive wetness with impracticality of drainage, and/or excessive salts, among others.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service.  1961.  Land capability classification.  Agriculture Handbook 210.  21 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Although such limitations may preclude cultivation, and some will in some cases preclude any agricultural use, large areas unsuitable for cultivation may still be agriculturally productive. For example, US NRCS statistics indicate that about 59 percent of US non-federal pasture and unforested rangeland is unsuitable for cultivation, yet such land has value for grazing of [[livestock]].&lt;ref&gt;NRCS.  2013.   Summary report 2010 national resources inventory.   United States Natural Resources Conservation Service.   163 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In British Columbia, Canada, 41 percent of the provincial Agricultural Land Reserve area is unsuitable for production of cultivated crops, but is suitable for uncultivated production of forage usable by grazing livestock.&lt;ref name=ALCALRFS&gt;Agricultural Land Commission.  Agriculture Capability and the ALR Fact Sheet. http://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alc/DownloadAsset?assetId=72876D8604EC45279B8D3C1B14428CF8&amp;filename=agriculture_capability__the_alr_fact_sheet_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Similar examples can be found in many [[rangeland]] areas elsewhere.

Land incapable of being cultivated for production of crops can sometimes be converted to arable land. New arable land makes more food, and can reduce [[starvation]]. This outcome also makes a country more [[self-sufficient]] and politically independent, because food importation is reduced. Making non-arable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells, aqueducts, [[desalination]] plants, planting trees for shade in the desert, [[hydroponic]]s, fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, [[pesticide]]s, [[reverse osmosis]] water processors, [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] insulation or other insulation against heat and cold, digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind, and installing greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas. Such modifications are often prohibitively expensive. An alternative is the [[seawater greenhouse]], which desalinates water through evaporation and condensation using solar energy as the only energy input. This technology is optimized to grow crops on desert land close to the sea.

(Note: The use of artifices does not make land arable. Rock still remains rock, and shallow less than 6 feet turnable soil is still not considered toilable. The use of artifice is an open-air none recycled water hydroponics relationship.{{clarify |date=November 2019 |reason=Unclear what this sentence means}} The below described circumstances are not in perspective, have limited duration, and have a tendency to accumulate trace materials in soil that either there or elsewhere cause deoxygenation. The use of vast amounts of fertilizer may have unintended consequences for the environment by devastating rivers, waterways, and river endings through the accumulation of non-degradable toxins and nitrogen-bearing molecules that remove oxygen and cause non-aerobic processes to form.)

Examples of infertile non-arable land being turned into fertile arable land include:
* [[Aran Islands]]: These islands off the west coast of Ireland, (not to be confused with the [[Isle of Arran]] in Scotland's [[Firth of Clyde]]), were unsuitable for arable farming because they were too rocky. The people covered the islands with a shallow layer of seaweed and sand from the ocean. Today, crops are grown there, even though the islands are still considered non-arable.
* Israel: The construction of [[desalination]] plants along Israel's coast allowed agriculture in some areas that were formerly desert. The desalination plants, which remove the salt from ocean water, have created a new source of water for farming, drinking, and washing.
* [[Slash and burn]] agriculture uses nutrients in wood ash, but these expire within a few years.
* [[Terra preta]], fertile tropical soils created by adding charcoal.

Examples of fertile arable land being turned into infertile land include:
* Droughts such as the &quot;[[Dust Bowl]]&quot; of the [[Great Depression]] in the U.S. turned farmland into desert.
* [[Rainforest]] deforestation: The fertile tropical forests are converted into infertile desert land. For example, Madagascar's central highland plateau has become virtually totally barren (about ten percent of the country) as a result of [[slash-and-burn]] [[illegal logging in Madagascar|deforestation]], an element of [[shifting cultivation]] practiced by many natives.
* Each year, arable land is lost due to [[desertification]] and human-induced [[erosion]]. Improper irrigation of farm land can wick the [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] from the soil and water to the surface. This process steadily concentrates salt in the root zone, decreasing productivity for crops that are not salt-tolerant.
