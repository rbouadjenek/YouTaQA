{{Infobox astatine}}
'''Astatine''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''At''' and [[atomic number]] 85. It is the rarest [[naturally occurring element]] in the [[Earth's crust]], occurring only as the [[Decay chain|decay product]] of various heavier elements. All of astatine's [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.

The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty. Many of them have been estimated based on the element's position on the [[periodic table]] as a heavier analog of [[iodine]], and a member of the [[halogen]]s (the group of elements including [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a [[semiconductor]] or possibly a [[metal]]; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several [[anion]]ic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable [[monatomic cation]] in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).

The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio G. Segrè]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who named it from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''astatos'' (ἄστατος), meaning &quot;unstable&quot;. Four [[isotopes of astatine]] were subsequently found to be naturally occurring, although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth's crust. Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210, nor the medically useful astatine-211, occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding [[bismuth]]-209 with [[alpha particle]]s.

== Characteristics ==
Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have short [[half-life|half-lives]] of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, [[bismuth]], [[polonium]] or [[radon]]. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only [[francium]] is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot;&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electron affinity]] of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of [[spin–orbit interaction]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Champion&quot;/&gt;

In 1869, when [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published his [[Periodic table#Mendeleev's table|periodic table]], the space under iodine was empty; after [[Niels Bohr]] established the physical basis of the classification of chemical elements, it was suggested that the fifth halogen belonged there. Before its officially recognized discovery, it was called &quot;eka-iodine&quot; (from [[Sanskrit]] ''eka''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;one&quot;) to imply it was one space under iodine (in the same manner as [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka-silicon, eka-boron, and others]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=P.|title=The Ingredients: A Guided Tour of the Elements|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|pages=100–102 | isbn = 978-0-19-284100-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists tried to find it in nature; given its extreme rarity, these attempts resulted in several false discoveries.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=227–228}}

In 1936, the team of Romanian physicist [[Horia Hulubei]] and French physicist [[Yvette Cauchois]] claimed to have discovered element 85 via X-ray analysis. In 1939, they published another paper which supported and extended previous data. In 1944, Hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time, claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers. He chose the name &quot;dor&quot;, presumably from the Romanian for &quot;longing&quot; [for peace], as [[World War II]] had started five years earlier. As Hulubei was writing in French, a language which does not accommodate the &quot;ine&quot; suffix, dor would likely have been rendered in English as &quot;dorine&quot;, had it been adopted. In 1947, Hulubei's claim was effectively rejected by the Austrian chemist [[Friedrich Paneth]], who would later chair the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] committee responsible for recognition of new elements. Even though Hulubei's samples did contain astatine, his means to detect it were too weak, by current standards, to enable correct identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Finding Eka-Iodine: Discovery Priority in Modern Times|first1=S.

Later in 1940, [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segrè]] isolated the element at the University of California, Berkeley. Instead of searching for the element in nature, the scientists created it by bombarding [[bismuth-209]] with [[alpha particle]]s in a [[cyclotron]] (particle accelerator) to produce, after emission of two neutrons, astatine-211.{{sfn|Corson|MacKenzie|Segrè|1940}} The discoverers, however, did not immediately suggest a name for the element. The reason for this was that at the time, an element created synthetically in &quot;invisible quantities&quot; that had not yet discovered in nature was not seen as a completely valid one; in addition, chemists were reluctant to recognize radioactive isotopes as legitimately as stable ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/pardir/Book%20Reviews/The_Chemical_Elements.pdf|title=The Chemical Elements|last=Davis|first=Helen Miles|publisher=[[Science Service]], [[Ballantine Books]]|year=1959|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=|pages=29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, astatine was found as a product of two naturally occurring [[decay chain]]s by [[Berta Karlik]] and Traude Bernert, first in the so-called [[Decay chain#Uranium series|uranium series]], and then in the [[Decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | language = German | title = Eine Neue Natürliche α-Strahlung | trans-title = A New Natural α-radiation | last1 = Karlik | first1 = B.| pages = 298–299 | volume = 31 | issue = 25–26 | year = 1943 | journal = Naturwissenschaften | doi = 10.1007/BF01475613 | last2 = Bernert | first2 = T.|bibcode = 1943NW.....31..298K }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | language = German | title = Das Element 85 in den Natürlichen Zerfallsreihen | trans-title = The Element 85 in the Natural Decay Chains |journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 123 | issue = 1–2 | year = 1943 | doi = 10.1007/BF01375144 | pages = 51–72 | last = Karlik | first = B.| last2 = Bernert | first2 = T.|bibcode = 1944ZPhy..123...51K }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Since then, astatine was also found in a third decay chain, the [[Decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=C.

In early 1947, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published the discoverers' suggestions; a letter from Corson, MacKenzie, and Segrè suggested the name &quot;astatine&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; coming from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''astatos'' (αστατος) meaning &quot;unstable&quot;, because of its propensity for [[radioactive decay]], with the ending &quot;-ine&quot;, found in the names of the four previously discovered halogens.

Astatine's [[alpha decay]] energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} Lighter astatine isotopes have quite [[Alpha particle#Energy and absorption|high energies]] of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1&amp;nbsp;hours for astatine-210 and 7.2&amp;nbsp;hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot; /&gt;{{efn|This means that, if decay modes other than alpha are omitted, then astatine-210 has an alpha decay half-life of 4,628.6&amp;nbsp;hours (128.9&amp;nbsp;days) and astatine-211 has one of only 17.2 hours (0.7&amp;nbsp;days). Therefore, astatine-211 is very much less stable toward alpha decay than the previous isotope.}} The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of [[beta decay]] (electron emission).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isotope Geology|edition=2nd|publisher=Pergamon Press|page=403|year=1956 | isbn = 978-0-470-70800-2 |first=K.|last=Rankama}}&lt;/ref&gt; though nuclear mass measurements reveal that &lt;sup&gt;215&lt;/sup&gt;At is in fact [[beta-stable]], as it has the lowest mass of all [[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]] with ''A'' = 215.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot; /&gt; A beta decay mode has been found for all other astatine isotopes except for astatine-213, astatine-214, and astatine-216m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot; /&gt; Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay ([[positron emission]]), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes [[electron capture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot; /&gt;

The most stable isotope is astatine-210, which has a half-life of 8.1&amp;nbsp;hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter [[polonium-210]]. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived [[bismuth-209]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot; /&gt;

Astatine has 24 known [[nuclear isomer]]s, which are nuclei with one or more [[nucleon]]s ([[proton]]s or [[neutron]]s) in an [[excited state]]. A nuclear isomer may also be called a &quot;[[metastability|meta]]-state&quot;, meaning the system has more [[internal energy]] than the &quot;[[ground state]]&quot; (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter. There may be more than one isomer for each isotope. The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine-202m1,{{efn|&quot;m1&quot; means that this state of the isotope is the next possible one above&amp;nbsp;– with an energy greater than&amp;nbsp;– the ground state. &quot;m2&quot; and similar designations refer to further higher energy states. The number may be dropped if there is only one well-established meta state, such as astatine-216m. Other designation techniques are sometimes used.}} which has a half-life of about 3 minutes, longer than those of all the ground states bar those of isotopes 203–211 and 220. The least stable is astatine-214m1; its half-life of 265 [[nanosecond]]s is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine-213.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fry&quot; /&gt;

The landmass of North and South America combined, to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; grams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1RMLAAAAMAAJ | title = Only a Trillion| first = I.| last = Asimov | authorlink = Isaac Asimov | publisher = Abelard-Schuman | year = 1957 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237.

Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6&amp;nbsp;[[giga-|giga]] [[becquerel]]s{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}} (about 86&amp;nbsp;[[nanogram]]s or 2.47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; atoms).

The most important isotope is astatine-211, the only one in commercial use. To produce the bismuth target, the metal is [[sputtering|sputtered]] onto a gold, copper, or aluminium surface at 50 to 100 milligrams per square centimeter. [[Bismuth oxide]] can be used instead; this is forcibly fused with a copper plate.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} The target is kept under a [[Nitrogen gas#Reactions|chemically neutral nitrogen]] atmosphere,&lt;ref name=&quot;BiN2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic Chemistry for Undergraduates|first=R. |last=Gopalan |year=2009|page=547|publisher=Universities Press | isbn = 978-81-7371-660-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fs4zQ-hNTz8C&amp;lpg=PA492}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is cooled with water to prevent premature astatine vaporization.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} In a particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Targeted Radionuclide Tumor Therapy: Biological Aspects|first1=T.|last1=Stigbrand |first2=J. |last2=Carlsson |first3=G.

Even though only one bismuth isotope is used (bismuth-209), the reaction may occur in three possible ways, producing astatine-209, astatine-210, or astatine-211. In order to eliminate undesired nuclides, the maximum energy of the particle accelerator is set to a value (optimally 29.17&amp;nbsp;MeV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G.|last1=Gyehong |first2=K.|last2=Chun|first3=S.

=== Separation methods ===
Since astatine is the main product of the synthesis, after its formation it must only be separated from the target and any significant contaminants. Several methods are available, &quot;but they generally follow one of two approaches—dry distillation or [wet] acid treatment of the target followed by solvent extraction.&quot; The methods summarized below are modern adaptations of older procedures, as reviewed by Kugler and Keller.{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|pp=95–106, 133–139}}{{efn|See also Lavrukhina and Pozdnyakov.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=243–253}}}} Pre-1985 techniques more often addressed the elimination of co-produced toxic polonium; this requirement is now mitigated by capping the energy of the cyclotron irradiation beam.{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}}

==== Dry ====
The astatine-containing cyclotron target is heated to a temperature of around 650&amp;nbsp;°C. The astatine [[Volatilization|volatilizes]] and is condensed in (typically) a [[cold trap]]. Higher temperatures of up to around 850&amp;nbsp;°C may increase the yield, at the risk of bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization. Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|p=97}} (as bismuth can interfere with astatine [[radioactive tracer|labeling reactions]]). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as [[sodium hydroxide]], [[methanol]] or [[chloroform]]. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=R. H.|last2=Wieland|first2=B.

==== Wet ====
The irradiated bismuth (or sometimes [[bismuth trioxide]]) target is first dissolved in, for example, concentrated nitric or perchloric acid. Following this first step, the acid can be distilled away to leave behind a white residue that contains both bismuth and the desired astatine product. This residue is then dissolved in a concentrated acid, such as hydrochloric acid. Astatine is extracted from this acid using an organic solvent such as [[dibutyl ether|butyl]] or [[isopropyl ether]], diisopropylether (DIPE), or [[thiosemicarbazide]]. Using liquid-liquid extraction, the astatine product can be repeatedly washed with an acid, such as HCl, and extracted into the organic solvent layer. A separation yield of 93% using nitric acid has been reported, falling to 72% by the time purification procedures were completed (distillation of nitric acid, purging residual [[nitrogen oxide]]s, and redissolving [[bismuth nitrate]] to enable [[liquid–liquid extraction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yordanov|first1=A.

Newly formed astatine-211 is the subject of ongoing research in [[nuclear medicine]].{{sfn|Vértes|Nagy|Klencsár|2003|p=337}} It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2&amp;nbsp;hours; this is long enough to permit [[radioactive tracer|multistep labeling strategies]]. Astatine-211 has potential for [[targeted alpha-particle therapy]], since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalutsky|first1=Michael|last2=Vaidyanathan|first2=Ganesan|title=Astatine-211-Labeled Radiotherapeutics An Emerging Approach to Targeted Alpha-Particle Radiotherapy|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=1 September 2000|volume=6|issue=14|pages=1433–1455|doi=10.2174/1381612003399275|pmid=10903402}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay), very quickly reaching its stable granddaughter lead-207. Polonium X-rays emitted as a result of the electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]], enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients.{{sfn|Vértes|Nagy|Klencsár|2003|p=337}} Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilbur |first=D. Scott |date=20 February 2013 |title=Enigmatic astatine |journal=Nature Chemistry |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=246 |doi=10.1038/nchem.1580 |pmid=23422568 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2013NatCh...5..246W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal medicinal difference between astatine-211 and [[iodine-131]] (a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high-energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70&amp;nbsp;µm through surrounding tissues; an average-energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2&amp;nbsp;mm.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} The short half-life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the &quot;tumor burden is low and/or malignant cell populations are located in close proximity to essential normal tissues.&quot;{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}} Significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine-211 atoms bound per cell.{{sfn|Vértes|Nagy|Klencsár|2003|p=338}}

Several obstacles have been encountered in the development of astatine-based [[radiopharmaceuticals]] for [[cancer]] treatment. [[World War II]] delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the 1970s that [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to [[dehalogenation|dehalogenate]] from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon sites]]{{efn|In other words, where carbon's one s [[atomic orbital]] and three p orbitals [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridize]] to give four new orbitals shaped as intermediates between the original s and p orbitals.}} (less so from [[Orbital hybridisation#sp2|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sites]]). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a &quot;staggering&quot; number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilbur&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Vaidyanathan |first2=M.

Animal studies show that astatine, similarly to iodine&amp;nbsp;– although to a lesser extent, perhaps because of its slightly more metallic nature&lt;ref name=Stwertka&gt;Stwertka, Albert. ''A Guide to the Elements'', Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 193. {{ISBN|0-19-508083-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;– is preferentially (and dangerously) concentrated in the [[thyroid gland]]. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows a tendency to be taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; to At&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Guerard /&gt; If administered in the form of a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the [[liver]]. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell [[dysplasia]] within the gland.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=232–233}} Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Odell |first1= T.
