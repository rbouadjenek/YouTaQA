Vol. 1. p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1920 &quot;to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|laws of the United States]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/faqs|title=FAQs|work=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially  [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]], the organization has been supported and criticized by liberal and conservative organizations alike.&lt;ref&gt;See [[American Civil Liberties Union#Support and opposition]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU works through [[litigation]] and [[lobbying]] and it has over 1,200,000 members and an annual budget of over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers [[civil liberties]] to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|briefs]] expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation.

In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include: opposing the death penalty; supporting [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and the [[LGBT adoption|right of LGBT people to adopt]]; supporting [[Reproductive rights|birth control and abortion rights]]; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and [[LGBT]] people; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; and opposing government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others.

Legally, the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated [[nonprofit organization]]s: the American Civil Liberties Union, a [[501(c)(4)]] social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)]] [[public charity]]. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political [[lobbying]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nonprofit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU and ACLU Foundation: What Is the Difference?|work=American Civil Liberties Union web site|publisher=ACLU|url=https://www.aclu.org/acluf.html|accessdate=September 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190151/https://www.aclu.org/acluf.html|archivedate=September 6, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ncrp.org/files/rp-articles/RP-Winter-2005-Maximizing_Nonprofit_Voices_and_Mobilizing_the_Public.pdf|title = Maximizing Nonprofit Voices and Mobilizing the Public|last = Krehely|first = Jeff|date = 2005|journal = Responsive Philanthropy|access-date = March 10, 2015|pages = 9–10, 15|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134943/http://ncrp.org/files/rp-articles/RP-Winter-2005-Maximizing_Nonprofit_Voices_and_Mobilizing_the_Public.pdf|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two organizations share office space and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/images/annualreports/asset_upload_file789_38050.pdf|title = Annual report fiscal year 2007|date = |accessdate = March 10, 2015|website = |publisher = American Civil Liberties Union|last = |first = |page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ACLU was founded in 1920 by a committee including [[Helen Keller]], [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Walter Nelles]], [[Morris Ernst]], [[Albert DeSilver]], [[Arthur Garfield Hays]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], and [[Rose Schneiderman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/03/23/why-free-speech-is-not-enough/|title=Why Free Speech Is Not Enough|last=Cole|first=David|date=2017-03-23|access-date=2019-09-23|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its focus was on [[freedom of speech]], primarily for anti-war protesters.&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/about-aclu |title=About the ACLU |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, and working with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) to decrease [[racism]] and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating [[police misconduct]] and supporting [[Native American rights]]. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] members and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During [[World War II]], the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]. During the [[Cold War]], the ACLU headquarters was dominated by [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.

By 1964, membership had risen to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand [[civil liberties]]. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce [[separation of church and state]]. It defended several [[anti-war activist]]s during the [[Vietnam War]]. The ACLU was involved in [[Miranda v. Arizona|the ''Miranda'' case]], which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in [[New York Times Co. v. United States|the ''New York Times'' case]], which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of [[creationism]] in public schools and challenged some provisions of [[Patriot Act|anti-terrorism legislation]] as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 election]]; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;WeigelResistance&quot;/&gt;

==Organization==

===Leadership===
The ACLU is led by a president and an executive director, [[Susan N. Herman]] and [[Anthony Romero]], respectively, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.aclu.org/bio/susan-n-herman Susan N. Herman, President].&quot; American Civil Liberties Union. Retrieved May 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.aclu.org/bio/anthony-d-romero Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director].&quot; American Civil Liberties Union. Retrieved May 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The president acts as chair of the ACLU's board of directors, leads fundraising, and facilitates policy-setting. The executive director manages the day-to-day operations of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/about/aclu_bylaws.pdf Bylaws of ACLU, Inc.]'', Organizational Policy No. 501 (undated).

Retrieved May 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The board of directors consists of 80 persons, including representatives from each state affiliate, as well as at-large delegates. The organization has its headquarters in [[125 Broad Street]], a 40-story skyscraper located in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/aclu-high-manhattan-article-1.583550|title = ACLU is high on Lower Manhattan|last = Croghan|first = Lore|date = February 28, 2005|work = [[New York Daily News]]|access-date = March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leadership of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend [[Henry Ford]]'s right to distribute anti-union literature.&lt;ref name=W102/&gt; In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit [[communism|communists]] from serving in ACLU leadership roles.&lt;ref name=W1323/&gt; During the early 1950s and [[Cold War]] [[McCarthyism]], the board was divided on whether to defend communists.&lt;ref name=W176201/&gt; In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent [[Benjamin Spock]]'s anti-war activism.&lt;ref name=W2845/&gt; In 1973, as the [[Watergate Scandal]] continued to unfold, leadership was initially divided over whether to call for President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s impeachment and removal from office.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 292–294&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, there was internal conflict about whether or not a [[gag rule]] should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Scott, [http://www.thenation.com/article/aclu-v-aclu &quot;ACLU v.

The ACLU solicits donations to its charitable foundation. The ACLU is accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]], and the [[Charity Navigator]] has ranked the ACLU with a four-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/civil-rights/american-civil-liberties-union-foundation-in-new-york-ny-227|title=Charity Report - American Civil Liberties Union Foundation  - give.org|work=bbb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3247|title=Charity Navigator Rating - American Civil Liberties Union Foundation|work=Charity Navigator}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local affiliates solicit their own funding; however, some also receive funds from the national ACLU, with the distribution and amount of such assistance varying from state to state. At its discretion, the national organization provides subsidies to smaller affiliates that lack sufficient resources to be self-sustaining; for example, the Wyoming ACLU chapter received such subsidies until April 2015, when, as part of a round of layoffs at the national ACLU, the Wyoming office was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, Gregory (April 1, 2015). [http://www.wyofile.com/blog/national-office-closes-wyoming-aclu-chapter/ National office closes Wyoming ACLU chapter]. ''Wyofile: People, Places &amp; Policy'' [Wyoming news service]. See paragraph 5. Nickerson mentions the Puerto Rico office, and a single office for North and South Dakota, as other examples of smaller offices receiving subsidies.

Consolidated Financial Report, March 31, 2014]'', p. 10, Note 1. Organization: &quot;Although the ACLU plays no direct role in the governance of ... the affiliates, the organizations jointly fund-raise and work together on certain programs and the ACLU, through either the Union or Foundation, as appropriate, at its sole discretion provides targeted financial and other support to the affiliates.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the ACLU rejected $1.5&amp;nbsp;million from both the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] because the foundations had adopted language from the USA PATRIOT Act in their donation agreements, including a clause stipulating that none of the money would go to &quot;underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities.&quot; The ACLU views this clause, both in federal law and in the donors' agreements, as a threat to civil liberties, saying it is overly broad and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=A.C.L.U. Rejects Foundation Grants Over Terror Language|author=Stephanie Strom|date=October 19, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/19/national/19aclu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Kaminer, pp. 68–70 for a discussion of an internal scandal in which Romero was accused of attempting to accept the funds without disclosing the terms to the ACLU board.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the nature of its legal work, the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments; a town, state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver. In some cases, the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief. In particular, the [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]] leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases. Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered &quot;equitable relief&quot; rather than damages, and government entities are not immune from equitable relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988-|title=Title 42, Chapter 21, Subchapter I, § 1988. Proceedings in vindication of civil rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under laws such as this, the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies. In 2006, the [[Veterans' Memorials, Boy Scouts, Public Seals, and Other Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act of 2006|Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act]] sought to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church-state separation.&lt;ref&gt;Report No. 109-657, H.R. 2679, available at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h2679rh.txt.pdf GPO].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has received court awarded fees from opponents, for example, the Georgia affiliate was awarded $150,000 in fees after suing a county demanding the removal of a [[Ten Commandments]] display from its courthouse;&lt;ref&gt;ACLU Georgia Press Release, [http://www.acluga.org/press.releases/0507/barrow.county.html &quot;Barrow County to Remove 10 Commandments Display&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222050743/http://www.acluga.org/press.releases/0507/barrow.county.html |date=December 22, 2005 }}, July 19, 2007 (last visited January 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; a second Ten Commandments case in the state, in a different county, led to a $74,462 judgment.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU Georgia, [http://www.acluga.org/docket.html &quot;2007 Litigation &amp; Advocacy Docket&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226043221/http://www.acluga.org/docket.html |date=December 26, 2005 }} (last visited January 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of Tennessee]] was required to pay $50,000, the State of Alabama $175,000, and the State of Kentucky $121,500, in similar Ten Commandments cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/07/09/loc_kytencommandments09.html|title=State pays ACLU $121,500 in Ten Commandments fight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, [http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cb.htm The Ten Commandments: Developments: Year 2002], ReligiousTolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

California has three affiliates.&lt;ref name=&quot;affiliates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Local ACLU Affiliates|work=American Civil Liberties Union web site|publisher=ACLU|url=https://www.aclu.org/affiliates|accessdate=August 20, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819175118/http://www.aclu.org/affiliates|archivedate=August 19, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affiliates operate autonomously from the national organization; each affiliate has its own staff, executive director, board of directors, and budget. Each affiliate consists of two non-profit corporations: a [[501(c)(3)]] corporation that does not perform lobbying, and a [[501(c)(4)]] corporation which is entitled to lobby.

ACLU affiliates are the basic unit of the ACLU's organization and engage in litigation, lobbying, and public education. For example, in a twenty-month period beginning January 2004, the [[American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey|ACLU's New Jersey chapter]] was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual report—thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases. {{update after|2017|3|17}}

===Positions===&lt;!-- Please respect alphabetical order --&gt;
The ACLU's official position statements, {{as of|2012|January|lc=y}}, included the following policies:
* '''Affirmative action''' – The ACLU supports [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affirmative Action|url=https://www.aclu.org/racial-justice/affirmative-action|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Birth control and abortion''' – The ACLU supports the right to abortion, as established in the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision. The ACLU believes that everyone should have affordable access to the full range of [[contraceptive]] options. The ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project manages efforts related to reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom Reproductive Freedom] Retrieved January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Campaign funding''' – The ACLU believes that the current system is badly flawed, and supports a system based on public funding. The ACLU supports full transparency to identify donors. However, the ACLU opposes attempts to control political spending. The ACLU supported the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'', which allowed corporations and unions more political speech rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/campaign-finance-reform Campaign Finance Reform] Retrieved January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Child pornography''' – The Arizona chapter of the ACLU believes that production of child pornography should be illegal, but that possessing it is protected by the [[right to privacy]]. &quot;Our policy is that possessing even pornographic material about children should not itself be a crime. The way to deal with this issue is to prosecute the makers of child pornography for exploiting minors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acluaz.org/sites/default/files/documents/Tough%20Questions%20about%20ACLU%20Positions.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tough Questions about ACLU Positions|work=acluaz.org|accessdate=December 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217034431/http://www.acluaz.org/sites/default/files/documents/Tough%20Questions%20about%20ACLU%20Positions.pdf|archive-date=December 17, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Gun politics in the United States|Gun rights]]''' – The national ACLU's position is that the Second Amendment protects a collective right to own guns rather than an individual right, despite the 2008 Supreme Court decision in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' that the Second Amendment is an individual right. The national organization's position is based on the phrases &quot;a well regulated Militia&quot; and &quot;the security of a free State&quot;. However, the ACLU opposes any effort to create a registry of gun owners and has worked with the [[National Rifle Association]] to prevent a registry from being created, and it has favored protecting the right to carry guns under the 4th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/racial-justice_prisoners-rights_drug-law-reform_immigrants-rights/second-amendment Second Amendment], January 17, 2013.

* '''HIV/AIDS''' – The policy of the ACLU is to &quot;create a world in which discrimination based on HIV status has ended, people with HIV have control over their medical information and care, and where the government's HIV policy promotes public health and respect and compassion for people living with HIV and AIDS.&quot; This effort is managed by the ACLU's AIDS Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/hiv-aids HIV/AIDS] Retrieved January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Prisoners' rights''' – The ACLU's National Prison Project believes that incarceration should only be used as a last resort, and that prisons should focus on rehabilitation. The ACLU works to ensure that prisons treat prisoners in accordance with the Constitution and domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights Prisoners' Rights] Retrieved January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Privacy and technology''' – The ACLU's Project on Speech, Privacy, and Technology promotes &quot;responsible uses of technology that enhance privacy protection&quot;, and opposes uses &quot;that undermine our freedoms and move us closer to a [[Mass surveillance|surveillance society]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty Technology and Liberty] Retrieved January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aclu.org. Retrieved on May 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Voting rights''' – The ACLU believes that impediments to voting should be eliminated, particularly if they disproportionately impact minority or poor citizens.

===Support and opposition===
The ACLU is supported by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. Allies of the ACLU in legal actions have included the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[American Jewish Congress]], [[People For the American Way]], the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and the [[National Organization for Women]].

The ACLU has been criticized by [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], such as when it excluded [[Communism|communists]] from its leadership ranks, when it defended [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]], when it declined to defend [[Paul Robeson]], or when it opposed the passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Finan, Christopher M. (2007), ''From the Palmer Raids to the Patriot Act: a history of the fight for free speech in America'', Beacon Press, pp. 158–159. (Robeson)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skokie/&gt; Conversely, it has been criticized by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, or when it opposed the [[Patriot Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 219–220 (prayer in school).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.watchdog.org/issues/accountability/survey-highlights-nonpartisan-aclu-s-liberal-biases/article_8489a54a-0798-58bf-a075-f413a54f6c96.html|title=Survey highlights 'nonpartisan' ACLU's liberal biases|last=Kittle|first=M.D.|work=Watchdog.org|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[George Wallace]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[Oliver North]]; and it has supported liberal figures such as [[Dick Gregory]], [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref name=W2845/&gt;&lt;ref name=FOXRush/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker p 242 (Wallace).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 103.

(Kent)&lt;/ref&gt;

A major source of criticism are legal cases in which the ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints, such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], Neo-Nazis, [[Nation of Islam]], [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]], [[Westboro Baptist Church]] or [[Unite the Right rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-statement-charlottesville-violence-and-demonstrations|title=ACLU Statement on Charlottesville Violence and Demonstrations|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/aclu-free-speech-white-supremacy/index.html|title=ACLU takes heat for its free-speech defense|last=Biskupic|first=Joan|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/nyregion/aclu-free-speech-rights-charlottesville-skokie-rally.html|title=After Backing Alt-Right in Charlottesville, A.C.L.U.

But the defense of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-statement-defending-free-speech-unpopular-organizations ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations], August 31, 2000.

==Early years==

===CLB era===
[[File:CrystalEastman.jpeg|thumb|[[Crystal Eastman]] was one of the co-founders of the CLB, the predecessor to the ACLU]]

The ACLU developed from the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] (CLB), co-founded in 1917 during [[World War I]] by [[Crystal Eastman]], an attorney activist, and [[Roger Nash Baldwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp.17 and 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the CLB was on [[freedom of speech]], primarily anti-war speech, and on supporting [[conscientious objector]]s who did not want to serve in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 23–24, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against certain kinds of anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the [[Schenck v. United States|conviction]] of [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] leader [[Charles Schenck]] for publishing anti-war literature.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Debs v. United States]],'' the court upheld the conviction of [[Eugene Debs]]. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat [[freedom of speech]] as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; After assuming sole leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized. He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education.&lt;ref name=W47&gt;Walker, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref name=W47/&gt; Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme.&lt;ref name=W47/&gt; Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchisement]] of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century.

During the first decades of the ACLU, [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Baldwin]] continued as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;Walker, p 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, and it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the [[Garland Fund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt;

===Free speech era===

In the 1920s, government censorship was commonplace. Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti-obscenity [[Comstock laws]]; permits for labor rallies were often denied; and virtually all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_a&quot;&gt;Walker, p. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_a&quot; /&gt; In one typical instance in 1923, author [[Upton Sinclair]] was arrested for trying to read the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] during an [[Industrial Workers of the World]] rally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_b&quot;&gt;Walker, p 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norman Thomas 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Norman Thomas]] was one of the early leaders of the ACLU]]
ACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] and [[Norman Thomas]], believed that direct, militant action was the best path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_b&quot; /&gt; Hays was the first of many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU.&lt;ref name=W53&gt;Walker, p 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Another group, including [[Walter Nelles]] and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change.&lt;ref name=W53/&gt; Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.&lt;ref name=W53/&gt;

During the 1920s, the ACLU's primary focus was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor movement particularly.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Because most of the ACLU's efforts were associated with the labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the [[American Legion]], the [[National Civic Federation]], and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU, working with the [[NAACP]], also supported racial discrimination cases.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|government search and seizure]] issues, [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]], or [[wiretapping]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party USA]] was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU.&lt;ref name=W63&gt;Walker, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal conduct such as denying their party membership under oath. This led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU.&lt;ref name=W63/&gt; Communist leaders sometimes attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives, whereas Communists tried to disrupt speeches by critics of the USSR.&lt;ref name=W63/&gt; This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.&lt;ref name=W63/&gt;

===Public schools===
====Scopes trial====
When 1925 arrived {{en dash}} five years after the ACLU was formed {{en dash}} the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded [[John T. Scopes]] to defy Tennessee's anti-[[evolution]] law in ''[[Scopes Trial|The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes]]''. [[Clarence Darrow]], a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching [[creationism]] in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.&lt;ref&gt;University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopes.htm &quot;''Tennessee v. John Scopes'': The 'Monkey Trial' (1925)&quot;], ''Famous Trials in American History'', last updated April 25, 2005 (last visited January 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopeschrono.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409145806/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopeschrono.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-04-09|title=The Evolution-Creationism Controversy: A Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scopes trial was a phenomenal public relations success for the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major US newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 75. The newspaper was the ''St. Louis Post Dispatch''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' and the 2005 case ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, Michael (2010), ''Evolution, Creationism, and the Battle to Control America's Classrooms'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin himself was involved in an important free speech victory of the 1920s, after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey. Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey, the appeals court's judgement in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given &quot;liberal and comprehensive construction&quot;, and it marked a major turning point in the [[civil rights movement]], signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 78–79. The case was in New Jersey, ''State v. Butterworth''. Decision quoted by Walker.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important ACLU case of the 1920s was ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', in which [[Benjamin Gitlow]] was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism.&lt;ref&gt;Walker. p 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the [[incorporation doctrine]]) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.&lt;ref&gt;Walker. p 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pierce v. Society of Sisters''====
{{main|Pierce v. Society of Sisters}}
{{see also|Political activity of the Knights of Columbus}}

After the First World War, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about &quot;foreign&quot; values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]]. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating [[parochial school]]s, including Catholic schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;pierce&quot;&gt;{{ussc|268|510|1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oregon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1924/1924_583| title = Pierce v. Society of Sisters| publisher = University of Chicago Kent School of Law| accessdate = 28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was promoted by groups such as the [[Knights of Pythias]], the Federation of Patriotic Societies, the Oregon Good Government League, the [[Orange Order]], and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=282}}

The [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]] required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] by 1926.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=282}} Associate Director [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], a personal friend of [[Luke E. Hart]], the then–Supreme Advocate and future [[Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus|Supreme Knight]] of the [[Knights of Columbus]], offered to join forces with the Knights to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=283}}

The case became known as ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', a seminal [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that significantly expanded coverage of the [[Due Process Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In a unanimous decision, the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.{{sfn|Alley|1999|pp=41–44}} It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.

===First victories===
Leaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. [[Felix Frankfurter]] felt that legislation was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (and {{en dash}} in his opinion {{en dash}} should not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But [[Walter Herries Pollock|Walter Pollack]], [[Morris Ernst]], and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 81&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 82. The cases included Gitlow (1925), Whitney (1927), Powell (1932) and Patterson (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free speech===
[[File:H l mencken.jpg|thumb|The ACLU defended [[H. L. Mencken]] when he was arrested for distributing banned literature]]

Censorship was commonplace in the early 20th century. State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization.&lt;ref name=W82&gt;Walker, p 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature.&lt;ref name=W82/&gt; In that year, [[H. L. Mencken]] deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned ''[[American Mercury]]'' magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal.&lt;ref name=W82/&gt; The ACLU went on to win additional victories, including the landmark case ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'' in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name=W86&gt;Walker, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' and ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'' cases.

The [[Comstock laws]] banned distribution of sex education information, based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior&lt;ref name=W85&gt;Walker, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Ware Dennett]] was fined $300 in 1928, for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge [[Learned Hand]] ruled that the pamphlet's main purpose was to &quot;promote understanding&quot;.&lt;ref name=W85/&gt;

The success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature.&lt;ref name=W85/&gt; The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort.&lt;ref name=W85/&gt; By the early 1930s, [[censorship in the United States]] was diminishing.&lt;ref name=W86/&gt;

Two major victories in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] to subject states to the requirements of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise [[prior restraint]] and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==
The late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States.&lt;ref name=W112&gt;Walker, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; National leaders hailed the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy.&lt;ref name=W112/&gt; The 1939 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]]'' affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause.&lt;ref name=W112/&gt; Even conservative elements, such as the [[American Bar Association]] began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.&lt;ref name=W112/&gt;

===Expansion===
In 1929, after the Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin perceived that there was vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States.&lt;ref name=W86/&gt; Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, [[African American]] rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties.&lt;ref name=W86/&gt; The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.&lt;ref name=W87&gt;Walker, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932 [[Norris–La Guardia Act]], a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions.&lt;ref name=W87/&gt; The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report ''Lawlessness in Law Enforcement'' in 1931, under the auspices of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Wickersham Commission]].&lt;ref name=W87/&gt; In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.&lt;ref name=W87/&gt;

Although the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans, the ACLU did engage in educational efforts, and published ''Black Justice'' in 1931, a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South, including lack of voting rights, segregation, and discrimination in the justice system.&lt;ref name=W88&gt;Walker, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by the [[Garland Fund]], the ACLU also participated in producing the influential [[Margold Report]], which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks.&lt;ref name=W89&gt;Walker, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Margold Report was named after its principal author, [[Nathan Ross Margold]], a white attorney.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU's plan was to demonstrate that the &quot;[[separate but equal]]&quot; policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never, in fact, treated equally.&lt;ref name=W89/&gt;

===Depression era and the New Deal===
In 1932{{spaced ndash}}twelve years after the ACLU was founded{{spaced ndash}}it had achieved significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; But the [[Great Depression]] brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration proposed the [[New Deal]] to combat the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the [[National Recovery Administration]] suspended antitrust legislation.&lt;ref name=W96&gt;Walker, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many [[civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]] to key positions, including Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], a member of the ACLU.&lt;ref name=W96/&gt;&lt;ref name=W97&gt;Walker, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not.&lt;ref name=W97/&gt; In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene.&lt;ref name=W100&gt;Walker, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's April 11, 1938, issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.&lt;ref name=W99&gt;Walker, p. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information. This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934; a Catholic priest would not be represented there again until the 1970s.&lt;ref name=W98&gt;Walker, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 [[court-packing plan]], which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation.&lt;ref name=W105&gt;Walker, p. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court responded by making a [[The switch in time that saved nine|major shift in policy]], and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.&lt;ref name=W105/&gt;

The first decision that marked the court's new direction was ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]'', in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization.&lt;ref name=W106&gt;Walker, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU attorney [[Osmond Fraenkel]], working with [[International Labor Defense]], defended De Jonge in 1937, and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that &quot;peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Court decision quoted by Walker, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years, during which Roosevelt appointees (led by [[Hugo Black]], [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Frank Murphy]]) established a body of civil liberties law.&lt;ref name=W106/&gt; In 1938, Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]] wrote the famous &quot;footnote four&quot; in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would{{spaced ndash}}henceforth{{spaced ndash}}require compelling justification.&lt;ref name=W107&gt;Walker, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] proposed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no stand on the legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government.&lt;ref name=W101&gt;Wagner, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to [[Henry Ford]], prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature.&lt;ref name=W102&gt;Walker, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action.&lt;ref name=W102/&gt; But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech.&lt;ref name=W102/&gt; ACLU leader [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come.&lt;ref name=W102/&gt;

The ACLU's support of the NLRB was a major development for the ACLU, because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties.&lt;ref name=W103&gt;Walker, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations.&lt;ref name=W103/&gt;

Some factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal.&lt;ref name=W104&gt;Walker, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.&lt;ref name=W104/&gt;

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
The ACLU's support of defendants with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties.&lt;ref name=W107/&gt; One such defendant was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], who were involved in a [[United States Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses|large number of Supreme Court cases]].&lt;ref name=W107/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ACLU was not the primary legal representative; the Witnesses had their own legal team, led by [[Hayden C. Covington]] during this era.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases that the ACLU supported included ''[[Lovell v. City of Griffin]]'' (which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute &quot;literature of any kind&quot;); ''[[Martin v. Struthers]]'' (which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing); and ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'' (which reversed the conviction of a Witness who was reciting offensive speech on a street corner).&lt;ref name=W108&gt;Walker, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes.&lt;ref name=W108/&gt; The Jehovah's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs. Two children were convicted in 1938 of not saluting the flag.&lt;ref name=W108/&gt; The ACLU supported their appeal to the Supreme Court, but the court affirmed the conviction, in 1940.&lt;ref name=W109&gt;Walker, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; But three years later, in ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'', the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote &quot;If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.&quot; To underscore its decision, the Supreme Court announced it on [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]].&lt;ref name=W109/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Robert Jackson quoted by Walker, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communism and totalitarianism===
[[File:Elizabeth Gurley Flynn point.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] was voted off the ACLU board in 1940 because of her Communist Party membership, but reinstated posthumously in 1970]]

The rise of [[totalitarian]] regimes in Germany, Russia, and other countries who rejected freedom of speech and association had a large impact on the civil liberties movement in the US; anti-Communist sentiment rose and civil liberties were curtailed.&lt;ref name=W115&gt;Walker, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro-[[Nazi]] speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis.&lt;ref name=W116&gt;Walker, p. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=W117&gt;Walker, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature.&lt;ref name=W117/&gt; The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=W117/&gt; The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, the ACLU allied itself with the [[Communist Party of the United States#The Popular Front (1935–1939)|Popular Front]], a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the [[Communist Party USA|United States Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=W118&gt;Walker, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York-based ACLU.&lt;ref name=W118/&gt; The association with the Communist Party led to accusations that the ACLU was a &quot;Communist front&quot;, particularly because [[Harry F. Ward]] was both chairman of the ACLU and chairman of the [[American League Against War and Fascism]], a Communist organization.&lt;ref name=W119&gt;Walker, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) was created in 1938 to uncover sedition and treason within the United States.&lt;ref name=W120&gt;Walker, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; When witnesses testified at its hearings, the ACLU was mentioned several times, leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its 1939 report.&lt;ref name=W121&gt;Walker, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; This damaged the ACLU's reputation severely, even though the report said that it could not &quot;definitely state whether or not&quot; the ACLU was a Communist organization.&lt;ref name=W121/&gt;

While the ACLU rushed to defend its image against allegations of being a Communist front, it also worked to protect witnesses who were being harassed by the HUAC.&lt;ref name=W122&gt;Walker, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest (unsuccessfully) against passage of the [[Smith Act]] in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism.&lt;ref name=W123&gt;Walker, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Smith Act was ruled unconstitutional in 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader [[Harry Bridges]].&lt;ref name=W133&gt;Walker, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

ACLU leadership was split on whether to purge its leadership of Communists. [[Norman Thomas]], [[John Haynes Holmes]], and [[Morris Ernst]] were anti-Communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from Communism; opposing them were Harry F. Ward, [[Corliss Lamont]], and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership.&lt;ref name=W128&gt;Walker, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-Communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Ward immediately resigned, and{{spaced ndash}}following a contentious six-hour debate{{spaced ndash}}Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board.&lt;ref name=W1323&gt;Walker, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1940 resolution was considered by many to be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.&lt;ref name=W133/&gt;

==Mid-century==

===World War II===
When World War II engulfed the United States, the Bill of Rights was enshrined as a hallowed document, and numerous organizations defended civil liberties.&lt;ref name=W140&gt;Walker, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago and New York proclaimed &quot;Civil Rights&quot; weeks, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a national Bill of Rights day. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was the keynote speaker at the 1939 ACLU convention.&lt;ref name=W140/&gt; In spite of this newfound respect for civil rights, Americans were becoming adamantly anti-communist, and believed that excluding communists from American society was an essential step to preserve democracy.&lt;ref name=W140/&gt;

Contrasted with World War I, there was relatively little violation of civil liberties during World War II. President Roosevelt was a strong supporter of civil liberties, but{{spaced ndash}}more importantly{{spaced ndash}}there were few anti-war activists during World War II.&lt;ref name=W135&gt;Walker, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant exception was the [[internment of Japanese Americans]].&lt;ref name=W135/&gt;

====Japanese American Internment====
[[File:Photograph of Members of the Mochida Family Awaiting Evacuation - NARA - 537505 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|left|The ACLU was internally divided when it came to defending the rights of Japanese Americans who had been [[Internment of Japanese Americans|forcibly relocated to internment camps]]]]
Two months after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], Roosevelt authorized the creation of military &quot;exclusion zones&quot; with [[Executive Order 9066]], paving the way for the detention of all West Coast [[Japanese American]]s in inland camps. In addition to the non-citizen [[Issei]] (prohibited from [[naturalization]] as members of an &quot;unassimilable&quot; race), over two-thirds of those swept up were American-born citizens.&lt;ref name=W137&gt;Walker, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt, comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref name=W138&gt;Walker, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU was the only major organization to object to the internment plan,&lt;ref name=W135/&gt; and their position was very unpopular, even within the organization. Not all ACLU leaders wanted to defend the Japanese Americans; Roosevelt loyalists such as Morris Ernst wanted to support Roosevelt's war effort, but pacifists such as Baldwin and Norman Thomas felt that Japanese Americans needed access to due process before they could be imprisoned.&lt;ref name=W139&gt;Walker, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 20, 1942, letter to Roosevelt, Baldwin called on the administration to allow Japanese Americans to prove their loyalty at individual hearings, describing the constitutionality of the planned removal &quot;open to grave question.&quot;&lt;ref name=Niiya-ACLU&gt;{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Brian |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/American_Civil_Liberties_Union/ |title=American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His suggestions went nowhere, and opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the &quot;evacuation&quot; of the West Coast. In May, the two factions, one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued, the other advocating support for the President's policy of removing citizens whose &quot;presence may endanger national security,&quot; brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU's national leaders. They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens, and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so.&lt;ref name=Niiya-ACLU/&gt;

The ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]'s lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney [[A.L. Wirin]] continued to represent [[Ernest Kinzo Wakayama]] but without addressing the case's constitutional questions.&lt;ref name=Niiya-ACLU/&gt; (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.)&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the San Francisco branch, led by [[Ernest Besig]], refused to discontinue its support for [[Fred Korematsu]], whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney [[Wayne M. Collins|Wayne Collins]], with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.&lt;ref name=Niiya-ACLU/&gt;

The West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court, but had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=W138/&gt; ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'' came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an [[Amicus brief|''amicus'' brief]]. Besig, dissatisfied with [[Osmond Fraenkel]]'s tamer defense, filed an additional ''amicus'' brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in ''[[Yasui v. United States]]'' (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ''[[ex parte Endo]]'', was also aided by two ''amicus'' briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.&lt;ref name=Niiya-ACLU/&gt;

''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' proved to be the most controversial of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to the national ACLU office's pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside [[Charles Antone Horsky|Charles Horsky]], although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed.&lt;ref name=Niiya-ACLU/&gt; The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in ''[[coram nobis]]'' proceedings in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Chin, Steven A. ''When Justice Failed: The Fred Korematsu Story'', Raintree, 1992, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national office of the ACLU was even more reluctant to defend anti-war protesters. A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States' war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who [[Renunciation Act of 1944|renounced their US citizenship]] during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for &quot;repatriation.&quot; (A significant number of those slated to &quot;go back&quot; to Japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated.) Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake Segregation Center]], where the majority of these &quot;renunciants&quot; were concentrated, and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the renunciations had been given under duress. The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants, forcing Collins to pursue the case on his own, although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Niiya |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Ernest%20Besig/ |title=Ernest Besig |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 1944 visit to Tule Lake, Besig had also became aware of a hastily constructed stockade in which Japanese American internees were routinely being brutalized and held for months without due process.  Besig was forbidden by the national ACLU office to intervene on behalf of the stockade prisoners or even to visit the Tule Lake camp without prior written approval from Baldwin.  Unable to help directly, Besig turned to Wayne Collins for assistance.  Collins, using the threat of habeas corpus suits managed to have the stockade closed down.  A year later, after learning that the stockade had been reestablished, he returned to the camp and had it closed down for good.&lt;ref name=yamato&gt;{{Cite news |last=Yamato |first=Sharon |title=Carrying the Torch: Wayne Collins Jr. on His Father's Defense of the Renunciants |newspaper=Discover Nikkei |date=October 21, 2014 |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/10/21/carrying-the-torch/ |access-date=September 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728191547/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/10/21/carrying-the-torch/ |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wollenberg49&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wollenberg | first = Charles | title = Rebel Lawyer: Wayne Collins and the Defense of Japanese American Rights | publisher = Heyday | year = 2018 | pages = 49–51 | isbn = 9781597144360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1945====
When the war ended in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had accumulated an impressive set of legal victories.&lt;ref name=W186&gt;Walker, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Harry S. Truman]] sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU on the occasion of their 25th anniversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;W186&quot;/&gt; American attitudes had changed since World War I, and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness.&lt;ref name=&quot;W186&quot;/&gt; The Bill of Rights was more respected, and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed.&lt;ref name=&quot;W186&quot;/&gt; During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, and the list included racial discrimination and separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU supported the African-American defendants in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', when they tried to occupy a house they had purchased in a neighborhood which had racially restrictive housing covenants. The African-American purchasers won the case in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War era===
Anti-Communist sentiment gripped the United States during the [[Cold War]] beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations to lose their jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored the civil rights of Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.

The ACLU was internally divided when it purged Communists from its leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.&lt;ref name=W176201&gt;Walker, pp. 176, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, President Truman issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which created the [[Federal Loyalty Program]]. This program authorized the Attorney General to create a list of organizations which were deemed to be subversive.&lt;ref&gt;walker, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment.&lt;ref name=W177&gt;Walker, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Listed organizations were not notified that they were being considered for the list, nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list.&lt;ref name=W179&gt;Walker, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program, some challenges were successfully made.&lt;ref name=W179/&gt;

Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood directors and writers, the ''[[Hollywood Ten]]'', intending to ask them to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for [[contempt of Congress]]. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal.&lt;ref name=W181&gt;Walker, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a [[blacklist]] which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed.&lt;ref name=W181/&gt; The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report ''The Judges and the Judged'', prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]], described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DennisEugene.jpg|thumb|left|The ACLU chose not to support [[Eugene Dennis]] or other leaders of the US Communist Party, and they were all imprisoned, along with their attorneys]]
The federal government took direct aim at the US Communist Party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the [[Foley Square trial]].&lt;ref name=W185&gt;Walker, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government.&lt;ref name=W185/&gt; The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison.&lt;ref name=W185/&gt; Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred.&lt;ref name=&quot;W186&quot; /&gt; When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them.&lt;ref name=&quot;W186&quot;/&gt; Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.&lt;ref name=&quot;W186&quot;/&gt;

The ACLU, in a change of heart, supported the party leaders during their appeal process. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in the ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' decision by softening the free speech requirements from a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test, to a &quot;grave and probable&quot; test.&lt;ref name=W187&gt;Walker, p 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the ''Dennis'' decision, and resolved to fight it.&lt;ref name=W187/&gt; One reason for the Supreme Court's support of cold war legislation was the 1949 deaths of Supreme Court justices [[Frank Murphy]] and [[Wiley Rutledge]], leaving [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O. Douglas]] as the only remaining civil libertarians on the Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_c&quot;&gt;Walker, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dennis'' decision paved the way for the prosecution of hundreds of other Communist party members.&lt;ref name=W188&gt;Walker, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld.&lt;ref name=W188/&gt; The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_c&quot; /&gt;

The ACLU also challenged many loyalty oath requirements across the country, but the courts upheld most of the loyalty oath laws.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 190. The case was ''[[Speiser v. Randall]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court, until 1957, upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of Communists.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, photo caption of Flynn, page following 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU, even though it scaled back its defense of Communists during the Cold War, still came under heavy criticism as a &quot;front&quot; for Communism. Critics included the [[American Legion]], Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], the HUAC, and the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 193, 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI, and as a consequence, the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints alleging abuse of power by the FBI during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 191–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Raymond L. Wise]], ACLU board member 1933–1951, defended [[William Perl]], one of the other spies embroiled in the atomic espionage cases (made famous by the execution of [[Julius Rosenberg]] and [[Ethel Rosenberg]]).&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;

===Organizational change===
In 1950, the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position, and he was replaced by [[Patrick Murphy Malin]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Malin's guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955{{spaced ndash}}the start of a 24-year period of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974.&lt;ref name=W207&gt;Walker, p 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.&lt;ref name=W207/&gt;

The ACLU, which had been controlled by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions.&lt;ref name=W208&gt;Walker, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.&lt;ref name=W208/&gt;

===McCarthyism era===
[[File:Paul Robeson 1942 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|In the 1950s the ACLU chose to not support [[Paul Robeson]] and other leftist defendants, a decision that would be heavily criticized in the future.]]

During the early 1950s, the ACLU continued to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When leftist singer [[Paul Robeson]] was denied a passport in 1950, even though he was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not defend him.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported [[William Worthy]] and [[Rockwell Kent]] in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees chose to use the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fifth amendment]] protection against [[self-incrimination]] to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established policies which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the fifth amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt; The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading the fifth amendment, but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case which reversed his termination.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 202. The case was ''[[Slochower v. Board of Higher Education of New York City]]'', 350 US 551 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth amendment issue became the catalyst for a watershed event in 1954, which finally resolved the ACLU's ambivalence by ousting the anti-communists from ACLU leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 208–211.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the anti-communists, led by [[Norman Thomas]] and [[James Fly]], proposed a set of resolutions that inferred guilt of persons that invoked the fifth amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;W208&quot; /&gt; These resolutions were the first that fell under the ACLU's new organizational rules permitting local affiliates to participate in the vote; the affiliates outvoted the national headquarters, and rejected the anti-communist resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-communists leaders refused to accept the results of the vote, and brought the issue up for discussion again at the 1954 bi-annual convention.&lt;ref name=W210&gt;Walker, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU member [[Frank Porter Graham|Frank Graham]], president of the [[University of North Carolina]], attacked the anti-communists with a counter-proposal, which stated that the ACLU &quot;stand[s] against guilt by association, judgment by accusation, the invasion of privacy of personal opinions and beliefs, and the confusion of dissent with disloyalty.&quot;&lt;ref name=W210/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham's proposal quoted in Walker&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-communists continued to battle Graham's proposal, but were outnumbered by the affiliates. The anti-communists finally gave up and departed the board of directors in late 1954 and 1955, ending an eight-year reign of ambivalence within the ACLU leadership ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the ACLU proceeded with firmer resolve against Cold War anti-communist legislation.&lt;ref name=W211&gt;Walker, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The period from the 1940 resolution (and the purge of Elizabeth Flynn) to the 1954 resignation of the anti-communist leaders is considered by many to be an era in which the ACLU abandoned its core principles.&lt;ref name=W211/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Corliss Lamont]], in particular, portrayed that era as a major lapse of principle.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthyism declined in late 1954 after television journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] and others publicly chastised McCarthy.&lt;ref name=W212&gt;Walker, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were generated by the Cold War ushered in a new era in American Civil liberties. In 1954, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 213–214, 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court handed the ACLU two key victories in 1957, in ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'' and ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', both of which undermined the [[Smith Act]] and marked the beginning of the end of communist party membership inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 240–242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including ''[[Lamont v. Postmaster General]]'' (in which the plaintiff was [[Corliss Lamont]], a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s==
The decade from 1954 to 1964 was the most successful period in the ACLU's history.&lt;ref name=W217&gt;Walker, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states.&lt;ref name=W217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Membership numbers are from 1955 and 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; During the ACLU's bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight cases in which the ACLU was involved; the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_d&quot;&gt;Walker, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU played a role in Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects.&lt;ref name=W217/&gt; The ACLU's success arose from changing public attitudes; the American populace was more educated, more tolerant, and more willing to accept unorthodox behavior.&lt;ref name=W217/&gt;

===Separation of church and state===
[[File:HugoLaFayetteBlack.jpg|thumb|upright|Supreme Court justice [[Hugo Black]] often endorsed the ACLU's position on the separation of church and state]]

Legal battles concerning the separation of church and state originated in laws dating to 1938 which required religious instruction in school, or provided state funding for religious schools.&lt;ref name=W219&gt;Walker, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws; and the primary opponents (the &quot;separationists&quot;) were the ACLU, [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and the [[American Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref name=W219/&gt; The ACLU led the challenge in the 1947 ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' case, in which Justice Hugo Black wrote &quot;[t]he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state.... That wall must be kept high and impregnable.&quot;&lt;ref name=W219/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black quoted by Walker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black was paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson, who first employed the metaphor of a wall. Urofsky, Melvin, &quot;Church and State&quot;, in Bodenhamer, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education, and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents, arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a &quot;national school board&quot;, and that the Constitution did not govern social issues.&lt;ref name=W221&gt;Walker, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ACLU and other advocates of church/state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=W221/&gt; Historian [[Samuel Walker (historian)|Samuel Walker]] writes that the ACLU's &quot;greatest impact on American life&quot; was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to &quot;constitutionalize&quot; so many public controversies.&lt;ref name=W221/&gt;

In 1948, the ACLU prevailed in the ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' case, which challenged public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for from private funds.&lt;ref name=W221/&gt; The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms.&lt;ref name=W222&gt;Walker, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion.&lt;ref name=W223&gt;Walker, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading.&lt;ref name=W223/&gt; The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the [[School Prayer Amendment|School Prayer Constitutional Amendment]], which declared in-school prayer legal.&lt;ref name=W225&gt;Walker, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name=W225/&gt;

However, not all cases were victories; ACLU lost cases in 1949 and 1961 which challenged state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath.&lt;ref name=W222/&gt; The Supreme Court has never overturned such laws, although some states subsequently revoked many of the laws under pressure from commercial interests.&lt;ref name=W222/&gt;

===Freedom of expression===
During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU continued its battle against censorship of art and literature.&lt;ref name=W227&gt;Walker, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of [[Carl Jacob Kunz]], who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of [[Irving Feiner]] who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion.&lt;ref name=W229&gt;Walker, p 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU lost the case of [[Joseph Beauharnais]], who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.&lt;ref name=W230&gt;Walker, p 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities across America routinely banned movies because they were deemed to be &quot;harmful&quot;, &quot;offensive&quot;, or &quot;immoral&quot;{{spaced ndash}}censorship which was validated by the 1915 ''[[Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Commission of Ohio|Mutual v. Ohio]]'' Supreme Court decision which held movies to be mere commerce, undeserving of first amendment protection.&lt;ref name=W231&gt;Walker, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[L'Amore (film)|The Miracle]]'' was banned in New York in 1951, at the behest of the Catholic Church, but the ACLU supported the film's distributor in an appeal of the ban, and won a major victory in the 1952 decision ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]''.&lt;ref name=W231/&gt; The Catholic Church led efforts throughout the 1950s attempting to persuade local prosecutors to ban various books and movies, leading to conflict with the ACLU when the ACLU published it statement condemning the church's tactics.&lt;ref name=W232&gt;Walker, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Further legal actions by the ACLU successfully defended films such as ''[[M (1951 film)|M]]'' and ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|la Ronde]]'', leading the eventual dismantling of movie censorship.&lt;ref name=W231/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood continued employing self-censorship with its own [[Production Code]], but in 1956 the ACLU called on Hollywood to abolish the Code.&lt;ref name=W233&gt;Walker, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU defended [[beat generation]] artists, including [[Allen Ginsberg]] who was prosecuted for his poem &quot;[[Howl]]&quot;; and{{spaced ndash}}in an unorthodox case{{spaced ndash}} the ACLU helped a coffee house regain its restaurant license which was revoked because its Beat customers were allegedly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU lost an [[Roth v. United States|important press censorship case]] when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher [[Samuel Roth]] for distributing adult magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1953, books such as ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' and ''[[From Here to Eternity (novel)|From Here to Eternity]]'' were still banned.&lt;ref name=W227/&gt; But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_d&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=W227/&gt;

===Racial discrimination===
A major aspect of civil liberties progress after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments{{spaced ndash}} an effort generally associated with the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=W238&gt;Walker, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the ACLU, and the [[American Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref name=W238/&gt; The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]]), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with [[amicus brief]]s.&lt;ref name=W238/&gt; The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the ''[[Henderson v. United States (1950)|Henderson v. United States]]'' decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.&lt;ref name=W238/&gt;

In 1954, the ACLU filed an [[amicus brief]] in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which led to the ban on racial segregation in US [[public school (government funded)|public schools]].&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, ''ACLU Amicus Brief in Brown v. Board of Education'', October 11, 1952 ([https://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/gen/15901lgl19521011.html PDF brief]).&lt;/ref&gt; Southern states instituted a McCarthyism-style witch-hunt against the NAACP, attempting it to disclose membership lists. The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation; in 1964 the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower income urban residents, in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', which required states to establish the voting districts in accordance with the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp255– 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police misconduct===
The ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (right to an attorney), and including 1942's ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'' (right to an attorney), and 1951's ''[[Rochin v. California]]'' (involuntary stomach pumping).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 246–250.&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 246–248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, ''Secret Detention by the Chicago Police'', which documented unlawful detention by police.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 249–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 252–253.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in ''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; And, in 1966, ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to [[Minor (law)|juveniles]] in the following year's ''[[in re Gault]]'' (1967) federal ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties revolution of the 1960s===
The 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walkerpp&quot;&gt;Walker, pp. 257, 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as [[sit in]]s and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 262–264.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as [[gay rights]], [[prisoner's rights]], [[abortion]], rights of the poor, and the death penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walkerpp&quot; /&gt; Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970.&lt;ref name=W262&gt;Walker, p 262&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states.&lt;ref name=W262 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The count of affiliates is of affiliates with a permanent staff.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving [[amicus briefs]] submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested.&lt;ref name=W262 /&gt; At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from &quot;disengaged and elitist&quot; to &quot;emotionally engaged&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 263. Characterizations by Samuel Walker.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled ''How Americans Protest'', which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students [[Greensboro sit-ins|staged a sit-in]] in a segregated North Carolina department store, the [[sit-in movement]] gained momentum across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1960–61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.&lt;ref name=W263 /&gt; The ACLU also provided legal help for the [[Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides]] in 1961, the [[Civil rights movement#Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956–1965|integration of the University of Mississippi]], the [[Birmingham campaign]] in 1963, and the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]].&lt;ref name=W263&gt;Walker, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAACP was responsible for managing most sit-in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision.&lt;ref name=W264&gt;Walker, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestors{{spaced ndash}}white and black{{spaced ndash}}who were arrested while protesting in the South.&lt;ref name=W264 /&gt; The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to serving Southern issues.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (''[[Whitus v. Georgia]]''), desegregating prisons (''[[Lee v. Washington]]''), and [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|reforming election laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman [[Julian Bond]] in ''[[Bond v. Floyd]]'', when the [[Georgia House of Representatives|Georgia congress]] refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 270–271.&lt;/ref&gt; Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, who was convicted of refusing to train [[Green Berets]]. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in ''Parker v. Levy'', 417 US 733 (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the ACLU won a major victory for free speech, when it defended [[Dick Gregory]] after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago. The court ruled in ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when the hostility is initiated by someone in the audience, as that would amount to a &quot;heckler's veto&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/successes-american-civil-liberties-union ACLU list of successes]; the case was ''Gregory v. Chicago'', 394 US 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
The ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: defending [[draft resister]]s, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the [[Watergate scandal|potential impeachment of Richard Nixon]], and the use of national security concerns to preemptively [[Censorship|censor]] newspapers.

David J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his [[draft card]]. The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction (367 F.2d 72: ''United States of America v. David J. Miller'', 1966), but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O'Brien to the Supreme Court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', 391 US 367 (1968).&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_e&quot;&gt;Walker, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen-year-old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in 1965 to object to the war, and was suspended from school. The ACLU appealed her case to the Supreme Court and won a victory in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]''. This critical case established that the government may not establish &quot;enclaves&quot; such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_e&quot; /&gt;

[[File:WCWProtest WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|left|The ACLU contends that the Bill of Rights protects individuals who burn the US flag as a form of expression]]
The ACLU defended Sydney Street, who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader [[James Meredith]]. In the ''[[Street v. New York]]'' decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was constitutionally protected form of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 280. Meredith, in fact, was not assassinated.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words &quot;fuck the draft&quot; on its back, while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Cohen v. California]]'', held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message.&lt;ref name=W281&gt;Walker, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-war related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', which held that only speech which advocated ''imminent'' violence could be outlawed.&lt;ref name=W281/&gt;

A major crisis gripped the ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted over whether to defend [[Benjamin Spock]] and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case.&lt;ref name=W2845&gt;Walker, pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Kent State shootings]] in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1968, the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing &quot;direct&quot; legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant), and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent).&lt;ref name=W285&gt;Walker, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLU's legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.&lt;ref name=W285/&gt;

==1970s and 1980s==

===Watergate era===
[[File:Richard M. Nixon, ca. 1935 - 1982 - NARA - 530679.jpg|thumb|The ACLU was the first national organization to call for the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]]]]

The ACLU supported ''[[The New York Times]]'' in its 1971 suit against the government, requesting permission to publish the [[Pentagon papers]]. The court upheld the ''Times'' and ACLU in the ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to wait until after it was published to take action.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 1973, the ACLU became first national organization to publicly call for the impeachment and removal from office of President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Jones| first=Glyn| title=ACLU Would Impeach Nixon| url=http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/collection/itempage.jsp?itemid=18506&amp;img=0&amp;level=advanced&amp;transcription=1| work=Greenfield Recorder| publisher=Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association| location=Deerfield, Massachusetts| date=November 10, 1973| accessdate=October 16, 2019| id=#L06.052| via=Online Collection – Memorial Hall Museum| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201015708/http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/collection/itempage.jsp?itemid=18506&amp;img=0&amp;level=advanced&amp;transcription=1| archive-date=December 1, 2019| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six civil liberties violations were cited as grounds: “specific proved violations of the rights of political dissent; usurpation of Congressional war‐making powers; establishment of a personal secret police which committed crimes; attempted interference in the trial of Daniel Ellsberg; distortion of the system of justice and perversion of other Federal agencies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=A.C.L.U.

===Enclaves and new civil liberties===
The decade from 1965 to 1975 saw an expansion of the field of civil liberties. Administratively, the ACLU responded by appointing [[Aryeh Neier]] to take over from Pemberton as Executive Director in 1970. Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU; he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds, and he created several new programs to focus the ACLU's legal efforts. By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 314–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run &quot;enclaves&quot;, new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 299. Key ACLU leaders in this effort were [[Ira Glasser]] and [[Aryeh Neier]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the organization grew substantially. The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs &quot;enclaves&quot;, which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control. Enclaves include mental hospital patients, members of the military, and prisoners, and students (while at school). The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice [[Abe Fortas]]'s use of the phrase &quot;schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism&quot; in the ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, James B. (2009), &quot;No Enclaves of Totalitarianism&quot;, American University Law Review, Vol. 58:1193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the ''Tinker v. Des Moines'' case, and expanded it with cases such as ''[[Goss v. Lopez]]'' which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments.&lt;ref name=W309&gt;Walker, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community.&lt;ref name=W309/&gt; In the landmark 1975 ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal.&lt;ref name=W309/&gt; The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended [[Billie Boggs]], a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Future Once Happened Here: New York, D.C., L.A., and the Fate of America's Big Cities|author=Siegel, F.|date=2013|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=9781594035555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l73QSrSIcwC|page=205|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Note, &quot;Beyond the Ken of Courts&quot;, ''Yale Law Journal'' 72 (1963):506. Cited by Walker, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material.&lt;ref name=W310&gt;Walker, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney [[Phil Hirschkop]] discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the [[Virginia State Penitentiary strike]], and won an important victory in 1971's ''[[Landman v. Royster]]'' which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 310–311. The ACLU was not involved in the ''Landman'' case.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the [[National Prison Project]]. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as ''[[Ruiz v. Estelle]]'' (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 [[United States Congress|US Congress]] enacted the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.

===Victim groups===
[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] co-founded the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Pullman, Sandra (March 7, 2006).

Accessed November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She was later appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by President [[Bill Clinton]].]]

The ACLU, during the 1960s and 1970s, expanded its scope to include what it referred to as &quot;victim groups&quot;, namely women, the poor, and [[homosexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Heeding the call of female members, the ACLU endorsed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;The ERA was passed by congress in 1972, but failed to be ratified by the states.&lt;/ref&gt; and created the Women's Rights Project in 1971. The Women's Rights Project dominated the legal field, handling more than twice as many cases as the [[National Organization for Women]], including breakthrough cases such as ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'', ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', and '' [[Taylor v. Louisiana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 304–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

ACLU leader [[Harriet Pilpel]] raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in 1964, and two years later the ACLU formally endorsed [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]. In 1972, ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher.  The US District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for &quot;immorality&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, and awarded monetary damages to the teacher.  The court refused to reinstate the teacher, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that refusal by a 2 to 1 vote. ''Burton v. Cascade School District'', 353 F. Supp. 254 (D. Or. 1972), aff'd 512 F.2d 850 (1975).  In 1973, the ACLU created the Sexual Privacy Project (later the Gay and Lesbian Rights Project) which combated discrimination against homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; This support continues even today. After then-Senator [[Larry Craig]] was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom, the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig, saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/freespeech/craig_v_minnesota_acluamicus.pdf State Of Minnesota]. (PDF). Retrieved on May 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rights of the poor was another area that was expanded by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals.&lt;ref name=W313&gt;Walker, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU played a key role in the 1968 ''[[King v. Smith]]'' decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.&lt;ref name=W313/&gt;

=== Reproductive Freedom Project ===
====History====

The Reproductive Freedom Project is an institution founded in 1974 (within the larger context of ACLU) that is committed to defend individuals who feel abused by the government, especially with cases pertaining to a lack of access to abortions, birth control, or sexual education.

====Mission====

The Reproductive Freedom Project of ACLU, according to their mission statement, actively works provide access to any and all reproductive health care for any human, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or political standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt32bqj0.7|title=The Other Feminists|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300074642|editor-last=HARTMANN|editor-first=SUSAN M.|series=Activists in the Liberal Establishment|pages=[https://archive.org/details/otherfeministsac0000hart/page/53 53–91]|url=https://archive.org/details/otherfeministsac0000hart/page/53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, Reproductive Freedom Programs fund ultrasounds and abortions and any lodging, meals, or transportation that go with that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abortionfunds.org/fund/richmond-reproductive-freedom-project/|title=Richmond Reproductive Freedom Project|work=National Network of Abortion Funds|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519152427/https://abortionfunds.org/fund/richmond-reproductive-freedom-project/|archive-date=May 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women have reported finding it necessary to cross state lines or wait weeks for an abortion, The Reproductive Freedom Project states that they want to fight for individuals &quot;state by state and law by law&quot; until every individual can pursue the kind of lifestyle they want.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-planned-parenthood-aclu-file-challenges-to-abortion-restrictions-in-three-states|title=Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood, ACLU File Challenges to Abortion Restrictions in Three States|date=2013-09-27|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709115230/https://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-planned-parenthood-aclu-file-challenges-to-abortion-restrictions-in-three-states|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on their website, &quot;states have enacted more restrictions to abortion than they did in the previous 10 years combined&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Accomplishments====
As referenced in the larger ACLU article, in 1929, the ACLU defended [[Margaret Sanger]]'s right to educate the general public about forms of birth control. In 1980, the Project filed ''Poe v. Lynchburg Training School'' after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated ''[[Walker v. Pierce]]'', the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent [[Medicaid]] patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981–1990, the Project litigated ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'', a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not to comply with a state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. In 1995, the Project filed ''[[Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth]]'', the US's first [[condom]] availability program.

====Current initiatives====

The Reproductive Freedom Project is presently working on three ideas: (1) to &quot;reverse the shortage of trained abortion providers throughout the country&quot; (2) to &quot;block state and federal welfare &quot;reform&quot; proposals that cut off benefits for children who are born to women already receiving welfare, unmarried women, or teenagers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=dejanikus|first=tacie|date=1982-01-01|title=spousal notification upheld in florida suit|jstor=25774248|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=12|issue=2|pages=9–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) to &quot;stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphia.pa.networkofcare.org/ps/services/agency.aspx?pid=ACLUofPAClaraBellDuvallReproductiveFreedomProject_1147_12_0|title=ACLU of PA: Clara Bell Duvall Reproductive Freedom Project – Philadelphia|website=Philadelphia.pa|access-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228161542/http://philadelphia.pa.networkofcare.org/ps/services/agency.aspx?pid=ACLUofPAClaraBellDuvallReproductiveFreedomProject_1147_12_0|archive-date=February 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project says they are hoping to achieve these goals through legal action and litigation.

===Privacy===
The [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] is not explicitly identified in the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]], but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'' case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt; The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion laws]] starting in 1964, a year before ''Griswold'' was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the [[Support for the legalization of abortion|right to abortion]] as a policy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU led the defense in ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'' which expanded the right of physicians to determine when [[abortion]]s were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 303. The ACLU did not participate directly in ''Roe v. Wade'', but did lead the effort in the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on [[interracial marriage]], in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967).

Related to privacy, the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]], which provided students the right to access their records; and the [[Privacy Act of 1974|1974 Privacy Act]] which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of bias===
In the early 1970s, conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar Joseph W. Bishop wrote that the ACLU's trend to partisanship started with its defense of Spock's anti-war protests.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Joseph W., &quot;Politics and the ACLU&quot;, ''Commentary'' 52 (December 1971): 50–58. Bishop cited by Walker. Bishop was professor of law at Yale.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace [[judicial activism]].&lt;ref name=W318&gt;Walker, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' violated the [[Original intent|intention of the authors]] of the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name=W318/&gt; The ACLU became an issue in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential campaign]], when Republican candidate [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]] accused Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] (a member of the ACLU) of being a &quot;card carrying member of the ACLU&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 319, 363. Bush quoted by Walker.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Skokie case===
{{main|National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie}}
It is the policy of the ACLU to support the civil liberties of defendants regardless of their ideological stance. The ACLU takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular viewpoints, such as [[George Wallace]], [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], and [[KKK]] members.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 323 (Rockwell); Walker p 242 (Wallace).&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a small group of American Nazis, led by [[Frank Collin]], applied to the town of [[Skokie, Illinois]], for permission to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of [[Nazi concentration camp]]s. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration.&lt;ref name=Skokie&gt;Walker, pp. 323–331.&lt;/ref&gt; Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court.&lt;ref name=Skokie/&gt; The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed in ''[[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie|Smith v. Collin]]'', 447 F.Supp. 676.&lt;ref&gt;Ed McManus, &quot;Nazi March: What's It All About?&quot;, ''Illinois Issues'', v.13, Nov. 1978 (available at [http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1978/ii781111.html Illinois Periodicals Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908083411/http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1978/ii781111.html |date=September 8, 2006 }}).&lt;br /&gt;The federal appeal case was ''Smith v. Collin'' 447 F.Supp. 676. See also Supreme Court: ''Smith v. Collin'', 439 US 916 (1978), and National Socialist Party v. Skokie, 432 US 43 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skokie case was heavily publicized across America, partially because Jewish groups such as the [[Jewish Defense League]] and [[Anti Defamation League]] strenuously objected to the demonstration, leading many members of the ACLU to cancel their memberships.&lt;ref name=Skokie/&gt; The Illinois affiliate of the ACLU lost about 25% of its membership and nearly one-third of its budget.&lt;ref&gt;30,000 ACLU members resigned in protest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Strum, ''When the Nazis Came to Skokie: Freedom for Speech We Hate'' (University Press of Kansas) ([http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/strwhe.html University of Kansas Press publisher's catalog description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827110841/http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/strwhe.html |date=August 27, 2007 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/skokiepo001&amp;CISOPTR=36|title=Membership woes hurt ACLU while others gain|access-date=October 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081913/http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=%2Fskokiepo001&amp;CISOPTR=36|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/skokiepo001&amp;CISOPTR=0|title=2d suit to block Nazis from Skokie march fails|access-date=October 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081811/http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=%2Fskokiepo001&amp;CISOPTR=0|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial strain from the controversy led to layoffs at local chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The High Cost of Free Speech: A.C.L.U. dilemma: defending &quot;hateful and heinous&quot; ideas |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 28, 1978 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916244-1,00.html |accessdate=May 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624045022/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C916244-1%2C00.html |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the membership crisis died down, the ACLU sent out a fund-raising appeal which explained their rationale for the Skokie case, and raised over $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1977}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reagan era===
[[File:Oliver North mug shot.jpg|thumb|upright|The ACLU defended [[Oliver North]] in 1990, arguing that his conviction was tainted by coerced testimony.]]

The [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|inauguration of Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1981, ushered in an [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|eight-year period of conservative leadership]] in the US government. Under [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s leadership, the government pushed a conservative social agenda.

Fifty years after the [[Scopes trial]], the ACLU found itself fighting another classroom case, the [[Arkansas]] 1981 creationism statute, which required schools to teach the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution. The ACLU won the case in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 342–343.&lt;br /&gt;''[[McLean v. Arkansas|McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]]'', 529 F. Supp. 1255 (E.D. Ark. 1982) ([http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html &quot;transcription&quot; by Clark Dorman], January 30, 1996, at TalkOrigins).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of [[child pornography]] (''[[New York v. Ferber]]''). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the [[three prong obscenity test]] should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/14793leg20020508.html|title=Letter to Reps.

During the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W.

In 1990, the ACLU defended Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver North]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU-UnpopularSpeech&quot; /&gt; whose conviction was tainted by coerced testimony{{spaced ndash}}a violation of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fifth amendment rights]]{{spaced ndash}}during the [[Iran–Contra affair]], where Oliver North was involved in illegal weapons sales to Iran in order to illegally fund the [[Contras|Contra guerillas]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 375.

===1990 to 2000===
[[File:Mount Soledad Cross WF.jpg|thumb|upright|A California affiliate of the ACLU sued to remove the [[Mount Soledad cross controversy|Mt. Soledad Cross]] from public lands in San Diego]]

In 1997, ruling unanimously in the case of ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'', the Supreme Court voted down anti-[[indecency]] provisions of the [[Communications Decency Act]] (the CDA), finding they violated the freedom of speech provisions of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the CDA's &quot;use of the undefined terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes/521bv.pdf |title=521 U.

In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, stated that proposed anti-[[Spamming|spam]] legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such, &quot;Standardized labeling is compelled speech.&quot; He also stated, &quot;It's relatively simple to click and delete.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adam S. Marlin, [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/06/09/amend.spam.idg/ &quot;First Amendment is obstacle to spam legislation&quot;], CNN, June 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate found the ACLU joining with the [[Direct Marketing Association (USA)|Direct Marketing Association]] and the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] in 2000 in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As early as 1997, the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported &quot;[[opt-out]]&quot; requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003|CAN-SPAM]] act&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/commercial/10953leg20030730.html &quot;Letter to the Senate Urging Opposition to S.877, the &quot;Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003&quot;&quot;], July 30, 2003 (last visited January 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it could have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on speech in cyberspace. It has been criticized for this position.

In November 2000, 15 African-American residents of [[Hearne, Texas]], were indicted on drug charges after being arrested in a series of &quot;drug sweeps&quot;. The ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit, ''[[Kelly v. Paschall]]'', on their behalf, alleging that the arrests were unlawful. The ACLU contended that 15 percent of Hearne's male African-American population aged 18 to 34 were arrested based only on the &quot;uncorroborated word of a single unreliable confidential informant coerced by police to make cases.&quot; On May 11, 2005, the ACLU and [[Robertson County, Texas|Robertson County]] announced a confidential settlement of the lawsuit, an outcome which &quot;both sides stated that they were satisfied with.&quot; The District Attorney dismissed the charges against the plaintiffs of the suit.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [https://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/racialjustice/10795prs20050602.html &quot;In Wake of ACLU Civil Rights Lawsuit Settlement, African Americans Affected by Texas Drug Task Force Scandal Call for Reconciliation at Town Meeting &quot;], June 2, 2005 (last visited April 10, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 film ''[[American Violet]]'' depicts this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/american-violet|title=American Violet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the ACLU's Massachusetts affiliate represented the [[North American Man Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA), on first amendment grounds, in the ''[[Curley v. NAMBLA]]'' wrongful death civil suit. The organization was sued because a man who raped and murdered a child had visited the NAMBLA website.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU-UnpopularSpeech&quot;&gt;ACLU, [https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11289prs20000831.html &quot;ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations&quot;], August 31, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, the ACLU lost the ''[[Boy Scouts of America v.

In March 2004, the ACLU, along with [[Lambda Legal]] and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], sued the state of California on behalf of six same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, ''Woo v. Lockyer'', was eventually consolidated into ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', the [[California Supreme Court]] case which led to same-sex marriage being available in that state from June 16, 2008, until [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] was passed on November 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/californiamarriage.html &quot;California Marriage Case&quot;], ACLU, retrieved June 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU, [[Lambda Legal]] and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] then challenged  [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/2008/11/06/californias-prop-8-update &quot;California's Prop 8 Update&quot;], ACLU, November 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and won.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclunc.org/news/press_releases/federal_appeals_court_says_california_marriage_ban_is_unconstitutional.shtml &quot;Federal Appeals Court Says California Marriage Ban Is Unconstitutional&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418065749/http://www.aclunc.org/news/press_releases/federal_appeals_court_says_california_marriage_ban_is_unconstitutional.shtml |date=April 18, 2012 }}, ACLU, February 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rush Limbaugh.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The ACLU submitted arguments supporting [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s right to privacy during the criminal investigation of his alleged drug use]]
During the 2004 trial regarding allegations of [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy should not have been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records.&lt;ref name=FOXRush&gt;Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (January 12, 2004), [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108140,00.html &quot;ACLU Comes to Rush Limbaugh's Defense&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115045416/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108140,00.html |date=January 15, 2013 }}, [[Fox News]]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, the [[Dover Area School District|school district]] in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of [[evolution]] is not fact and mentioning [[intelligent design]] as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The ACLU, joined by [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled in favor of the parents in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/education/21evolution.html &quot;Judge Rejects Teaching Intelligent Design&quot;], ''The New York Times'', December 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU sued the City of Los Angeles, on behalf of Robert Lee Purrie and five other homeless people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the US Constitution, and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting [[due process]] and [[equal protection]], and prohibiting [[cruel and unusual punishment]]). The Court ruled in favor of the ACLU, stating that, &quot;the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row.&quot; Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is &quot;one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States&quot;. Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:30&amp;nbsp;am. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not &quot;within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance&quot; and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise is the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/444/444.F3d.1118.04-55324.html |title=444 F.3d 1118 |publisher=Bulk.resource.org |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517210145/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/444/444.F3d.1118.04-55324.html |archivedate=May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/20/opinion/oe-westwater20|title=Handing skid row to the drug dealers|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 20, 2006|accessdate=August 15, 2012|first=Brady|last=Westwater}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for the first time in months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colorlines.com/archives/2007/10/lapd_gentrifies_skid_row.html|title=LAPD Gentrifies Skid Row|publisher=Colorlines|date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=August 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331010335/http://colorlines.com/archives/2007/10/lapd_gentrifies_skid_row.html|archive-date=March 31, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox |first=Margalit |url=http://articles.boston.com/keyword/skid-row |title=Articles about Skid Row |work=The Boston Globe |date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State joined with a pro-gun rights organization, the [[Second Amendment Foundation]], and prevailed in a lawsuit against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron's request.

After the [[September 11 attacks]], the federal government instituted a broad range of new measures to combat [[terrorism]], including the passage of the [[Patriot Act]]. The ACLU challenged many of the measures, claiming that they violated rights regarding [[due process]], privacy, illegal searches, and [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. An ACLU policy statement states:

{{quote|Our way forward lies in decisively turning our backs on the policies and practices that violate our greatest strength: our Constitution and the commitment it embodies to the rule of law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security.

The ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of 2001, the [[Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003|PATRIOT 2]] Act of 2003, and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism. In response to a requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act, the ACLU withdrew from the [[Combined Federal Campaign]] charity drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfc&quot;&gt;ACLU, [https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/18526prs20040731.html &quot;Citing Government &quot;Blacklist&quot;; Policy, ACLU Rejects $500,000 from Funding Program &quot;], July 31, 2004 (last visited January 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign imposed a requirement that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list. The ACLU has stated that it would &quot;reject $500,000 in contributions from private individuals rather than submit to a government 'blacklist' policy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cfc&quot; /&gt;

In 2004, the ACLU sued the federal government in ''[[American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft]]'' on behalf of [[Nicholas Merrill]], owner of an [[Internet service provider]]. Under the provisions of the Patriot Act, the government had issued [[national security letter]]s to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers.

The ACLU has also criticized [[targeted killing]]s of American citizens who fight against the United States.

Following [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]]'s election as President on November 8, 2016, the ACLU responded on Twitter saying: &quot;Should President-elect Donald Trump attempt to implement his unconstitutional campaign promises, we'll see him in court.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/796389278033051648|title=ACLU National on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] indefinitely barring &quot;Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, refugees or otherwise, from entering the United States for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/trump-refugee-ban-muslim-executive-order.html |title=Trump's Executive Order on Immigration: What We Know and What We Don't |last=Stack|first=Liam|date=2017-01-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU responded by filing a lawsuit against the ban on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who had been detained at JFK International Airport. On January 28, 2017, a US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly granted a temporary injunction against the immigration order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/aclu-and-other-groups-challenge-trump-immigration-ban-after-refugees-detained|title=ACLU and Other Groups Challenge Trump Immigration Ban After Refugees Detained at Airports Following Executive Order |department=Speak Freely (blog) |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying it was difficult to see any harm from allowing the newly arrived immigrants from entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-refugees-lawsuit-iraq-visas-234305|title=Judge blocks deportations as Trump order sparks global outrage|newspaper=POLITICO|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In response to Trump's order, the ACLU raised more than $24 million from more than 350,000 individual online donations in a two-day period. This amounted to six times what the ACLU normally receives in online donations in a year. Celebrities donating included [[Chris Sacca]] (who offered to match other people's donations and ultimately gave $150,000), [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Judd Apatow]], [[Sia Furler|Sia]], [[John Legend]], and [[Adele]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Stelter&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/30/news/aclu-online-donations/|title=ACLU racks up $24.1 million in donations over weekend|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=January 30, 2017 |publisher=CNNMoney|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/29/aclu-fundraising-records-muslim-immigrant-ban/97218098/|title=Outrage over Trump's immigrant ban helps ACLU raise more money online in one weekend than in all of 2016|newspaper=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of members of the ACLU doubled in the time from the election to end of January to 1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Grants and contributions increased from $106,628,381 [[USD]] reported by the 2016 year-end [[income statement]] to $274,104,575 by the 2017 year-end statement. The primary source of revenue from the segment came from individual contributions in response to the Trump presidency's alleged  infringements on [[civil liberty|civil liberties]]. The surge in donations more than doubled the total support and revenue of the [[non-profit organization]] year over year from 2016 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/aclu-annual-report-2017|title=ACLU ANNUAL REPORT 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides filing more lawsuits than during previous presidential administrations, the ACLU has spent more money on advertisements and messaging as well, weighing in on elections and pressing political concerns.  This increased public profile has drawn some accusations that the organization has become more politically partisan than in previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, Leslie (March 10, 2019).

[[CBS News]].  Retrieved October 9, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]]'s arrest, [[Ben Wizner]] from the ACLU said that if authorities were to prosecute Assange &quot;for violating U.S. secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Julian Assange's arrest draws fierce international reaction |url=https://www.foxnews.com/world/wikileaks-julian-assange-arrest-international-reaction |publisher=Fox News |date=April 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting of Jocques Clemmons===
The ACLU of Tennessee protested the [[shooting of Jocques Clemmons]] which occurred in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on February 10, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetennesseanclemmonsfamily&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sawyer|first1=Ariana|last2=Tamburin|first2=Adam|last3=Wadhwani|first3=Anita|title=Jocques Clemmons' family, community leaders call for officer's firing|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/05/11/community-reaction-no-prosecution-nashville-officer-involved-shooting/318462001/|accessdate=May 14, 2017|work=The Tennessean|date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2017, as Glenn Funk, the district attorney of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], decided not to prosecute police officer Joshua Lippert, they called for an independent community review board and for Nashville police officers to wear body cameras, which was approved by local voters in a referendum.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetennesseanclemmonsfamily&quot;/&gt;

===Free speech ===
On June 21, 2018, a leaked memo showed that the ACLU has explicitly endorsed the view that [[free speech]] can harm marginalized groups by undermining their civil rights. &quot;Speech that denigrates such groups can inflict serious harms and is intended to and often will impede progress toward equality,&quot; the ACLU declared in guidelines governing case selection and &quot;Conflicts Between Competing Values or Priorities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminer&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-aclu-retreats-from-free-expression-1529533065|title=The ACLU Retreats From Free Expression|last=Kaminer|first=Wendy|date=2018-06-20|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU had previously defended the free speech rights of the KKK and Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/freedom-expression-aclu-position-paper|title=Freedom of Expression - ACLU Position Paper|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acluohio.org/archives/cases/brandenburg-v-ohio|title=Brandenburg v.

The ACLU argued that a Massachusetts law, later unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court, was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/cases/mccullen-v-coakley|title=McCullen v. Coakley|last=September 18|last2=2013|website=American Civil Liberties Union|language=en|access-date=2019-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law prohibited sidewalk counselors from approaching women outside abortion facilities and offering them alternatives to abortion but allowed escorts to speak with them and accompany them into the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/12-1168  McCULLEN v. COAKLEy]&lt;/ref&gt;  In overturning the law in [[McCullen v. Coakley]], the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that it violated the counselors' freedom of speech and that it was viewpoint discrimination.
