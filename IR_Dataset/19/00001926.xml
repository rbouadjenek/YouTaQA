'''Antlia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|t|l|i|ə}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀντλία'') is a [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]]. Its name means &quot;[[pump]]&quot; in [[Latin]]; it represents an [[air pump]]. Originally '''Antlia Pneumatica''', the constellation was established by [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in the 18th century, though its name was later abbreviated by [[John Herschel]]. Located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship [[Argo Navis]], Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of [[49th parallel north|49 degrees north]].

Antlia is a faint constellation; its brightest star is [[Alpha Antliae]], an orange [[giant star|giant]] that is a suspected [[variable star]], ranging between [[apparent magnitude]]s 4.22 and 4.29. [[S Antliae]] is an [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary]] star system, changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other. Sharing a [[common envelope]], the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, [[HD 93083]] and [[WASP-66]], lie within Antlia, as do [[NGC 2997]], a [[spiral galaxy]], and the [[Antlia Dwarf|Antlia Dwarf Galaxy]].

==History==
[[File:Antlia bode.JPG|thumb|border|upright=1.38|left|Johann Bode's depiction of Antlia as a double-cylinder air pump]]
The French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] first described the constellation in French as ''la Machine Pneumatique'' (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52,&lt;ref name=ridpathlac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |title=Lacaille's Southern Planisphere of 1756 |work=Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath |publisher=Self-published |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lacaille, Nicolas Louis |date=1756 |title=Relation abrégée du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-espérance |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |pages=519–592 [589] |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f787 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commemorating the [[air pump]] invented by the French physicist [[Denis Papin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work= Star Tales |title= Antlia |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm |accessdate=3 December 2007| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]] not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{efn|1=The exception is [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]], named for the [[Table Mountain]]. The other thirteen (alongside Antlia) are [[Caelum]], [[Circinus]], [[Fornax]], [[Horologium (constellation)|Horologium]], [[Microscopium]], [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]], [[Octans]], [[Pictor]], [[Pyxis]], [[Reticulum]], [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] and [[Telescopium]].{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=5–6}} }}{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=5–6}} Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] chose the more advanced double-cylinder version.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; Lacaille [[Latin]]ised the name to ''Antlia pneumatica'' on his 1763 chart. English astronomer [[John Herschel]] proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Herschel, John | year=1844 | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=60–62 | title=Farther Remarks on the Division of Southern Constellations | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=s-tBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA62 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/6.5.60a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was universally adopted.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=25}} The [[International Astronomical Union]] adopted it as one of the [[88 modern constellations]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;/&gt;

Although visible to the [[Ancient Greek astronomy|Ancient Greeks]], Antlia's stars were too faint to have been included in any ancient constellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation [[Argo Navis]], the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Birren, Peter | year= 2002|title= Objects in the Heavens|pages= 9, 45 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn= 978-1-55369-662-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webb, Thomas William |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York, New York |date=1962 |title=Celestial objects for common telescopes |volume=2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/celestialobjects00webb/page/36 36] |isbn=978-0-486-20918-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/celestialobjects00webb/page/36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ridpath, Ian |year=2002|title= Stars and Planets|pages= 65, 122 | publisher=Smithsonian Handbooks | location=New York, New York |isbn= 978-0-7894-8988-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In non-Western astronomy===
[[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] were able to view what is modern Antlia from their latitudes, and incorporated its stars into two different constellations. Several stars in the southern part of Antlia were a portion of &quot;''Dong'ou''&quot;, which represented an area in southern China.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, [[Epsilon Antliae|Epsilon]], [[Eta Antliae|Eta]], and [[Theta Antliae]] were incorporated into the celestial temple, which also contained stars from modern [[Pyxis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Covering 238.9 square degrees and hence 0.579% of the sky, Antlia ranks 62nd of the [[88 modern constellations]] by area.&lt;ref name=tirionconst&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its position in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]] means that the whole [[constellation]] is visible to observers south of [[49th parallel north|49°N]].&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;{{efn|1=Although parts of the constellation technically rise above the horizon to observers between the 49°N and [[65th parallel north|65°N]], stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;}} [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the sea snake runs along the length of its northern border, while [[Pyxis]] the compass, [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] the sails, and [[Centaurus]] the centaur line it to the west, south and east respectively.

Lacaille gave nine stars [[Bayer designation]]s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, combining two stars next to each other as Zeta. Gould later added a tenth, [[Iota Antliae]]. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now [[HR 4339]] and [[HD 90156]]) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=29}} Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to [[apparent magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;6.5.{{efn|1=Objects of magnitude 6.5 are among the faintest visible to the unaided eye in suburban-rural transition night skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|last=Bortle|first=John E.|date=February 2001|work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;
