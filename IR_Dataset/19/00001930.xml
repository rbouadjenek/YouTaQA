Arkansas is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|29th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|33rd most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. The capital and most populous city is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], located in the central portion of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, such as the [[Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area]] and [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]], is a population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the state's eastern part is [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]]. The largest city in the state's southeastern part is [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]].

The [[Territory of Arkansas]] was [[admitted to the Union]] as the 25th state on June 15, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cash |first= Marie |title= Arkansas Achieves Statehood |journal= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 2 | date= December 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Delta had been developed for cotton plantations, and the state landowners largely depended on [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] as workers. In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

On returning to the Union in 1868, the state continued to suffer due to its reliance on the large-scale [[plantation economy]]. Cotton continued as the leading commodity crop, although the cotton market declined. Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment, the state fell behind in terms of its economy and opportunities for residents.

[[White American|White]] rural interests dominated the state's politics by disenfranchisement of African Americans and by refusal to reapportion the legislature. It was not until after the [[civil rights movement]] and federal intervention that more African Americans were able to vote. The Supreme Court overturned rural domination in the South and other states that had refused to reapportion their state legislatures, or retained rules based on geographic districts. In the landmark ruling of ''[[one man, one vote]]'', it ruled that states had to organize both houses of their legislatures by districts that held approximately equal populations, and that these had to be redefined as necessary after each decade's census.

Following [[World War II]], Arkansas began to diversity its economy. In the 21st century, its economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, [[soybeans]] and [[rice]].

The [[culture of Arkansas]] is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state. Notable people from the state include politician and educational advocate [[William Fulbright]]; former president [[Bill Clinton]], who also served as the 40th and 42nd governor of Arkansas; general [[Wesley Clark]], former [[NATO]] [[Supreme Allied Commander]]; [[Walmart]] founder and magnate [[Sam Walton]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Parker |first= Suzy |title= Arkansas's hillbilly image persists into 21st century |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/us-hillbilly-arkansas-idUSTRE78O2UT20110925 |location= Little Rock, AR |date= September 25, 2011 |work = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; singer-songwriters [[Johnny Cash]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[Jimmy Driftwood]], and [[Glen Campbell]]; actor-filmmaker, [[Billy Bob Thornton]]; poet [[Carolyn D.

==Etymology and pronunciation==

[[File:Arkansas WikiProject.png|thumb|[[File:En-us-Arkansas.ogg]] &lt;br /&gt; Pronunciation of Arkansas]]

The name ''Arkansas'' was initially applied to the [[Arkansas River]]. It derives from a [[French language|French]] term, ''Arcansas'', their plural term for their transliteration of ''akansa'', an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] term for the [[Quapaw]] people.&lt;ref name=&quot;bright&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bright|first1=William|title=Native American Placenames of the United States|date=2007|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=978-0-806135984|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=Akancea%2C%20Acansea%2C%20Acansa%20(Dickinson%2C%201995)&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q=Akancea,%20Acansea&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were a [[Dhegiha Siouan]]-speaking people who settled in Arkansas around the 13th century. ''akansa'' is likely also the root term for [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name=bright/&gt;

The name has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot;/&gt; In 1881, the state legislature defined the official pronunciation of Arkansas as having the final &quot;s&quot; be silent (as it would be in French). A dispute had arisen between the state's two senators over the pronunciation issue. One favored pronunciation as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}} {{respell|AR|kən|saw}} while the other favored {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}} {{respell|ar|KAN|zəs}}.{{Refn | name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; | group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot; |

The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}}, {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}}, and several other variants. The residents of Arkansas have called themselves either &quot;Arkansans&quot; or &quot;Arkansawyers&quot;. In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution, now Arkansas Code 1 April 105:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm |format=official text |title=Code |place=AR, [[United States|US]] |publisher=Assembly |issue=1‐4‐105 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924223556/http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.

And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.

Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;man&quot; and the sounding of the terminal &quot;s&quot; is discouraged by Arkansans.}} Despite this, the state's name is still frequently mispronounced, especially by non-Americans; in fact, it is spelled in [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] with the {{respell|ar|KAN|zəs}} pronunciation.

Citizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.}}

In 2007, the state legislature passed a non-binding resolution declaring that the possessive form of the state's name is ''Arkansas's'', which has been followed increasingly by the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Gambrell |first= John |url= http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/mar/13/senate-gives-support-possessive-form-arkansas/ |title= Senate gives support to possessive form of Arkansas |publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]] |date= March 13, 2007 |accessdate= June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries===

Arkansas borders [[Louisiana]] to the south, [[Texas]] to the southwest, [[Oklahoma]] to the west, [[Missouri]] to the north, and [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]] to the east. The [[United States Census Bureau]] classifies Arkansas as a [[Southern United States|southern]] state, sub-categorized among the [[West South Central States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wsc&quot; /&gt; The [[Mississippi River]] forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in [[Clay County, Arkansas|Clay]] and [[Greene County, Arkansas|Greene]], counties where the [[St. Francis River]] forms the western boundary of the [[Missouri Bootheel]], and in many places where the channel of the Mississippi has meandered (or been straightened by man) from its original 1836 course.

===Terrain===

Arkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest half and the lowlands of the southeastern half.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The highlands are part of the Southern Interior Highlands, including [[The Ozarks]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. The southern lowlands include the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] and the [[Arkansas Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; This dual split can yield to general regions named northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, or central Arkansas. These directionally named regions are broad and not defined along county lines. Arkansas has seven distinct natural regions: the Ozark Mountains, Ouachita Mountains, [[Arkansas River Valley]], Gulf Coastal Plain, [[Crowley's Ridge]], and the Arkansas Delta, with [[Central Arkansas]] sometimes included as a blend of multiple regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arkansas Regions |url=http://www.arkansasheritage.com/discover/natural_environments/regions.aspx |website=Discover Arkansas History |publisher=The Department of Arkansas Heritage |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614023536/http://www.arkansasheritage.com/discover/natural_environments/regions.aspx |archivedate=June 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southeastern part of Arkansas along the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] is sometimes called the Arkansas Delta. This region is a flat landscape of [[River delta|rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding]] of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas. The Delta region is bisected by a geological formation known as [[Crowley's Ridge]]. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from {{convert|250|to|500|ft|m}} above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northwest Arkansas is part of the [[Ozark Plateau]] including the [[Ozark Mountains]], to the south are the [[Ouachita Mountains]], and these regions are divided by the [[Arkansas River]]; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These mountain ranges are part of the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]] region, the only major mountainous region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Ozark Mountains |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437144/Ozark-Mountains |accessdate= January 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in the state is [[Mount Magazine]] in the [[Ouachita Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Arkansas's Highpoint Information |url= http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/!userfiles/pdfs/MM%20Highpoint%20bro%2005.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= [[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism]] |accessdate= January 2, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130306172243/http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/!userfiles/pdfs/MM%20Highpoint%20bro%2005.pdf |archive-date= March 6, 2013 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which rises to {{convert|2753|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Buffalo National River.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Buffalo National River]] is one of many attractions that give the state its nickname, ''The Natural State''.]]

Arkansas has many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs within or along its borders. Major tributaries of the Mississippi River include the [[Arkansas River]], the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]], and the [[St. Francis River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Writers 1987, p. 8&quot;&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arkansas is fed by the [[Mulberry River (Arkansas)|Mulberry River]] and the [[Fourche La Fave River|Fourche LaFave River]] in the Arkansas River Valley, which is also home to [[Lake Dardanelle]]. The [[Buffalo National River|Buffalo River]], [[Little Red River (Arkansas)|Little Red River]], [[Black River (Arkansas)|Black River]] and [[Cache River (Arkansas)|Cache River]] all serve as tributaries to the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]], which also empties into the Mississippi. The [[Saline River (Ouachita River)|Saline River]], [[Little Missouri River (Arkansas)|Little Missouri River]], [[Bayou Bartholomew]], and the [[Caddo River]] all serve as tributaries to the [[Ouachita River]] in south Arkansas, [[Old River Control Structure|which eventually empties into the Mississippi]] in Louisiana. The [[Red River of the South|Red River]] briefly serves as the state's boundary with Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas has few natural lakes and many reservoirs, {{Quantify|date=August 2016}} such as [[Bull Shoals Lake]], [[Lake Ouachita]], [[Greers Ferry Lake]], [[Millwood Lake]], [[Beaver Lake (Arkansas)|Beaver Lake]], [[Norfork Lake]], [[DeGray Lake]], and [[Lake Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas is home to many [[List of caves in Arkansas|caves]], such as [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]]. More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters, have been cataloged by the State Archeologist.

Arkansas is divided into three broad ecoregions, the ''Ozark, Ouachita-Appalachian Forests'', ''Mississippi Alluvial and Southeast USA Coastal Plains'', and the ''Southeastern USA Plains''and two biomes, the subtropical coniferous forest and the temperate deciduous forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title= Ecological Regions of North America |scale= 1:10000000 |url= ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/cec_na/NA_LEVEL_II.pdf |type = PDF |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate= July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state is further divided into seven subregions: the Arkansas Valley, [[Boston Mountains]], [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]], [[Crowley's Ridge|Mississippi Valley Loess Plain]], Ozark Highlands, Ouachita Mountains, and the South Central Plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title= Ecoregions of Arkansas |url= ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/ar/ar_eco_pg.pdf |type = PDF |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate= July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 [[United States Forest Service]] survey determined {{convert|18720000|acre|ha}} of Arkansas's land is forestland, or 56% of the state's total area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Forest Inventory and Analysis |url= http://srsfia2.fs.fed.us/states/ar/tables/AR_2010-FS_FIADB_22JUNE2011.xls |format= XLS |year= 2010 |publisher= United States Forest Service, Southern Research Station |accessdate= July 5, 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121201151653/http://srsfia2.fs.fed.us/states/ar/tables/AR_2010-FS_FIADB_22JUNE2011.xls |archivedate= December 1, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant species in Arkansas's forests include ''[[Oak|Quercus]]'' (oak), ''[[Hickory|Carya]]'' (hickory), ''[[Pinus echinata]]'' (shortleaf pine) and ''[[Pinus taeda]]'' (loblolly pine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Proceedings of the Symposium on Arkansas Forests: A Conference on the Results of the Recent Forest Survey of Arkansas |url=http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/2793 |publisher= [[United States Forest Service]] |date= May 30–31, 1997 |page= 74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Dale, Jr |first1= Edward E. |last2= Ware |first2= Stewart |title= Distribution of Wetland Tree Species in Relation to a Flooding Gradient and Backwater versus Streamside Location in Arkansas, U.S.A |date= April–June 2004 |journal= Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society |volume= 131 |pages= 177–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas's plant life varies with its climate and elevation. The [[Arkansas Timberlands|pine belt]] stretching from the Arkansas delta to Texas consists of dense oak-hickory-pine growth. Lumbering and paper milling activity is active throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Arkansas, one can find ''[[Taxodium]] '' (cypress), ''[[Quercus nigra]]'' (water oaks), and hickories with their roots submerged in the Mississippi Valley bayous indicative of the deep south.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby Crowley's Ridge is the only home of the [[Liriodendron|tulip tree]] in the state, and generally hosts more northeastern plant life such as the [[beech]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The northwestern highlands are covered in an oak-hickory mixture, with [[Juniperus ashei|Ozark white cedars]], ''[[Cornus (genus)|cornus]]'' (dogwoods), and ''[[Cercis canadensis]]'' (redbuds) also present. The higher peaks in the Arkansas River Valley play host to scores of ferns, including the ''[[Woodsia scopulina]]'' and ''[[Adiantum]]'' (maidenhair fern) on Mount Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas generally has a [[humid subtropical climate]]. While not bordering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas has hot, humid summers and slightly drier, mild to cool winters. In [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], the daily high temperatures average around {{convert|93|°F|°C|abbr=on}} with lows around {{convert|73|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in July. In January highs average around {{convert|51|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and lows around {{convert|32|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. In [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are {{convert|89|and|67|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and in January the average high and low are {{convert|44|and|23|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about {{convert|40|and|60|in|mm}}; somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Climate in Arkansas |url= http://www.city-data.com/states/Arkansas-Climate.html |publisher= City-data |accessdate= January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is infrequent but most common in the northern half of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Writers 1987, p. 8&quot;/&gt; The half of the state south of Little Rock is more apt to see ice storms. Arkansas's all-time record high is {{convert|120|F|C}} at [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]] on August 10, 1936; the all-time record low is {{convert|−29|F|C}} at [[Gravette, Arkansas|Gravette]], on February 13, 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= State Climate Records |url= http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records |date= July 23, 2012 |publisher= National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center |website= State Climate Extremes Committee |accessdate= January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas is known for extreme weather and frequent storms. A typical year brings thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in [[Tornado Alley]], and as a result, a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While sufficiently far from the coast to avoid a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]], which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.

[[File:Chromesun toltec mounds photo01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Platform mound]]s, such as this one at [[Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park|Toltec Mounds]] near [[Scott, Arkansas|Scott]], were constructed frequently during the [[Woodland Period|Woodland]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian periods]]]]

Before European settlement of North America, Arkansas was inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, ''[[Quigualtam]]''. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas]], in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed &quot;four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs&quot; which were auctioned off. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former [[aide-de-camp]] Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.&lt;ref name=HUDSONKNIGHTS&gt;{{cite book| authorlink =Charles M.

Later explorers included the French [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] in 1673, and Frenchmen [[Robert La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] in 1681.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Sabo III |first= George |title= First Encounters, Hernando de Soto in the Mississippi Valley, 1541–42 |url=http://arkarcheology.uark.edu/indiansofarkansas/index.html?pageName=First%20Encounters |date= December 12, 2008 |accessdate= May 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Tonti established [[Arkansas Post]] at a Quapaw village in 1686, making it the first European settlement in the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;Arnold 1992, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the [[Illinois language|Illinois]] tribe's name for the [[Quapaw]] people, who lived downriver from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=7800 |title=Linguist list 14.4 |publisher=Listserv.linguistlist.org |date=February 11, 2003 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208035440/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=7800 |archivedate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot;/&gt; The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}}, {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either &quot;Arkansans&quot; or &quot;Arkansawyers&quot;. In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (official text):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;man&quot; and the sounding of the terminal &quot;s&quot; is an innovation to be discouraged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Citizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s|_|ˈ|r|ɪ|v|ər}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.

Settlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century. These people used Arkansas Post as a home base and [[entrepôt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot; /&gt; During the colonial period, Arkansas changed hands between [[France]] and [[Spain]] following the [[Seven Years' War]], although neither showed interest in the remote settlement of Arkansas Post.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]], a brief [[Battle of Arkansas Post (American Revolutionary War)|siege]] of the post by British Captain James Colbert with the assistance of the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Din |first= Gilbert C. |title= Arkansas Post in the American Revolution |journal= The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |date= Spring 1981 |volume= 40 |pages= 17–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] to the United States in 1803, including all of Arkansas, in a transaction known today as the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. French soldiers remained as a garrison at [[Arkansas Post]]. Following the purchase, the balanced give-and-take relationship between settlers and Native Americans began to change all along the frontier, including in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Missouri compromise|a controversy over allowing slavery in the territory]], the [[Territory of Arkansas]] was organized on July 4, 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot; /&gt; Gradual emancipation in Arkansas was struck down by one vote, the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]], allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1965, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery in the United States|Slavery]] became a wedge issue in Arkansas, forming a geographic divide that remained for decades. Owners and operators of the cotton [[plantation economy]] in southeast Arkansas firmly supported slavery, as they perceived [[Slavery|slave labor]] as the best or &quot;only&quot; economically viable method of harvesting their commodity crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bolton |first= S. Charles |title= Slavery and the Defining of Arkansas |journal= The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |date= Spring 1999 |volume= 58 |page= 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;hill country&quot; of northwest Arkansas was unable to grow cotton and relied on a cash-scarce, [[subsistence farming]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs 1961, pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:United States 1836-06-1836-07.png|thumb|Map of the states and territories of the United States as it was from June 1836 to July 1836. On June 15, 1836, Arkansas Territory was admitted as the state of Arkansas.]]

As European Americans settled throughout the East Coast and into the Midwest, in the 1830s the United States government forced the [[Indian Removal|removal]] of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes to Arkansas and [[Indian Territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Additional Native American removals began in earnest during the territorial period, with final Quapaw removal complete by 1833 as they were pushed into Indian Territory.&lt;ref&gt;White 1962, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was relocated from Arkansas Post to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] in 1821, during the territorial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Territorial Governors of Arkansas |last= Eno |first= Clara B. |journal= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |date= Winter 1945 |volume= 4 |page= 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statehood===

{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}

When Arkansas applied for statehood, the slavery issue was again raised in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Congress eventually approved the [[Arkansas Constitution]] after a 25-hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836, as the 25th state and the 13th [[slave state]], having a population of about 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs 1961, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas struggled with taxation to support its new state government, a problem made worse by [[Holford Bonds|a state banking scandal]] and worse yet by the [[Panic of 1837]].

===Civil War and Reconstruction===

{{Main|Ordinance of Secession|Confederate States of America|Arkansas in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Lakeport Plantation, Lake Village, Chicot County, Arkansas.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lakeport Plantation]], c. 1859 and built south of [[Lake Village, Arkansas|Lake Village]], is the only remaining antebellum [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] on the Mississippi River in Arkansas. Many planters became wealthy from the [[cotton]] industry in southern Arkansas.]]

In early antebellum Arkansas, the southeast Arkansas slave-based economy developed rapidly. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}. Retrieved March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantation agriculture set the state and region behind the nation for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth developed among planters of southeast Arkansas caused a political rift to form between the northwest and southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;bol&quot;&gt;Bolton 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many politicians were elected to office from [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|the Family]], the Southern rights political force in antebellum Arkansas. Residents generally wanted to avoid a civil war. When the Gulf states seceded in early 1861, Arkansas voted to remain in the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;bol&quot; /&gt; Arkansas did not secede until [[Abraham Lincoln]] demanded Arkansas troops be sent to [[Fort Sumter]] to quell [[Battle of Fort Sumter|the rebellion there]]. On May 6, a state convention voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bol&quot; /&gt;

Arkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the [[Mississippi River]] and surrounding Southern states. The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union general [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863 to 1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, [[guerrilla]] warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.

Under the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the [[Radical Republicans]] and Unionists, and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]], they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.

===End of the Reconstruction===

In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War—Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091926/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified, re-enfranchising former Confederates.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more [[immigrants]] and [[migrant worker|migrants]]. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Baker, ''[http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Minority_Settlement.pdf Minority Settlement in the Mississippi River Counties of the Arkansas Delta, 1870–1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527190216/http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Minority_Settlement.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }}'', Arkansas Preservation Commission. Retrieved May 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early 20th-century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property.

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].

===Rise of the Jim Crow laws===

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time, more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to enforce constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&amp;issue_id=36&amp;page=3 &quot;White Primary&quot; System Bars Blacks from Politics—1900, ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3.

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small immigration of [[Germans|German]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and Scots-Irish from Europe. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from [[Ulster]], of Scots and Northern Borders descent.

Based on the order of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] given shortly after [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], nearly 16,000 [[Japanese Americans]] were forcibly removed from the [[West Coast of the United States]] and incarcerated in two internment camp located in the [[Arkansas Delta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2273|title=Japanese American Relocation Camps—Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=encyclopediaofarkansas.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rohwer War Relocation Center|Rohwer Camp]] in [[Desha County]] operated from September 1942 to November 1945 and at its peak interned 8,475 prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; The [[Jerome War Relocation Center]] in [[Drew County]] operated from October 1942 to June 1944 and held c. 8,000 prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

===Fall of segregation===

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] in 1954 that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional, some students worked to integrate schools in the state. The [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention in 1957 when the Federal government had to intervene to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] had ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine—Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115012/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=723 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prominent American figures from Arkansas===

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Arkansas was 3,017,804 on July 1, 2019, a 3.49% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AnnualEstUS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2019/state/totals/nst-est2019-01.xlsx?# |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 |format= |website=2010-2019 Population Estimates |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division |date=December 30, 2019 |accessdate=January 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2019, Arkansas has an estimated population of 3,017,804.&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEstUS&quot;/&gt; From fewer than 15,000 in 1820, Arkansas's population grew to 52,240 during a special census in 1835, far exceeding the 40,000 required to apply for statehood.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Following statehood in 1836, the population doubled each decade until the [[1870 United States Census|1870 Census]] conducted following the Civil War. The state recorded growth in each successive decade, although it gradually slowed in the 20th century.

It recorded population losses in the [[1950 United States Census|1950]] and [[1960 United States Census|1960 Censuses]]. This outmigration was a result of multiple factors, including farm mechanization, decreasing labor demand, and young educated people leaving the state due to a lack of non-farming industry in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Holley |first= Donald |title= Leaving the Land of Opportunity: Arkansas and the Great Migration |journal= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 64 |pages= 247–248 |date= Autumn 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas again began to grow, recording positive growth rates ever since and exceeding the two-million mark during the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resident Population Data |publisher=United States Census Bureau |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |accessdate=July 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220045933/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archivedate=December 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas's rate of change, age distributions, and gender distributions mirror national averages.

European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern [[Ozarks]] and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]], Protestants from [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] before the American Revolution. [[English American|English]] and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of [[English American|English]] stock are found throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.633–639&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the people identifying as American are of English descent and/or Scots-Irish descent. Their families have been in the state so long, in many cases since before statehood, that they choose to identify simply as having American ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry. Many people who identify themselves as Irish descent are in fact of Scots-Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas's population (over the age of five) spoke only English at home. About 4.5% of the state's population spoke Spanish at home. About 0.7% of the state's population spoke any other [[Indo-European language]]s. About 0.8% of the state's population spoke an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]], and 0.2% spoke other languages.{{clarify|post-text=dubious|reason=At least a quarter of the Indo-European languages are in Asia|date=March 2017}}

===Religion===

Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the [[Bible Belt]] and is predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] with 661,382; the [[United Methodist Church]] with 158,574; non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 129,638; the [[Catholic Church]] with 122,662; and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] with 31,254. There are some residents of the state who live by other religions such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Wicca]], [[Paganism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] or who claim no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/05/rcms2010_05_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &amp;#124; State membership Report |publisher=Thearda.com |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry and commerce===

Arkansas's earliest industries were [[fur trading]] and agriculture, with development of cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] in the areas near the Mississippi River. They were dependent on slave labor through the [[American Civil War]].

Today only about three percent of the population are employed in the agricultural sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Selected Economic Characteristics 2006–2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates |publisher= United States Census Bureau |url= http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_5YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table |year= 2011 |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking 13th in the nation in the value of products sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;agcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |website= Census of Agriculture |title= Arkansas State Profile |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |url= http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/County_Profiles/Arkansas/cp99005.pdf |year= 2007 |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas is the nation's largest producer of rice, [[broiler]]s, and turkeys,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ''Poultry—Production and Value, 2010 Summary'', data indicates Arkansas led the nation in 2008, 2009, and 2010, in both broilers and turkeys.&lt;/ref&gt; and ranks in the top three for [[cotton]], [[pullets]], and aquaculture (catfish).&lt;ref name=&quot;agcensus&quot; /&gt; Forestry remains strong in the [[Arkansas Timberlands]], and the state ranks fourth nationally and first in the South in softwood lumber production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Matthew H. |last= Pelkki |title= An Economic Assessment of Arkansas's Forest Industries: Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st Century |publisher= University of Arkansas-Monticello School of Forest Resources, Arkansas Forest Resources Center, University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture |url= http://arkansasagnews.uark.edu/afrc-007.2.1-20.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= October 4, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120928163327/http://arkansasagnews.uark.edu/afrc-007.2.1-20.pdf |archive-date= September 28, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automobile parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states.

Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname &quot;The Natural State&quot; was created for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still used to this day. The state maintains [[List of Arkansas state parks|52 state parks]] and the [[National Park Service]] maintains seven properties in Arkansas. The completion of the [[William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library]] in Little Rock has drawn many visitors to the city and revitalized the nearby [[Little Rock River Market District|River Market District]]. Many cities also hold festivals, which draw tourists to Arkansas culture, such as The Bradley County Pink Tomato Festival in Warren, [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]], [[Ozark Folk Center|Ozark Folk Festival]], [[Toad Suck Daze]], and [[Tontitown, Arkansas|Tontitown Grape Festival]].

The culture of Arkansas includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Sports are also very important to the culture of Arkansas, ranging from football, baseball, and basketball to hunting and fishing. Perhaps the best-known piece of Arkansas's culture is the stereotype of its citizens as shiftless hillbillies.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation began when the state was characterized by early explorers as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The most enduring icon of Arkansas's hillbilly reputation is ''[[Edward Washburn|The Arkansas Traveller]]'', a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins 2009, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherlin 1996, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the [[Little Rock Nine]] adding to Arkansas's enduring image.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherlin 1996, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy.

Festivals such as the [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]] and [[Bikes, Blues, and BBQ]] pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The Ozark Folk Festival in [[Mountain View, Arkansas|Mountain View]] is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' by [[Maya Angelou]] and ''[[A Painted House]]'' by [[John Grisham]] describe the culture at various time periods.

===Sports and recreation===

Sports have become an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in and spectating various events throughout the year.

Team sports and especially collegiate football have been important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings. The [[University of Arkansas]] first fielded a team in [[1894 Arkansas Cardinals football team|1894]] when football was a very dangerous game. Recent studies of the damage to team members from the concussions common in football make it clear that the danger persists.

&quot;[[Calling the Hogs]]&quot; is a cheer that shows support for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks|Razorbacks]], one of the two [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) teams in the state. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of the state. Although the University of Arkansas is based in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], the Razorbacks have always played at least one game per season at [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas.

[[Arkansas State University]] joined the University of Arkansas in FBS (then known as Division I-A) in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas's policy of not playing intrastate games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other campuses of the [[University of Arkansas System]] are Division I members. The [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] is a member of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]], a league whose members all play football in the second-level [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). The [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] is a member of the FBS [[Sun Belt Conference]], but is one of two conference schools that have [[List of NCAA Division I non-football programs|no football program]]. The state's other Division{{nbsp}}I member is the [[University of Central Arkansas]], which is a full member (including football) of the FCS [[Southland Conference]].

Seven of Arkansas's smaller colleges play in [[NCAA Division II]], with six in the [[Great American Conference]] and one in the [[Lone Star Conference]]. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in [[NCAA Division III]], in which [[athletic scholarship]]s are prohibited.

Baseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886 to the 1920s. Two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey–Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in the [[Texas League]].

Related to the state's frontier past, hunting continues in the state. The state created the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in 1915 to regulate hunting and enforce those regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Griffee |first= Carol |title= Odyssey of Survival, A History of the Arkansas Conservation Sales Tax |page= 10 |url= http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= September 16, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082707/http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |archive-date= January 17, 2013 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting [[duck]] in the [[Mississippi flyway]] and [[deer]] across the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutherlin 1996, p. 164&quot;&gt;Sutherlin 1996, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutherlin 1996, p. 164&quot;/&gt;

Fishing has always been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of [[Norfork Dam]], the [[Norfork Tailwater]] and the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] have become a destination for [[trout]] fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas|Bull Shoals]], [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas|Hot Springs Village]], and [[Fairfield Bay, Arkansas|Fairfield Bay]] have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The [[Buffalo National River]] has been preserved in its natural state by the [[National Park Service]] and is frequented by fly fishers annually.

Healthcare in Arkansas is provided by a network of hospitals as members of the Arkansas Hospital Association. Major institutions with multiple branches include Baptist Health, [[Community Health Systems]], and [[HealthSouth]]. The [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]] (UAMS) in Little Rock operates the [[UAMS Medical Center]], a [[teaching hospital]] ranked as high performing nationally in [[cancer]] and [[nephrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences |url= http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ar/uams-medical-center-6710440 |publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report |website= Health &amp; Hospitals |accessdate= January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pediatric division of UAMS Medical Center is known as [[Arkansas Children's Hospital]], nationally ranked in pediatric [[cardiology]] and heart surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Arkansas Children's Hospital |url= http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ar/arkansas-children%27s-hospital-6710340 |publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report |website= Health &amp; Hospitals |accessdate= January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these two institutions are the state's only [[Level I trauma center]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Designated Trauma Centers |url= http://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programsServices/injuryPreventionControl/TraumaticSystems/Pages/DesignatedTraumaCenters.aspx |date= December 17, 2012 |publisher= Arkansas Department of Health |accessdate= January 21, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211165823/http://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programsServices/injuryPreventionControl/TraumaticSystems/Pages/DesignatedTraumaCenters.aspx |archivedate= February 11, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state supports a network of public [[university|universities]] and colleges, including two major university systems: [[Arkansas State University System]] and [[University of Arkansas System]]. The [[University of Arkansas]], flagship campus of the University of Arkansas System in Fayetteville was ranked #63 among public schools in the nation by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website= College Ranking Lists |url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public/spp%2B50/page+2 |publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report |title= Top Public Schools |year= 2014 |accessdate= January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other public institutions include [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas Tech University]], [[Henderson State University]], [[Southern Arkansas University]], and [[University of Central Arkansas]] across the state.

In the 1920s the state required all children to attend public schools. The school year was set at 131 days, although some areas were unable to meet that requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holley|first1=Marc J|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William Oscar|title=History of Public School Education in Arkansas; 1900–1918|date=August 30, 1918|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Education|page=Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally prohibited in the [[Western world|West]] at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Arkansas, with 20,083 public school students&lt;ref&gt;Please note this figure refers to only the number of students paddled, regardless of whether a student was spanked multiple times in a year, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be substantially higher.&lt;/ref&gt; [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of corporal punishment in public schools is higher only in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=World Corporal Punishment Research | last = Farrell | first = Colin | date=February 2016|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational attainment===

Arkansas is one of the most under-educated states in the Union. It ranks near the bottom in terms of percentage of the population with either a high school or college degree. The state's educational system has a history of under-funding, low teachers' salaries and political meddling in the curriculum.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holley|first1=Marc J|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2164|website=Education Reform|publisher=University of Arkansas|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational statistics during these early days are fragmentary and unreliable. Many counties did not submit full reports to the secretary of state who did double-duty as commissioner of common schools. However, the percentage of whites over twenty years of age who were illiterate was given as:
:1840, 21%
:1850, 25%
:1860, 17%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William Oscar|title=History of Public School Education in Arkansas; 1900–1918|date=August 30, 1918|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Education|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Arkansas students earned an average score of 20.3 on the [[ACT (examination)|ACT exam]], just below the national average of 21. These results were expected due to the large increase in the number of students taking the exam since the establishment of the Academic Challenge Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Arkansas's ACT score slips in 2010 | date= August 18, 2010 | publisher= Arkansas Public School Resource Center | url= http://www.apsrc.net/Newsletter/NewsletterDisplay.asp?p1=133&amp;p2=Y&amp;Sort= | accessdate= September 3, 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082700/http://www.apsrc.net/Newsletter/NewsletterDisplay.asp?p1=133&amp;p2=Y&amp;Sort= | archive-date= January 17, 2013 | url-status= dead | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top high schools receiving recognition from the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] are spread across the state, including [[Haas Hall Academy]] in Fayetteville, [[KIPP Delta Collegiate High School|KIPP Delta Collegiate]] in [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena-West Helena]], [[Bentonville High School|Bentonville]], [[Rogers High School (Arkansas)|Rogers]], [[Rogers Heritage High School|Rogers Heritage]], [[Valley Springs High School|Valley Springs]], [[Searcy High School (Arkansas)|Searcy]], and [[McCrory High School|McCrory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Best High Schools in Arkansas |url= https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/arkansas |magazine= U.S. News &amp; World Report |year= 2012 |accessdate= September 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 81 Arkansas high schools were ranked by the U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Arkansas High Schools |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/arkansas/rankings |magazine=U.S. News &amp; World Report |year=2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830033733/http://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/arkansas/rankings |archivedate=August 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===

As an organized territory, and later in the early days of statehood, education was funded by the sales of federally controlled public lands. This system was inadequate and prone to local graft. In an 1854 message to the legislature, Governor [[Elias N. Conway]] said, &quot;We have a common-school law intended as a system to establish common schools in all part of the state; but for the want of adequate means there are very few in operation under this law.&quot; At the time, only about a quarter of children were enrolled in school.
&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William Oscar|title=History of Public School Education in Arkansas; 1900–1918|date=August 30, 1918|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Education|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the American Civil War, the state had only twenty-five publicly funded common schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William Oscar|title=History of Public School Education in Arkansas; 1900–1918|date=August 30, 1918|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Education|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the state legislature was still controlled by ex-Confederates. It passed a Common Schools Law that allowed public funded but limited schools to white children.

The 1868 legislature banned former Confederates and passed a more wide-ranging law detailing funding and administrative issues and allowing black children to attend school. In furtherance of this, the postwar 1868 state constitution was the first to permit a personal-property tax to fund the lands and buildings for public schools. With the 1868 elections, the first county school commissioners took office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William Oscar|title=History of Public School Education in Arkansas; 1900–1918|date=August 30, 1918|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Education|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the state spent $9,616 per student, compared with a national average of about $11,000 putting Arkansas in nineteenth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Spending Per Student by State|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html|publisher=Governing|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas is served by {{convert|2750|mi|km}} of railroad track divided among twenty-six railroad companies including three [[Class I railroads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arkansas State Rail Plan |page=3 |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/planning_research/statewide_planning/SRP_2002all.pdf |format=PDF |year=2002 |publisher=Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department |accessdate=August 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082700/http://www.arkansashighways.com/planning_research/statewide_planning/SRP_2002all.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freight railroads are concentrated in southeast Arkansas to serve the industries in the region. The [[Texas Eagle]], an Amtrak passenger train, serves five stations in the state [[Walnut Ridge (Amtrak station)|Walnut Ridge]], [[Little Rock (Amtrak station)|Little Rock]], [[Malvern (Amtrak station)|Malvern]], [[Arkadelphia (Amtrak station)|Arkadelphia]], and [[Texarkana (Amtrak station)|Texarkana]].

Arkansas also benefits from the use of its rivers for commerce. The [[Mississippi River]] and [[Arkansas River]] are both major rivers. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains the [[McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System]], allowing barge traffic up the Arkansas River to the [[Port of Catoosa]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

There are four airports with commercial service: [[Clinton National Airport]], [[Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport]], [[Fort Smith Regional Airport]], and [[Texarkana Regional Airport]], with [[List of airports in Arkansas|dozens of smaller airports in the state]].

Public transit and community transport services for the elderly or those with developmental disabilities are provided by agencies such as the [[Central Arkansas Transit Authority]] and the [[Ozark Regional Transit]], organizations that are part of the [[Arkansas Transit Association]].

==Law and government==

{{Main|Politics and government of Arkansas}}

As with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term {{subst:lc:Limits}} in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |website= Joint Project on Term {{subst:lc:Limits}} |page= 1 |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate= February 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive===

{{Main|Governor of Arkansas}}
{{See also|List of Governors of Arkansas}}

The governor of Arkansas is [[Asa Hutchinson]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], who was inaugurated on January 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.stateline.org/weekly/Stateline.org-Weekly-Original-Content-2006-11-06.pdf |title=Winners in '06 Governors races |format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728055148/http://archive.stateline.org/weekly/Stateline.org-Weekly-Original-Content-2006-11-06.pdf |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwe.arkansas.gov/GenIfo/administration.html |title=Arkansas.gov Administration page for Governor |publisher=Dwe.arkansas.gov |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614164225/http://dwe.arkansas.gov/GenIfo/administration.html |archivedate=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The six other elected executive positions in Arkansas are [[Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas|lieutenant governor]], [[Secretary of State of Arkansas|secretary of state]], [[Arkansas Attorney General|attorney general]], [[Arkansas State Treasurer|treasurer]], [[Arkansas State Auditor|auditor]], and [[Arkansas Land Commissioner|land commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Code 7 May 806.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor also appoints qualified individuals to lead various state boards, committees, and departments. Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 general election.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Office of Lieutenant Governor |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5722 |date= February 28, 2011 |publisher= The Pryor Center |website= Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate= January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative===

{{Main|Arkansas General Assembly}}
[[File:Confederate Women of Arkansas Monument, Arkansas State Capitol.JPG|thumb|The [[Arkansas General Assembly]] houses the state's [[Arkansas Senate|Senate]] and [[Arkansas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].]]

The [[Arkansas General Assembly]] is the state's [[bicameral]] bodies of legislators, composed of the [[Arkansas Senate|Senate]] and [[Arkansas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate contains 35 members from districts of approximately equal population. These districts are redrawn decennially with each US census, and in election years ending in &quot;2&quot;, the entire body is put up for reelection. Following the election, half of the seats are designated as two-year seats and are up for reelection again in two years, these &quot;half-terms&quot; do not count against a legislator's term limits. The remaining half serve a full four-year term. This staggers elections such that half the body is up for re-election every two years and allows for complete body turnover following redistricting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Greenberg |first= Dan |url= http://arkansaseconomics.org/policy/050105.html |title= The Dangers of Diluting Term {{subst:lc:Limits}} |publisher= Arkansas Policy Center |accessdate= February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas voters selected a 21–14 Republican majority in the Senate in 2012. Arkansas House members can serve a maximum of three two-year terms. House districts are redistricted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment. Following the 2012 elections, Republicans gained a 51–49 majority in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Republicans Take Control of Arkansas House, Senate |url= http://5newsonline.com/2012/11/13/republicans-take-control-of-arkansas-house-senate/ |first= Mallory |last= Cooke |publisher= [[KFSM-TV]] |accessdate= January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party [[majority]] status in the Arkansas State House of Representatives following the 2012 elections is the party's first since 1874. Arkansas was the last state of the old Confederacy to never have Republicans control either chamber of its house since the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Arkansas Senate flips; first time since Reconstruction |date= November 7, 2012 |publisher= The Courier |url= http://www.couriernews.com/view/full_story/20738303/article-Arkansas-Senate-flips--first-time-since-Reconstruction |accessdate= January 8, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082700/http://www.couriernews.com/view/full_story/20738303/article-Arkansas-Senate-flips--first-time-since-Reconstruction |archive-date= January 17, 2013 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the term limits changes, studies have shown that lobbyists have become less influential in state politics. Legislative staff, not subject to term limits, have acquired additional power and influence due to the high rate of elected official turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term {{subst:lc:Limits}} in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |website= Joint Project on Term {{subst:lc:Limits}} |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |format = PDF |pages=33–34 |accessdate= February 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial===

{{Main|Courts of Arkansas}}

Arkansas's judicial branch has five court systems: [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], [[Arkansas Court of Appeals]], Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.

Most cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. 25 state district court judges preside over 15 districts, with more districts created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no [[appeal|right of appeal]] from the Court of Appeals to the high court. The Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.

The Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court's decisions can be appealed to only the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

===Federal===

Both Arkansas's U.S. senators, [[John Boozman]] and [[Tom Cotton]], are Republicans. The state has four seats in [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. All four seats are held by Republicans: [[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] ([[Arkansas's 1st congressional district|1st district]]), [[French Hill (politician)|French Hill]] ([[Arkansas's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]]), [[Steve Womack]] ([[Arkansas's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]]), and [[Bruce Westerman]] ([[Arkansas's 4th congressional district|4th district]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;sw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= New Arkansas Rep.

===Politics===

{{main|Politics and government of Arkansas}}
[[File:William J. Clinton Presidential Library, Little Rock, Arkansas (exterior view - 2007).jpg|thumb|The [[Clinton Presidential Center]] in Little Rock]]

Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] brought national attention to the state with a long speech at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] endorsing [[Michael Dukakis]]. Some journalists suggested the speech was a threat to his ambitions; Clinton defined it &quot;a comedy of error, just one of those fluky things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/30/when_bill_clinton_died_on_stage/|title=When Bill Clinton died onstage|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|website=Salon|access-date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton won the Democratic nomination for president the following cycle. Presenting himself as a &quot;New Democrat&quot; and using incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Read my lips: no new taxes|broken promise]] against him, Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).

Most Republican strength traditionally lay mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.

Arkansas has elected only three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]]; [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]; and [[Tom Cotton]], who defeated Mark Pryor in the 2014 elections. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and [[Virginia]]) for any period during the first decade of the 21st century.

In 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2012, Republicans won election for all four House seats. Arkansas held the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed entirely of military veterans ([[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]], [[United States Army|Army]]; [[Tim Griffin]], [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]; [[Steve Womack]], Army [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]; [[Tom Cotton]], Army). In 2014, the last Democrat in Arkansas's congressional delegation, Mark Pryor, was defeated in his campaign to win a third term in the U.S. Senate, leaving the entire congressional delegation in GOP hands for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the [[Arkansas Constitution]] Arkansas is a [[right to work state]], its voters passed a ban on [[same-sex marriage]] with 75% voting yes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/ballot.measures/|title=CNN: Election 2004—Ballot Measures|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning abortion in the event ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is ever overturned.

====White supremacy, hate crimes====

Arkansas is one of only four states in the U.S. to not have any legal protection against [[hate crimes]] (an anti-hate crimes measure passed the state Senate in 2001 but failed before a House panel, and a similar bill failed in 2017). The forests of Arkansas and the [[Ozarks|Ozark mountain region]] have provided cover for clandestine hate groups. [[White nationalist]] groups such as [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (abbreviated CSA. In the 1980s this group had a compound in the Ozarks, later raided by the authorities) found cover in the Ozarks, as the overwhelmingly [[White people|white]] towns are small and spread far and wide throughout the mountains. The [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|Knights of the KKK]] and the [[Kingdom Identity Ministries]] (a [[Christian identity]] organization) made their headquarters in the state at this time. In the early 1990s, a series of race riots occurred in Harrison (the largest town in Arkansas and home to the (K)KKK and KIM) led to most of that town's African-American population to flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeMillo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=DeMillo |first1=Andrew |title=Arkansas, home to supremacist groups, weighs hate crimes law |url=https://apnews.com/cec9849da0fc43898d753714023857a0 |accessdate=August 25, 2019 |work=AP News |date=August 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, prosecutors in Little Rock unsealed indictments against 54 members of the [[New Aryan Empire]] (a white supremacist group that began as a prison gang). Most of the NEE members indicted in 2019 are from Russellville. Its leader briefly escaped from a Pine Bluff jail in August of that year. In May, another group of white supremacists protesters carrying [[Flag of Germany#Nazi Germany and World War II (1933–1945)|the flag of Nazi Germany]] also disrupted a [[Holocaust]] remembrance event in Russellville. Billboards have appeared in the state displaying white supremacist slogans (e.g. &quot;[[anti-racist is a code word for anti-white]]&quot;) or promoting white pride websites. In 2018, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (an organization which tracks hate groups) identified 14 distinct hate groups in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeMillo&quot; /&gt;

In 2019, Republican Governor [[Asa Hutchinson]] (who as federal prosecutor in the 1980s was involved in negotiations with the CSA) and Democratic Senator [[Joyce Elliott]] have called on lawmakers in the state to approve harsher penalties for hate crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeMillo&quot; /&gt;

===Military===

The [[Strategic Air Command]] facility of [[Little Rock Air Force Base]] was one of eighteen silos in the command of the [[308th Armament Systems Wing#Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles|308th Strategic Missile Wing]] (308th SMW), specifically one of the nine silos within its [[374th Strategic Missile Squadron]] (374th SMS). The squadron was responsible for Launch Complex 374-7, site of the [[1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion|1980 explosion]] of a [[Titan (missile)|Titan II]] Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) in [[Damascus, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Schlosser|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2013|isbn=1594202273|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/commandcontrol00eric/page/ Title]|url=https://archive.org/details/commandcontrol00eric/page/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
