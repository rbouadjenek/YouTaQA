An '''autosome''' is any [[chromosome]] that is not a sex chromosome (an [[allosome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Griffiths | first=Anthony J. F. | title=An Introduction to genetic analysis | year=1999 | publisher=W.H. Freeman | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-7167-3771-1 | pages= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=autosome&amp;rid=iga.section.222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of an autosome pair in a [[diploid]] cell have the same morphology, unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structures. The [[DNA]] in autosomes is collectively known as '''atDNA''' or '''auDNA'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA|title=Autosomal DNA - ISOGG Wiki|website=www.isogg.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821085342/https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA|archivedate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[human]]s have a [[diploid]] [[human genome|genome]] that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one [[allosome]] pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome|title=Resources|first=Genetics Home|last=Reference|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102070828/http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome|archivedate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two [[X chromosome]]s in females or one X and one [[Y chromosome]] in males. Unusual combinations of [[XYY syndrome|XYY]], [[Klinefelter syndrome|XXY]], [[Triple X syndrome|XXX]], [[XXXX syndrome|XXXX]], [[XXXXX syndrome|XXXXX]] or [[XXYY syndrome|XXYY]], among [[Aneuploidy|other allosome combinations]], are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.

Autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. For example, the [[SRY]] gene on the Y chromosome encodes the transcription factor [[Testis determining factor|TDF]] and is vital for male sex determination during development. TDF functions by activating the [[SOX9]] gene on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]], so mutations of the [[SOX9]] gene can cause humans with an ordinary Y chromosome to develop as females.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7990924&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster JW, Dominguez-Steglich MA, Guioli S, Kwok C, Weller PA, Stevanović M, Weissenbach J, Mansour S, Young ID, Goodfellow PN | title = Campomelic dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal caused by mutations in an SRY-related gene | journal = Nature | volume = 372 | issue = 6506 | pages = 525–30 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7990924 | doi = 10.1038/372525a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from a cell arrested in [[metaphase]] or [[prometaphase]] and then staining them with a type of dye (most commonly, [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Chromosome mapping Facts, information, pictures |series=Encyclopedia.com articles about Chromosome mapping |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Chromosome_mapping.aspx |website=encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210220706/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Chromosome_mapping.aspx |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chromosomes are typically viewed as [[karyogram]]s for easy comparison. Clinical geneticists can compare the karyogram of an individual to a reference karyogram to discover the cytogenetic basis of certain [[phenotype]]s. For example, the karyogram of someone with [[Patau syndrome|Patau Syndrome]] would show that they possess three copies of [[Chromosome 13 (human)|chromosome 13]]. Karyograms and staining techniques can only detect large-scale disruptions to chromosomes—chromosomal aberrations smaller than a few million base pairs generally cannot be seen on a karyogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nussbaum RL, McInnes RR, Willard HF, Hamosh A, Thompson MW |year=2007 |title=Thompson &amp; Thompson Genetics in Medicine |edition=7th |page=69 |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autosomal genetic disorders ==
[[File:Autosomal recessive inheritance.gif|thumb|An illustration of the inheritance pattern and phenotypic effects of an autosomal recessive gene.]]
Autosomal genetic disorders can arise due to a number of causes, some of the most common being [[nondisjunction]] in parental germ cells or [[Mendelian inheritance]] of deleterious alleles from parents. Autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit Mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an [[autosomal dominant]] or recessive fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = human genetic disease|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151013183225/http://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease|archivedate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gregor Mendel and Single-Gene Disorders {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-genetics-patterns-of-inheritance-and-single-966|website = www.nature.com|accessdate = 2015-10-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151024030125/http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-genetics-patterns-of-inheritance-and-single-966|archivedate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child, as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious [[allele]] to manifest the disease. Autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest. Because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype, two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers (also known as [[heterozygote]]s) for the condition.

Autosomal [[aneuploidy]] can also result in disease conditions. Aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus. Fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-rich chromosomes—such as [[Chromosome 1 (human)|chromosome 1]]—never survive to term,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 978-1-58829-300-8|pages = 133–164|first = Jin-Chen C.|last = Wang|editor-first = Steven L.|editor-last = Gersen|editor-first2 = Martha B. Keagle|editor-last2 = MEd|doi = 10.1385/1-59259-833-1:133|title = The Principles of Clinical Cytogenetics|chapter = Autosomal Aneuploidy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-poor chromosomes—such as [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]]— are still miscarried over 23% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16634111&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Savva GM, Morris JK, Mutton DE, Alberman E | title = Maternal age-specific fetal loss rates in Down syndrome pregnancies | journal = Prenat. Diagn. | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 499–504 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16634111 |issn = 0197-3851| doi = 10.1002/pd.1443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possessing a single copy of an autosome (known as a monosomy) is nearly always incompatible with life, though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth. Having three copies of an autosome (known as a trisomy) is far more compatible with life, however. A common example is [[Down syndrome]], which is caused by possessing three copies of [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]] instead of the usual two.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Partial aneuploidy can also occur as a result of [[Chromosomal translocation|unbalanced translocations]] during meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Translocation - Glossary Entry|url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=translocation|website = Genetics Home Reference|date = 2015-11-02|accessdate = 2015-11-08|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209181233/http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=translocation|archivedate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial monosomies, while duplications can cause partial trisomies. If the duplication or deletion is large enough, it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual. Autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases, ranging from [[cancer]] to [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19556891&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strefford JC, An Q, Harrison CJ | title = Modeling the molecular consequences of unbalanced translocations in cancer: lessons from acute lymphoblastic leukemia | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 8 | issue = 14 | pages = 2175–84 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19556891|issn = 1551-4005 | doi = 10.4161/cc.8.14.9103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11973326&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klar AJ | title = The chromosome 1;11 translocation provides the best evidence supporting genetic etiology for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders | journal = Genetics | volume = 160 | issue = 4 | pages = 1745–7 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11973326 | pmc = 1462039 | issn = 0016-6731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike single gene disorders, diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper [[gene dosage]], not nonfunctional gene product.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22974302&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Disteche CM | title = Dosage compensation of the sex chromosomes | journal = Annu.
