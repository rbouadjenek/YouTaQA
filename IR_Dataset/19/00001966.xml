'''Apollo 10''' was a May 1969 [[human spaceflight]], the fourth crewed mission in the United States [[Apollo program]], and the second (after [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]]) to orbit the Moon. It was the [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|F{{nbsp}}mission]]: a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the first [[Moon landing]], testing all the components and procedures just short of actually landing. Astronauts [[Thomas P. Stafford|Thomas Stafford]] and [[Gene Cernan]] flew the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) to a descent orbit within {{convert|8.4|nmi|km|sp=us}} of the [[lunar surface]], the point where powered descent for landing would begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/Ap10.html |title=Mission Report: Apollo 10 |date=June 17, 1969 |publisher=NASA |id=MR-4 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After orbiting the Moon 31 times&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_10a_Summary.htm NASA Apollo 10 page]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 10 returned safely to Earth, and its success enabled the first actual landing ([[Apollo 11]]) two months later.

Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a crewed vehicle: 39,897&amp;nbsp;km/h (11.08&amp;nbsp;km/s or 24,791&amp;nbsp;mph) on May 26, 1969, during the return from the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/content/apollo-10-was-moon-landing-rehearsal-eft-1-preps-for-trips-beyond NASA - Apollo 10 was Moon Landing Rehearsal, EFT-1 Preps for Trips Beyond]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew notes===
Apollo 10 and Apollo 11 were the only Apollo missions whose crew were all veterans of spaceflight. [[Thomas P. Stafford]] had flown on [[Gemini 6A|Gemini 6]] and [[Gemini 9A|Gemini 9]]; [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]] had flown on [[Gemini 3]] and [[Gemini 10]], and [[Eugene Cernan|Eugene A. Cernan]] had flown with Stafford on Gemini{{nbsp}}9.

In addition, Apollo 10 was the only [[Saturn V|Saturn{{nbsp}}V]] flight from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]], as preparations for Apollo 11 at LC-39A had begun in March almost immediately after [[Apollo 9|Apollo{{nbsp}}9]]'s launch.

They were also the only Apollo crew all of whose members went on to fly subsequent missions aboard [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]]: Young later commanded [[Apollo 16]], Cernan commanded [[Apollo 17]] and Stafford commanded the U.S. vehicle on the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]]. It was on Apollo 10 that John Young became the first human to fly solo around the Moon, while Stafford and Cernan flew the LM in lunar orbit as part of the preparations for Apollo 11. Young was also backup commander of [[Apollo 13]] and Apollo 17 and Cernan was backup commander of Apollo 14.

The Apollo 10 crew are also the humans who have traveled the farthest away from home, some {{convert|408950|km|nmi|sp=us}} from their homes and families in [[Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-06/far-away-from-home |title=Far Away From Home |last=Holtkamp |first=Gerhard |date=June 6, 2009 |work=SpaceTimeDreamer |publisher=SciLogs |type=Blog |accessdate=20 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031132720/http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-06/far-away-from-home |archivedate=October 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Apollo missions orbited the Moon at the same {{convert|111|km|nmi|sp=us}} from the lunar surface, the distance between the Earth and Moon varies by about {{convert|43000|km|nmi|sp=us}}, between [[perigee]] and [[apogee]], throughout each lunar month, and the Earth's rotation makes the distance to Houston vary by another {{convert|12000|km|nmi|sp=us}} each day. The Apollo 10 crew reached the farthest point in their orbit around the far side of the Moon at about the same time Earth's rotation put Houston nearly a full Earth diameter away.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glenday|Glenday 2010]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

By the normal rotation in place during Apollo, the backup crew would have been scheduled to fly on Apollo 13. However, [[Alan Shepard]], then number two at the [[Chief of the Astronaut Office|Astronaut Office]], gave himself the Apollo 13 command slot instead. [[Gordon Cooper|L. Gordon Cooper Jr.]], Commander of the Apollo 10 backup crew, was enraged and resigned from NASA. Later, Shepard's crew was forced to switch places with [[Jim Lovell]]'s tentative [[Apollo 14]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 2007]], pp. 347–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deke Slayton]] wrote in his memoirs that Cooper and [[Donn F. Eisele]] were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7|Apollo{{nbsp}}7]] plus an extramarital affair) and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of a lack of qualified manpower in the [[Chief of the Astronaut Office|Astronaut Office]] at the time the assignment needed to be made. Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (which was eventually cut down to only the [[Skylab]] component) and not a lunar mission.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Slayton &amp; Cassutt|Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994]], p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

This dress rehearsal for a Moon landing brought the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] to {{convert|8.4|nmi|km}} from the lunar surface, at the point where powered descent would begin on the actual landing. Practicing this approach orbit would refine knowledge of the [[Lunar orbit#Perturbation effects|lunar gravitational field]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_apollo10&quot;/&gt; needed to calibrate the powered descent guidance system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eyles |first=Don |title=Tales From the Lunar Module Guidance Computer |url=http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm |work=NASA Office of Logic Design |date=February 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; to within {{convert|1|nmi|km}} needed for a landing. Earth-based observations, uncrewed [[spacecraft]], and [[Apollo 8]] had respectively allowed calibration to within {{convert|200|nmi|km}}, {{convert|20|nmi|km}}, and {{convert|5|nmi|km}}. Except for this final stretch, the mission was designed to duplicate how a landing would have gone, both in space and for [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|ground control]], putting NASA's [[flight controller]]s and extensive tracking and control network through a rehearsal.

The ascent stage was loaded with the amount of [[aerozine 50|fuel]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide|oxidizer]] it would have had remaining if it had lifted off from the surface and reached the altitude at which the Apollo 10 ascent stage fired; this was only about half the total amount required for lift off and rendezvous with the CSM. The mission-loaded LM weighed {{convert|30735|lb|kg}}, compared to {{convert|33278|lb|kg}} for the Apollo 11 LM which made the first landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=June 25, 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Launch Vehicle/Spacecraft Key Facts |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-12_Launch_Vehicle-Spacecraft_Key_Facts.htm}} Statistical Table 18-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Nelson wrote in his book ''Rocket Men'' that NASA took special precaution to ensure Stafford and Cernan would not attempt to make the first landing. Nelson quoted Cernan as saying &quot;A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: 'Don't give those guys an opportunity to land, 'cause they might!' So the ascent module, the part we lifted off the lunar surface with, was short-fueled. The fuel tanks weren't full. So had we literally tried to land on the Moon, we couldn't have gotten off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nelson|Nelson 2009]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest measured point in the trajectory was {{convert|47400|ft|km}} above the lunar surface at 21:29:43 UTC.&lt;ref name=&quot;chariots12-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S.

[[File:AS10-34-5087.jpg|thumb|LM ''Snoopy'' containing Stafford and Cernan, as inspected by Young after separation from ''Charlie Brown'']]
[[File:Apollo 10 Earthrise.ogv|thumb|Earthrise video captured by Apollo 10 crew]]

Shortly after [[trans-lunar injection]], Young performed the [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver, separating the command and service module (CSM) from the [[S-IVB]] stage, turning around, and docking its nose to the top of the lunar module (LM), before separating from the S-IVB. Apollo 10 was the first mission to carry a [[color television]] camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV transmissions from space.

After reaching lunar orbit three days later, Young remained in the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) ''Charlie Brown'' while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM ''Snoopy'' and flew it separately. The LM crew performed the descent orbit insertion maneuver by firing their descent engine, and tested their craft's landing radar as they approached the {{convert|50000|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} altitude where the subsequent Apollo 11 mission would begin powered descent to actually land on the Moon. They surveyed the future Apollo 11 landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]], then jettisoned the descent stage and fired the [[Ascent Propulsion System|engine]] of the ascent stage to return to ''Charlie Brown'' Command Module. The descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually may have crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field. Its location is unknown as it was not tracked.

During descent stage separation, the lunar module began to roll unexpectedly because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{YouTube|id=fsObsxU08ys|title=&quot;Astronaut Gene Cernan Interview on Apollo 10 (December 23, 2009)&quot;|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM. Decades later, Cernan said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over, indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under ascent engine power. Recordings from the flight do not support this dramatic memory.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap10fj/video/staging-with-audio.mp4&lt;/ref&gt; While the incident was downplayed by NASA, the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable, which would have resulted in the LM crashing into the lunar surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;/&gt;

After Stafford and Cernan docked with and re-entered ''Charlie Brown'', ''Snoopy's'' engine was fired to fuel deletion to send the ascent stage on a trajectory past the Moon and into a [[heliocentric orbit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_apollo10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;disposition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This maneuver was unlike the fate of the subsequent [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage, which was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash (post-Apollo 11 ascent stages were steered into the Moon to obtain readings from [[seismometers]] placed on the surface, except for [[Apollo 13]]'s ascent stage, which the crew used as a &quot;life boat&quot; to get safely back to Earth before releasing it to burn up in Earth's atmosphere).&lt;ref name=&quot;disposition&quot;/&gt;

''Snoopy'''s ascent stage orbit was not tracked after 1969, and its current location is unknown. In 2011, a group of amateur astronomers in the UK started a project to search for it. In 2019, the Royal Astronomical Society announced a possible rediscovery of ''Snoopy,'' determining that small Earth-crossing asteroid ''2018 AV2'' is likely the capsule with &quot;98%&quot; certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/astronomers-might-have-found-apollo-10-snoopy-module/| title=Astronomers Might Have Found Apollo 10's &quot;Snoopy&quot; Module| author=David Dickinson | accessdate=2019-06-14| }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only once-crewed spacecraft still in outer space without a crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;snoopysearch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Search for Apollo 10's 'Snoopy' |first=Mark |last=Thompson |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/apollo-10-search-snoopy-astronomy-110919.html |work=Discovery News |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |date=September 19, 2011 |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807120456/http://news.discovery.com/space/apollo-10-search-snoopy-astronomy-110919.html |archivedate=August 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snoopysearch2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Search for 'Snoopy': Astronomers &amp; Students Hunt for NASA's Lost Apollo 10 Module |first=Robert Z.|last= Pearlman |url=http://www.space.com/13010-snoopy-nasa-lost-apollo-10-lunar-module-search.html |work= |publisher= SPACE.com |date= September 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|Splashdown]] occurred in the Pacific Ocean on May 26, 1969, at 16:52:23 UTC, about {{convert|400|nmi|km}} east of [[American Samoa]]. The astronauts were recovered by {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|6}}, and subsequently flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a greeting reception, before being flown on a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu]].

After Apollo 10, NASA required astronauts to choose more &quot;dignified&quot; names for their command and lunar modules. This proved unenforceable: Apollo 16 astronauts Young, Mattingly and Duke chose ''Casper'', as in [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], for their command module name. The idea was to give children a way to identify with the mission by using humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Young Takes Rover for a Spin |first=Michael |last=Shinabery |url=http://moonandback.com/2012/09/30/young-takes-rover-for-a-spin-this-week-in-space-history/ |date=September 30, 2012 |work=moonandback.com |publisher=Moonandback Media LLC |location=Sacramento, CA |page=Part 2 of 3 |nopp=y |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dreamsofspace.blogspot.com/2010/12/apollo-16-poster-with-casper-friendly.html |title=Apollo 16 poster with Casper the Friendly Ghost (1972) |last=Sisson |first=John |date=December 13, 2010 |website=Dreams of Space |type=Blog |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware disposition==
The Smithsonian has been accountable for the command module ''Charlie Brown'' since 1970. The spacecraft was on display in several countries until it was placed on loan to the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/command-module-apollo-10|title=Command Module, Apollo 10|magazine=Smithsonian|access-date=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Charlie Brown'''s [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) was jettisoned just before re-entry and burned up in the Earth's atmosphere.

After [[translunar injection]], the Saturn V's [[S-IVB]] third stage was accelerated past Earth [[escape velocity]] and became a [[:Category:Derelict satellites in heliocentric orbit|derelict]] [[space debris|object]] where {{asof|2018|lc=y}}, it remains in a [[heliocentric orbit]].&lt;ref name=ha20130923&gt;

The ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ''Snoopy'' was jettisoned into a [[heliocentric orbit]]. On June 10, 2019 Nick Howes, a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], announced that he and his colleagues had located ''Snoopy'', whose location was previously unknown, based on radar astronomy data with 98% certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1138275/nasa-apollo-10-snoopy-moon-capsule-royal-astronomical-society-spacex-space-news|title=NASA Apollo 10: Astronomers '98 percent convinced' iconic Snoopy NASA capsule FOUND|last=Fish|first=Tom|date=2019-06-10|website=Express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Snoopy's'' descent stage was jettisoned in lunar orbit; its current location is unknown.  Further, it is unclear whether the descent stage impacted the lunar surface, or if it remains in lunar orbit.  Phil Stooke, a [[planetary science|planetary scientist]] who studied the lunar crash sites of the LM's ascent stages, wrote that the descent stage &quot;crashed at an unknown location&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2017/0207-finding-spacecraft-impacts-on-the-moon.html |last=Stooke |first=Phil |title=Finding spacecraft impacts on the Moon |date=February 20, 2017 |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another source stated that the descent stage &quot;eventually impact(ed) within a few degrees of the equator on the near side&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Launius |first1=Roger D. |last2=Johnston |first2=Andrew K. |title=Smithsonian Atlas of Space Exploration |year=2009 |publisher=Bunker Hill |website=www.bunkerhillpublishing.com |location=[[Piermont, New Hampshire]] |ISBN=9780061565267 |page=104-105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Richard Orloff and an official NASA mission summary stated simply that the descent stage entered lunar orbit, remaining silent on the question of whether the stage later impacted the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter= Apollo 10, The Fourth Mission: Testing the LM in Lunar Orbit |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_10a_Summary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 (mission summary) |date=July 8, 2009 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An amateur astronomy blog begun in early 2020 explored the possibility that the descent stage may still be in lunar orbit, using computer simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://snoopy.rogertwank.net/ |title=Chasing Snoopy's Tail |publisher=[[Blogger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission insignia==
[[File:Apollo 10 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-70).jpg|thumb|Apollo 10 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]

The shield-shaped emblem for the flight shows a large, three-dimensional [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] X sitting on the Moon's surface, in Stafford's words, &quot;to show that we had left our mark.&quot; Although it did not land on the Moon, the prominence of the number represents the significant contributions the mission made to the Apollo program. A CSM circles the Moon as an LM ascent stage flies up from its low pass over the lunar surface with its engine firing. The Earth is visible in the background. On the mission patch, a wide, light blue border carries the word APOLLO at the top and the crew names around the bottom. The patch is trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by Allen Stevens of [[Rockwell International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Hengeveld |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-052008a.html |title=The man behind the Moon mission patches |publisher=[[collectSPACE]] |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}} &quot;A version of this article was published concurrently in the [[British Interplanetary Society]]'s ''[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]]'' magazine.&quot; (June 2008; pp. 220–225).&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Space music&quot; mystery==
In February 2016 [[Discovery Channel]] broadcast a TV show suggesting that the mission witnessed mysterious or alien signals while on the [[far side of the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 10 Astronauts Heard Odd 'Music' on Far Side of Moon|url=http://www.seeker.com/apollo-10-astronauts-heard-odd-music-on-far-side-of-moon-1770917268.html|website=Seeker|accessdate=2016-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529123554/http://www.seeker.com/apollo-10-astronauts-heard-odd-music-on-far-side-of-moon-1770917268.html|archivedate=2016-05-29|date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomers mention the odd whistling sound that lasted nearly an hour. It was speculated that this is an evidence for [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO coverup]].
According to space journalist [[James Oberg]], the sound was most probably [[electromagnetic interference|radio interference]] between the command module and the lunar module landing vehicles. Describing it as &quot;outer-space type music&quot; was most probably due to [[Priming (psychology)|priming]], as suggested by [[Benjamin Radford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2016Seeker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink1=Benjamin Radford|title=Explaining Apollo 10 Astronauts 'Space Music'|url=http://www.seeker.com/explaining-apollo-10-astronauts-space-music-1770921767.html|website=Seeker|accessdate=2016-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726095231/http://www.seeker.com/explaining-apollo-10-astronauts-space-music-1770921767.html|archivedate=2016-07-26|date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
