A member of the [[Royal Society]], in the field of zoology he was the first person to describe the [[brood parasitism]] of the [[common cuckoo]]. In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]''.

==Early life==
[[File:Edward Jenner manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jenner's handwritten draft of the first vaccination is held at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in London]]
Edward Jenner was born on 17 May 1749&lt;ref name=&quot;About Edward Jenner&quot;/&gt; (6 May [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the [[vicar]] of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Edward Jenner&quot;/&gt;

He went to school in [[Wotton-under-Edge]] at Katherine Lady Berkeley's School and in [[Cirencester]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About Edward Jenner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jenner.ac.uk/edward-jenner |title=About Edward Jenner |work=The Jenner Institute |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he was [[inoculation|inoculated]] for [[smallpox]], which had a lifelong effect upon his general health. (Crucially this meant that he underwent [[variolation]] and not [[vaccination]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;About Edward Jenner&quot;/&gt; At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a [[surgeon]] of [[Chipping Sodbury]], South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Edward Jenner&quot;/&gt;

In 1770, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] and others at [[St George's Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/youngedward.html |title=Young Edward Jenner, Born in Berkeley |work=Edward Jenner Museum |access-date=4 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914084340/http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/youngedward.html |archive-date=14 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Osler]] records&lt;!-- lectures at Yale in 1913 - Bartlett free bookshelf on Web --&gt; that Hunter gave Jenner [[William Harvey]]'s advice, well known in medical circles (and characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), &quot;Don't think; try.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loncarek&quot;/&gt; Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over [[natural history]] and proposed him for the [[Royal Society]]. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful [[general practitioner|family doctor]] and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley.

Jenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, [[Rodborough]] (in [[Gloucestershire]]). Members dined together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on [[angina pectoris]], [[ophthalmia]], and cardiac valvular disease and commented on [[cowpox]]. He also belonged to a similar society which met in [[Alveston]], near Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=7135&amp;inst_id=8 &quot;Papers at the Royal College of Physicians summarised&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a master [[Freemasonry|mason]] on  30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449. From 1812–1813, he served as worshipful master of Royal Berkeley Lodge of Faith and Friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/jenner_e/jenner_e.html &quot;Edward Jenner biography&quot;].

== Zoology ==
Edward Jenner was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1788,&lt;!--or 1789: the Royal Society says 9, RCS say 8 and married afterward, that year--&gt; following his publication of a careful study of the previously misunderstood life of the nested [[common cuckoo|cuckoo]], a study that combined observation, experiment, and dissection.

[[File:Cuculus canorus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common cuckoo]]]]

Edward jenner described how the newly-hatched cuckoo pushed its host's eggs and fledgling chicks out of the nest (contrary to existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jennermuseum.com/ej/cuckoo.shtml Jenner Museum: Cuckoo&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923015150/http://www.jennermuseum.com/ej/cuckoo.shtml |date=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having observed this behaviour, Jenner demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for it—the baby cuckoo has a depression in its back, not present after 12 days of life, that enables it to cup eggs and other chicks. The adult does not remain long enough in the area to perform this task. Jenner's findings were published in ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Observations on the Natural History of the Cuckoo. By Mr. Edward Jenner. In a Letter to John Hunter, Esq. F. R. S Jenner, E Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (1776–1886). 1 January 1788. 78:219–237 [https://archive.org/details/philtrans06624558 (Archived Text)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo chicks evicting their nest mates: coincidental observations by Edward Jenner in England and Antoine Joseph Lottinger in France, Spencer G. Sealy and Mélanie F. Guigueno Department of Biological Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3T 2N2, Canada. Archives of Natural History. Volume 38, Page 220-228 {{doi|10.3366/anh.2011.0030}},  {{ISSN|0260-9541}}, Available Online October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The singularity of its shape is well adapted to these purposes; for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the scapula downwards is very broad, with a considerable depression in the middle. This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Some discrepancies in the paper are ascribed to Jenner's nephew, who is said to have fabricated certain observations.--&gt; Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.

Jenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Her description and illustration of this were enough to convince [[Charles Darwin]] to revise a later edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-link=Jemima Blackburn|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenner's interest in Zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation.  Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission.  At the time there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.  We see this connection now; many present day vaccinations include animal parts from cows, rabbits, and chicken eggs, which can be attributed to the work of Jenner and his cowpox/smallpox vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Alexandra Minna|last2=Markel|first2=Howard|date=|year=2005|title=The History of Vaccines and Immunization: Familiar Patterns, New Challenges|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=24|issue=3|pages=611–621|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611|pmid=15886151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and human medicine==

Jenner married Catherine Kingscote (died 1815 from [[tuberculosis]]) in March 1788. He might have met her while he and other fellows were experimenting with [[balloons]]. Jenner's trial balloon descended into [[Kingscote Park, Gloucestershire]], owned by Anthony Kingscote, one of whose daughters was Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B.

[[Inoculation]] was already a standard practice but involved serious risks, one of which was the fear that those inoculated would then transfer the disease to those around them due to their becoming carriers of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/lady-montagu-and-introduction-smallpox-inoculation-england|title=Lady Montagu and the Introduction of Smallpox Inoculation to England {{!}} Muslim Heritage|website=www.muslimheritage.com|language=en|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] had imported [[variolation]] to Britain after having observed it in [[Constantinople]].

[[File:Edward Jenner- Smallpox.svg|thumb|The steps taken by Edward Jenner to create vaccination, the first vaccine for smallpox. Jenner did this by inoculating James Phipps with cowpox, a virus similar to smallpox, to create immunity, unlike variolation, which used smallpox to create an immunity to itself.]]

By 1768, English physician [[John Fewster]] had realised that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Noting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox, Jenner postulated that the [[pus]] in the blisters that milkmaids received from [[cowpox]] (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox.

}}
[[File:Jenner phipps 01.jpg|thumb|Dr Jenner performing his first vaccination on [[James Phipps]], a boy of age 8. 14 May 1796]]
On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating [[James Phipps]], an eight-year-old boy who was the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom,&lt;ref name=&quot;JennerMuseum&quot;/&gt; whose hide now hangs on the wall of the [[St George's, University of London|St George's medical school]] library (now in [[Tooting]]). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on [[vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1556742&amp;pageno=13 An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, Edward Jenner]. Retrieved 17 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day, subsequently producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no full-blown infection. Later, he injected Phipps with [[variolation|variolous material]], the routine method of immunization at that time. No disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection.

Donald Hopkins has written, &quot;Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins&quot;/&gt; Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.

Jenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases, including his 11 months old son Robert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Williams | first = Gareth |title = Angel of Death: The Story of Smallpox |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |date=2010 |ISBN=9780230274716 |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolation{{spaced ndash}}the use of smallpox to induce immunity{{spaced ndash}}and provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge. (See [[Vaccination/Vaccination acts|Vaccination acts]]).

The success of his discovery soon spread around Europe and was used ''en masse'' in the Spanish [[Balmis Expedition]] (1803–1806), a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao, China, led by Dr. [[Francisco Javier de Balmis]] with the aim of giving thousands the smallpox vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carlos Franco-Paredes |author2=Lorena Lammoglia |author3=José Ignacio Santos-Preciado |title=The Spanish Royal Philanthropic Expedition to Bring Smallpox Vaccination to the New World and Asia in the 19th Century |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1285–1289 |year=2005 |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/9/1285.full |doi= 10.1086/496930 |pmid=16206103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote, &quot;I don’t imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Andean Studies: New Trends and Library Resources : Papers of the Forty-Fifth Annual Meeting of the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials&quot;, University of California, Los Angeles ... 27–31 May 2000&quot;. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon]], who at the time was [[Napoleonic Wars|at war with Britain]], had all his French troops vaccinated, awarded Jenner a medal, and at the request of Jenner he released two English prisoners of war and permitted their return home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Napoleon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Jenner Society and the Edward Jenner Museum: Tributes to a physician-scientist |first1=A.J. |last1=Morgan |first2=Gregory A. |last2=Poland |journal=[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]] |volume=29 |issue=Supplement 4 |date=30 December 2011 |pages=D152–D154 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.08.128 |url=http://www.edwardjennersociety.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Jenner-Society-and.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon remarked he could not &quot;refuse anything to one of the greatest benefactors of mankind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Napoleon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The relations between fellows of the Royal Society and French men of science when France and Britain were at war |last=De Beer |first=G.

Jenner's continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice. He was supported by his colleagues and the King in petitioning [[UK Parliament|Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpFIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Dr+John+Griffiths,+surgeon+to++st+George's+Hospital&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RXN6sKdiBg&amp;sig=FsSl_KTQOG0HPtnB0ndFEOvHXF0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHzOz3maTRAhWGJZQKHYCIC-8Q6AEINTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Dr+John+Griffiths,+surgeon+to++st+George's+Hospital&amp;f=false|title=Reports from Committees of the House of Commons which Have Been Printed by Order of the House: And are Not Inserted in the Journals [1715-1801|first=Great Britain Parliament House of|last=Commons|date=18 July 2018|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was granted £10,000 in 1802 for his work on vaccination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reward&quot;/&gt; In 1807, he was granted another £20,000 after the Royal College of Physicians confirmed the widespread efficacy of vaccination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reward&quot;&gt;J.

Jenner was also elected a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1802, and a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1806.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter J|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterJ.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1803 in London, he became president of the '''Jennerian Society''', concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate [[smallpox]]. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]) and presented several papers there.  In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.&lt;ref&gt;John Baron, Life of Edward Jenner (London, 1837), vol. 2, pp. 122–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to [[King George IV]], and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reward&quot;/&gt; He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his &quot;Observations on the Migration of Birds&quot; to the Royal Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reward&quot;/&gt;

== Death ==
Jenner was found in a state of [[apoplexy]] on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed. He never fully recovered and eventually died of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823, aged 73. He was buried in the Jenner family vault at the Church of St Mary, Berkley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-berkeley.co.uk/history/60-edward-jenner|title=Edward Jenner – St Mary's Church, Berkeley, Gloucestershire|access-date=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920055356/http://www.stmarys-berkeley.co.uk/history/60-edward-jenner|archive-date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his son Robert Fitzharding (* 1797; † 1854) and his daughter Catherine (* 1794; † 1833), his elder son Edward (* 1789; † 1810) having died of tuberculosis aged 21.&lt;ref&gt;Darren R.

However, his contemporary Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]] in his classic commentary on the Mishna [[Tiferet Yisrael (commentary)|Tiferet Yisrael]] wrote that Jenner was one of the &quot;righteous of the nations,&quot; deserving a lofty place in the World to Come, for having saved millions of people from smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Tiferet Yisrael (Boaz) on Avot 3:14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the [[World Health Organization]] declared smallpox an eradicated disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |title=Smallpox |year=2001 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta]] in the US, and in [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in [[Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/08/smallpox-vials-found-cardboard-box-maryland-laboratory &quot;Forgotten smallpox vials found in cardboard box at Maryland laboratory&quot;].

Jenner's vaccine laid the foundation for contemporary discoveries in [[immunology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JennerEssortment&quot;/&gt; In 2002, Jenner was named in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote. The [[moon|lunar]] crater [[Jenner (crater)|Jenner]] is named in his honour. Jenner was recognized in the TV show ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|''The Walking Dead'']]''.  In &quot;[[TS-19]]&quot;, a CDC scientist is named Edwin Jenner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/characters/nm0001187?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t182  The Walking Dead (2010– ) Noah Emmerich: Edwin Jenner] ''imdb.com'', accessed 8 May 3019&lt;/ref&gt;
