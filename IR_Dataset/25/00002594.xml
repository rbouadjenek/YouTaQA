'''Ants''' are [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insect]]s of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Formicidae''' and, along with the related [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s, belong to the [[Taxonomy (biology)|order]] [[Hymenoptera]]. Ants appear suddenly across the globe during the earliest part of the [[Late Cretaceous]], but are already considerably diversified by this time, suggesting an [[Ghost lineage|earlier origin]]. Ants evolved from [[Vespoidea|vespoid]] [[wasp]] ancestors in the [[Cretaceous]] period, and [[Evolutionary radiation|diversified]] after the rise of [[flowering plant]]s. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 [[List of ant genera (alphabetical)|species]] have been classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atbi.biosci.ohio-state.edu/hymenoptera/tsa.sppcount?the_taxon=Formicidae |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127143602/http://atbi.biosci.ohio-state.edu/hymenoptera/tsa.sppcount?the_taxon=Formicidae |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-27 |title=Hymenoptera name server.

Ants form [[Ant colony|colonies]] that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;FisherBolton2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Brian L.|last2=Bolton|first2=Barry | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ants of Africa and Madagascar: A Guide to the Genera|date=26 July 2016|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520290891|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Rajendra | name-list-format = vanc |title=Elements of Entomology|year=2006|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=9788171336777|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called &quot;drones&quot; (aner) and one or more fertile females called &quot;[[Queen ant|queens]]&quot; ([[gyne]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt; The colonies are described as [[superorganism]]s because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Oster GF, Wilson EO |year=1978|title=Caste and ecology in the social insects |publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton|pages=21–22|isbn=978-0-691-02361-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flannery2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Flannery|first=Tim | name-list-format = vanc |title=A Natural History of the Planet|year=2011|publisher=[[Grove/Atlantic, Inc.]]|isbn=978-0-8021-9560-9|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants have colonised almost every landmass on [[Earth]]. The only places lacking [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] ants are [[Antarctica]] and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the [[terrestrial animal]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz&quot;/&gt; Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long [[co-evolution]] with other species has led to [[mimicry|mimetic]], [[commensalism|commensal]], [[parasitism|parasitic]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships.&lt;ref name=TheAntsRelations&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

Ant societies have [[division of labour]], communication between individuals, and an ability to [[Problem solving|solve complex problems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SANdisk&quot;/&gt; These parallels with [[Civilization|human societies]] have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as [[biological pest control]] agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolldoblerWilsonAnts3&quot;/&gt; Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta''), are regarded as [[invasive species]], establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''ant'' and its chiefly dialectal form ''emmet''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/emmet emmet]. Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; come from ''{{lang|enm|ante}}'', ''{{lang|enm|emete}}'' of [[Middle English]], which come from ''{{lang|ang|ǣmette}}'' of [[Old English]], and these are all related to the dialectal [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|emt}}'' and the [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|āmeiza}}'', from which comes the modern [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Ameise}}''. All of these words come from West Germanic ''*{{lang|gmw|ǣmaitjōn}}'', and the original meaning of the word was &quot;the biter&quot; (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|ai-}}'', &quot;off, away&quot; + ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|mait-}}'' &quot;cut&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ant |title=ant|publisher= Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |access-date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ant |title=Ant. Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family name Formicidae is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|formīca}}'' (&quot;ant&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Simpson DP | title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell | year = 1979 | edition = 5 | location = London | isbn=978-0-304-52257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the words in other [[Romance languages]], such as the Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|formiga}}'', Italian ''{{lang|it|formica}}'', Spanish ''{{lang|es|hormiga}}'', Romanian ''{{lang|ro|furnică}}'', and French ''{{lang|fr|fourmi}}'' are derived. It has been hypothesised that a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *morwi- was used, cf. [[Sanskrit]] vamrah, Latin formīca, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μύρμηξ ''mýrmēx'', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''mraviji'', [[Old Irish]] ''moirb'', [[Old Norse]] ''maurr'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''mier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=formic |title=Formic |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family Formicidae belongs to the order [[Hymenoptera]], which also includes [[sawfly|sawflies]], [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s. Ants evolved from a lineage within the [[Aculeata|stinging wasps]], and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group of the [[Apoidea]].&lt;ref name=phylo /&gt; In 1966, [[E. O. Wilson]] and his colleagues identified the [[fossil]] remains of an ant (''[[Sphecomyrma]]'') that lived in the [[Cretaceous]] period.

During the Cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the [[Laurasia]]n supercontinent (the [[Northern Hemisphere]]). They were scarce in comparison to the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after [[adaptive radiation]] at the beginning of the [[Paleogene period]]. By the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]], ants had come to represent 20–40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the [[Eocene]] epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in [[Baltic amber]] fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).&lt;ref name=&quot;grimaldi2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAntEvo&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Termite]]s live in colonies and are sometimes called ‘white ants’, but termites are not ants. They are the sub-order [[Isoptera]], and together with [[cockroach]]es they form the order [[Blattodea]]. Blattodeans are related to [[mantid]]s, [[crickets]], and other winged insects that do not undergo full [[metamorphosis]]. Like ants, termites are [[eusociality|eusocial]], with sterile workers, but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorne |first=Barbara L  | name-list-format = vanc |year=1997 |title=Evolution of eusociality in termites |journal=Annu.

Most ant species are omnivorous [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]], but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20&amp;nbsp;% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz TR | title = In search of ant ancestors | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 26 | pages = 14028–9 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11106367 | pmc = 34089 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.011513798| bibcode = 2000PNAS...9714028S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
[[Image:Scheme ant worker anatomy-en.svg|thumb|450px|left|Diagram of a worker ant (''[[Pachycondyla verenae]]'')]]

Ants are distinct in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] from other insects in having elbowed [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], [[metapleural gland]]s, and a strong constriction of their second [[Abdomen|abdominal]] segment into a node-like [[petiole (insect anatomy)|petiole]]. The head, [[mesosoma]], and [[metasoma]] are the three distinct body segments (formally [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]). The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma ([[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and [[gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]] (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).&lt;ref&gt;Borror, Triplehorn &amp; Delong (1989), p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other insects, ants have an [[exoskeleton]], an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other [[vertebrate]]s. Insects do not have [[lung]]s; [[oxygen]] and other gases, such as [[carbon dioxide]], pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s. Insects also lack closed [[blood vessel]]s; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the &quot;[[dorsal aorta]]&quot;) that functions like a heart, and pumps [[haemolymph]] toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The [[nervous system]] consists of a [[ventral nerve cord]] that runs the length of the body, with several [[ganglia]] and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;&gt;Borror, Triplehorn &amp; Delong (1989), pp. 24–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head===
[[File:Portrait of an ant, profile view.jpg|thumb|Macro portrait of an ant]]
[[File:Bullant head detail.jpg|thumb|[[Bull ant]] showing the powerful mandibles and the relatively large compound eyes that provide excellent vision]]

An ant's head contains many [[sensory organs]]. Like most insects, ants have [[compound eye]]s made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes are good for acute movement detection, but do not offer a high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] image. They also have three small [[ocellus|ocelli]] (simple eyes) on the top of the head that detect light levels and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fent K, Wehner R | title = Oceili: a celestial compass in the desert ant cataglyphis | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4696 | pages = 192–4 | date = April 1985 | pmid = 17779641 | doi = 10.1126/science.228.4696.192 | bibcode = 1985Sci...228..192F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[vertebrate]]s, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] species are completely [[Blindness|blind]]. However, some ants, such as Australia's [[Myrmecia (ant)|bulldog ant]], have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a [[metre]] away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Exp. Biol.|volume=119| pages=115–131| year=1985| title=Attack behaviour and distance perception in the Australian bulldog ant ''Myrmecia nigriceps''|last=Eriksson|first=E.

Two [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] (&quot;feelers&quot;) are attached to the head; these organs detect chemicals, [[air current]]s, and [[vibration]]s; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt; In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eisner T, Happ GM | title=The infrabuccal pocket of a formicine ant: a social filtration device | journal=Psyche | volume=69 | pages=107–116 | year=1962 | url=http://psyche.entclub.org/69/69-107.html | doi=10.1155/1962/25068 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesosoma===
Both the [[arthropod leg|legs]] and [[insect wing|wings]] of the ant are attached to the [[mesosoma]] (&quot;thorax&quot;). The legs terminate in a hooked [[Chelae|claw]] which allows them to hook on and climb surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Holbrook, Tate|title=Ask a Biologist: Face to Face with Ants|publisher=ASU School of Life Sciences|url=https://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/ant-anatomy|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only reproductive ants, [[Queen (insect)|queens]], and males, have wings. Queens shed their wings after the [[nuptial flight]], leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. In a few species, wingless queens ([[ergatoid]]s) and males occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt;

===Metasoma===
The [[metasoma]] (the &quot;abdomen&quot;) of the ant houses important internal organs, including those of the reproductive, respiratory (tracheae), and excretory systems. Workers of many species have their [[ovipositor|egg-laying structures]] modified into [[stinger (organ)|stings]] that are used for subduing [[predation|prey]] and defending their nests.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt;

===Polymorphism===
[[Image:Atta.cephalotes.gamut.selection.jpg|thumb|right|Seven [[leafcutter ant]] workers of various castes (left) and two queens (right)]]

In the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]]. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt; Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called &quot;soldier&quot; ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their &quot;duties&quot; typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson EO | title = The origin and evolution of polymorphism in ants | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–56 | date = June 1953 | pmid = 13074471 | doi = 10.1086/399512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weaver ant]]s, for example, have a distinct [[bimodal]] size distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weber, NA|year=1946|title=Dimorphism in the African ''Oecophylla'' worker and an anomaly (Hym.: Formicidae)|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|volume=39|pages=7–10| url=http://antbase.org/ants/publications/10434/10434.pdf|doi=10.1093/aesa/39.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Edward O. | last1 = Wilson | first2 = Robert W. | last2 = Taylor | name-list-format = vanc|year=1964|title=A Fossil Ant Colony: New Evidence of Social Antiquity |journal=Psyche|volume=71|pages=93–103|url=http://psyche.entclub.org/pdf/71/71-093.pdf |doi=10.1155/1964/17612 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other species show continuous variation in the size of workers.

Workers cannot mate; however, because of the [[haplodiploid sex-determination system]] in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as [[honeypot ants]], young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called ''repletes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Børgesen LW |year=2000 |title=Nutritional function of replete workers in the pharaoh's ant, ''Monomorium pharaonis'' (L.)|journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=141–146 |doi=10.1007/PL00001692}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]''.

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Meat eater ant nest swarming02.jpg|thumb|[[Meat eater ant]] nest during swarming]]
The life of an ant starts from an [[egg (biology)|egg]]. If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female [[diploid]]; if not, it will be male [[haploid]]. Ants develop by [[complete metamorphosis]] with the [[larva]] stages passing through a [[pupa]]l stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. Food is given to the larvae by [[trophallaxis]], a process in which an ant [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]] liquid food held in its [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. This is also how adults share food, stored in the &quot;social stomach&quot;. Larvae, especially in the later stages, may also be provided solid food, such as [[trophic egg]]s, pieces of prey, and seeds brought by workers.

The larvae grow through a series of four or five [[moult]]s and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a [[Chrysalis|butterfly pupa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillott, Cedric |year=1995|title=Entomology|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-44967-3|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different [[caste (biology)|castes]] of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the [[polyphenism|control of gene expression]] by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The causes and consequences of genetic caste determination in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) |first1=Kirk E. |last1=Anderson |first2=Timothy A. |last2=Linksvayer |first3=Chris R. |last3=Smith  | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Myrmecol.

Some species, such as [[army ant]]s, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 351, 372&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ergate spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then graduates to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=1989|volume=34|pages=191–210|title=Foraging strategies of ants|author=Traniello JFA|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.34.010189.001203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sorensen A, Busch TM, Vinson SB |title=Behavioral flexibility of temporal sub-castes in the fire ant, ''Solenopsis invicta'', in response to food|journal=Psyche|volume=91|pages=319–332|year=1984|url=http://psyche.entclub.org/91/91-319.html|doi=10.1155/1984/39236|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens can live for up to 30&amp;nbsp;years, and workers live from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;years. Males, however, are more transitory, being quite short-lived and surviving for only a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller L|year=1998 |title=Queen lifespan and colony characteristics in ants and termites |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=45 |pages=235–246 |doi=10.1007/s000400050084 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times as long as solitary insects of a similar size.&lt;ref name=insencyc&gt;{{cite book|editor-link1=Nigel R.

Ants are active all year long in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter in a state of dormancy known as [[hibernation]]. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state ([[diapause]]), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kipyatkov VE|year=2001|title=Seasonal life cycles and the forms of dormancy in ants (Hymenoptera, Formicoidea)|journal=Acta Societatis Zoologicae Bohemicae|volume=65|issue=2|pages=198–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[Image:FlyingAnts.jpg|thumb|Ants mating]]

Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens, while others may exist without queens.

Drones can also mate with existing queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially attacked by the workers, it releases a mating [[pheromone]].

Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a [[pine tree]] to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] in their [[spermatheca]]e.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolldoblerWilsonAnts2&quot;&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 143–179&lt;/ref&gt;

Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics,&lt;ref name=&quot;SuddFranks2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Sudd JH, Franks NR |title=The Behavioural Ecology of Ants|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400931237|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site,&lt;ref name=&quot;HolldoblerWilsonAnts2&quot;/&gt; a process akin to [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]] in [[honeybee]]s.

===Communication===
[[File:Camponotus sericeus Senegal.jpg|thumb|Two ''[[Camponotus sericeus]]'' workers communicating through touch and pheromones]]
Ants communicate with each other using [[pheromone]]s, sounds, and touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson DE, Ratnieks FL | title = Communication in ants | journal = Current Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 15 | pages = R570–4 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16890508 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.015 | bibcode = 1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the [[red harvester ant]], than in other [[hymenopteran]] groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Goss S, Aron S, Deneubourg JL, Pasteels JM |year=1989|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=76 |pages=579–581 |doi=10.1007/BF00462870 |issue=12|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/use/publications/JLD/56.pdf|bibcode = 1989NW.....76..579G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use &quot;[[propaganda]] pheromones&quot; to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Ettorre P, Heinze J | journal = [[Acta Ethologica]] | year = 2001 | volume = 3 | pages = 67–82 | title = Sociobiology of slave-making ants | doi = 10.1007/s102110100038 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including [[Dufour's gland]]s, poison glands and glands on the [[hindgut]], [[pygidium]], [[rectum]], [[sternum]], and hind [[tibia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot;/&gt; Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by [[trophallaxis]], transferring information within the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Detrain C, Deneubourg JL, Pasteels JM |year=1999|title=Information processing in social insects|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-7643-5792-4|pages=224–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greene MJ, Gordon DM | title = Structural complexity of chemical recognition cues affects the perception of group membership in the ants Linephithema humile and Aphaenogaster cockerelli | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 210 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 897–905 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17297148 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.02706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.&lt;ref name=TheAntsPheroCastes&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as [[formic acid]] in the case of [[formicine]] ants, [[alkaloids]] and [[piperidines]] in [[fire ants]], and a variety of protein components in other ants. [[Bullet ant]]s (''[[Paraponera clavata|Paraponera]]''), located in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]].

Trap-jaw ants of the genus ''[[Odontomachus]]'' are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws, which snap shut faster than any other [[predatory]] [[appendage]]s within the [[animalia|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TrapJawPatek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patek SN, Baio JE, Fisher BL, Suarez AV | title = Multifunctionality and mechanical origins: ballistic jaw propulsion in trap-jaw ants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 34 | pages = 12787–92 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16924120 | pmc = 1568925 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0604290103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..10312787P }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of ''[[Odontomachus bauri]]'' recorded peak speeds of between {{convert|126|and|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with the jaws closing within 130 [[microsecond]]s on average.
The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a [[catapult]] to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrapJawPatek&quot; /&gt; Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of [[muscle]] and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of [[sensory receptor|sensory]] organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. Trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: ''[[Anochetus]]'', ''[[Orectognathus]]'', and ''[[Strumigenys]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;TrapJawPatek&quot; /&gt; plus some members of the Dacetini tribe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The trap-jaw mechanism in the Dacetine ant ''Daceton armigerum'' and ''Strumigenys'' sp|author=Gronenberg W|year=1996|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=9 |pages=2021–2033 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/9/2021.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are viewed as examples of [[convergent evolution]].

[[Camponotus saundersi|A Malaysian species of ant]] in the ''[[Camponotus]]'' ''cylindricus'' [[superspecies|group]] has enlarged mandibular glands that extend into their gaster. If combat takes a turn for the worse, a worker may perform a final act of [[autothysis|suicidal altruism]] by rupturing the membrane of its gaster, causing the content of its mandibular glands to burst from the [[anterior]] region of its head, spraying a poisonous, corrosive secretion containing [[acetophenone]]s and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers.

[[Image:Ant mound.jpg|thumb|Ant mound holes prevent water from entering the nest during rain.]]
In addition to defence against predators, ants need to protect their colonies from [[pathogen]]s.

===Learning===
Many animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from [[mammal]]s where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of [[tandem running]]. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks NR, Richardson T | title = Teaching in tandem-running ants | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7073 | pages = 153 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16407943 | doi = 10.1038/439153a | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..153F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled experiments with colonies of ''[[Cerapachys biroi]]'' suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravary F, Lecoutey E, Kaminski G, Châline N, Jaisson P | title = Individual experience alone can generate lasting division of labor in ants | journal = Current Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 15 | pages = 1308–12 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17629482 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.047 | bibcode = 1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nest construction===
{{Main|Ant colony}}
[[Image:WeaverAntNest.JPG|thumb|Leaf nest of [[weaver ants]], [[Pamalican]], [[Philippines]]]]

Complex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests may be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter,&lt;ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts2/&gt; and ants carefully select their nest sites; ''Temnothorax albipennis'' will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks NR, Hooper J, Webb C, Dornhaus A | title = Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–2 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 17148163 | pmc = 1626204 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[army ant]]s of South America, such as the ''[[Eciton burchellii]]'' species, and the [[driver ant]]s of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest ([[bivouac (ants)|bivouac]]) from their own bodies, by holding each other together.&lt;ref&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla'' spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of ''[[Polyrhachis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Robson SK, Kohout RJ |year=2005|title=Evolution of nest-weaving behaviour in arboreal nesting ants of the genus ''Polyrhachis'' Fr.

''[[Formica polyctena]]'', among other ant species, constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Frouz J |title=The Effect of Nest Moisture on Daily Temperature Regime in the Nests of ''Formica polyctena'' Wood Ants|journal=Insectes Sociaux| volume=47 |issue=3|year=2000|pages=229–235|doi=10.1007/PL00001708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called ''[[gongylidia]]''. [[Symbiosis|Symbiotic]] bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|year=1999|volume=398|title=Ants, plants and antibiotics|author=Schultz TR|pages=747–748 | doi = 10.1038/19619|issue=6730 |url=http://www.insecta.ufv.br/Entomologia/ent/disciplina/ban%20160/AULAP/aula2/AntsandBacteria.pdf|bibcode = 1999Natur.398..747S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locomotion===
[[File:Ant in Slow Motion.webm|thumb|left|Ant in Slow Motion]]

The female worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'') is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baroni-Urbani C, Boyan GS, Blarer A, Billen J, Musthak Ali TM |year=1994 |title=A novel mechanism for jumping in the Indian ant ''Harpegnathos saltator'' (Jerdon) (Formicidae, Ponerinae) |journal=[[Experientia]] |volume=50 |pages=63–71 |doi=10.1007/BF01992052}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several species of [[gliding ant]] including ''Cephalotes atratus''; this may be a common trait among arboreal ants with small colonies. Ants with this ability are able to control their horizontal movement so as to catch tree trunks when they fall from atop the forest canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yanoviak SP, Dudley R, Kaspari M | title = Directed aerial descent in canopy ants | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7026 | pages = 624–6 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15703745 | doi = 10.1038/nature03254 | url = http://www.canopyants.com/Nature05.pdf | url-status = dead | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..624Y | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070616090223/http://www.canopyants.com/Nature05.pdf | archive-date = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water, underground, or through spaces in vegetation. Some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mlot&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mlot NJ, Tovey CA, Hu DL | title = Fire ants self-assemble into waterproof rafts to survive floods | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 19 | pages = 7669–73 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21518911 | pmc = 3093451 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1016658108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.7669M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These rafts may also have a role in allowing ants to colonise islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morrison LW|year=1998|title=A review of Bahamian ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) biogeography|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=25|issue=3|pages=561–571|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1998.2530561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Polyrhachis sokolova]]'', a species of ant found in [[Australia]]n [[mangrove]] swamps, can swim and live in underwater nests.

===Cooperation and competition===
[[File:Ants eating cicada, jjron 22.11.2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meat ant|Meat-eater ants]] feeding on a [[cicada]]: social ants cooperate and collectively gather food]]
Not all ants have the same kind of societies. The Australian [[bulldog ant]]s are among the biggest and most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of ants. Like virtually all ants, they are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.&lt;ref name=Crosland1988&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-6055.1988.tb01179.x | title = Aspects of the biology of the primitive ant genus Myrmecia F.

Some species (such as ''[[Tetramorium caespitum]]'') attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies. Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves. Extreme specialists among these [[slave-raiding ant]]s, such as the [[Amazon ant]]s, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diehl E, Junqueira LK, Berti-Filho E |year=2005 |title=Ant and termite mound coinhabitants in the wetlands of Santo Antonio da Patrulha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil|journal=Brazilian Journal of Biology |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=431–437 |doi=10.1590/S1519-69842005000300008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captured workers of enslaved ''[[Temnothorax]]'' species have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making ''[[Temnothorax americanus]]'', but sparing the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Achenbach A, Foitzik S | title = First evidence for slave rebellion: enslaved ant workers systematically kill the brood of their social parasite protomognathus americanus | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 1068–75 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19243573 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00591.x }} See also [[New Scientist]], April 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent, which comes from [[hydrocarbon]]-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henderson G, Andersen JF, Phillips JK, Jeanne RL | title = Internest aggression and identification of possible nestmate discrimination pheromones in polygynous antFormica montana | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 2217–28 | date = July 1990 | pmid = 24264088 | doi = 10.1007/BF01026932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other even if they are of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The [[Argentine ant]], however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.

Parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species such as ''[[Strumigenys xenos]]'' are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their ''Strumigenys perplexa'' hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ward PS|year=1996|title=A new workerless social parasite in the ant genus ''Pseudomyrmex'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), with a discussion of the origin of social parasitism in ants|journal=[[Systematic Entomology]]|volume= 21|pages=253–263|url=https://archive.org/details/ants_08424|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3113.1996.d01-12.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor RW|year=1968|title=The Australian workerless inquiline ant, ''Strumigenys xenos'' Brown (Hymenoptera-Formicidae) recorded from New Zealand|journal= New Zealand Entomologist|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–49|url=https://archive.org/details/ants_10687|doi=10.1080/00779962.1968.9722888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.&lt;ref name=TheAntParasites&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 436–448&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sexual conflict|conflict between the sexes]] of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in ''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]'', where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fournier D, Estoup A, Orivel J, Foucaud J, Jourdan H, Le Breton J, Keller L | title = Clonal reproduction by males and females in the little fire ant | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1230–4 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15988525 | doi = 10.1038/nature03705 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1230F | url = https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_4B6DEB46C264.P001/REF.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships with other organisms===
[[File:Myrmarachne plataleoides female thailand.jpg|thumb|The spider ''[[Myrmarachne plataleoides]]'' (female shown) mimics [[weaver ant]]s to avoid predators.]]
Ants form [[symbiotic]] associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These [[inquiline]]s may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this [[ant mimicry]] (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving [[Batesian mimicry]], where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show [[Wasmannian mimicry]], a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ant-mimicry in Panamanian clubionid and salticid spiders (Araneae: Clubionidae, Salticidae)|author=Reiskind J|journal=Biotropica|volume=9|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1–8|doi=10.2307/2387854|jstor=2387854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Myrmecomorphy and myrmecophily in spiders: A Review|author=Cushing PE|journal=The Florida Entomologist|volume=80|issue=2|year=1997|pages=165–193|doi=10.2307/3495552|url=http://www.fcla.edu/FlaEnt/fe80p165.pdf|jstor=3495552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ant Receives Honeydew from Aphid.jpg|thumb|left|An ant collects [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] from an [[aphid]].]]
[[Aphid]]s and other [[hemiptera]]n insects secrete a sweet liquid called [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], when they feed on [[plant sap]]. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Styrsky JD, Eubanks MD | title = Ecological consequences of interactions between ants and honeydew-producing insects | journal = Proceedings.

The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend [[mealybug]]s to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jahn GC, Beardsley JW |year=1996 |title=Effects of ''Pheidole megacephala'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on survival and dispersal of ''Dysmicoccus neobrevipes'' (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) |journal=[[Journal of Economic Entomology]] |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=1124–1129|doi=10.1093/jee/89.5.1124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myrmecophile|Myrmecophilous]] (ant-loving) [[caterpillar]]s of the butterfly family [[Lycaenidae]] (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=DeVries PJ|year=1992 |title=Singing caterpillars, ants and symbiosis |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=267 |pages=76–82 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1092-76 |issue=4|bibcode=1992SciAm.267d..76D }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar adaptation can be seen in [[Grizzled skipper]] butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elfferich|first=Nico W. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1998|title=Is the larval and imaginal signalling of Lycaenidae and other Lepidoptera related to communication with ants|url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/search?identifier=538588|journal=Deinsea|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae.

In his ''First Summer in the Sierra'', [[John Muir]] notes that the [[Mono people|Digger Indians]] of [[California]] ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black [[carpenter ant]]s.

[[File:Monomorium pharaonis.jpg|thumb|The tiny [[pharaoh ant]] is a major pest in hospitals and office blocks; it can make nests between sheets of paper.]]
Some ant species are considered as pests, primarily those that occur in human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the [[Argentine ant]], [[pavement ant]], [[yellow crazy ant]], [[banded sugar ant]], [[pharaoh ant]], [[Formica rufa|red ant]], [[carpenter ant]], [[Tapinoma sessile|odorous house ant]], [[red imported fire ant]], and [[Myrmica rubra|European fire ant]]. Some ants will raid stored food, some will seek water sources, others may damage indoor structures, some may damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests). Some will sting or bite.&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7411.html|title=Pest Notes: Ants (Publication 7411)|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|year=2007|access-date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical, biological, and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through [[trophallaxis]]. Management is based on the species and techniques may vary according to the location and circumstance.&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot; /&gt;

Observed by humans since the dawn of history, the behaviour of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, [[Myrmecology|myrmecologists]], study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal [[model organism]]s. [[Ultraviolet vision]] was first discovered in ants by [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Lubbock J | year=1881|title=Observations on ants, bees, and wasps.

The successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems, for example [[Ant colony optimization]] and [[Ant robotics]]. This area of [[biomimetics]] has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of &quot;foraging trails&quot;, fault-tolerant storage, and networking algorithms.&lt;ref name=&quot;SANdisk&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicke E, Byde A, Cliff D, Layzell P |year=2004 |title=An ant-inspired technique for storage area network design |journal=Proceedings of Biologically Inspired Approaches to Advanced Information Technology: First International Workshop, BioADIT 2004 LNCS 3141 |pages=364–379 |editor1=A.

From the late 1950s through the late 1970s, [[formicarium|ant farms]] were popular educational children's toys in the United States. Some later commercial versions use transparent gel instead of soil, allowing greater visibility at the cost of stressing the ants with unnatural light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country= US |number= 5803014 |status= granted |title= Habitat media for ants and other invertebrates|pubdate= |gdate= 8 September 1998 |inventor=  Guri A |assign1= Plant Cell Technology Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphised]] ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort.

Ant society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously. [[Mark Twain]] wrote about ants in his 1880 book ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=22 The Black Forest and Its Treasures|title=A Tramp Abroad|last=Twain|first=Mark|name-list-format=vanc|year=1880|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/119/|isbn=978-0-19-510137-9|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|access-date=2015-12-13|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/trampabroad0000twai_z6u7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual. Examples are [[Robert Frost]] in his poem &quot;Departmental&quot; and [[T. H. White]] in his fantasy novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. The plot in French entomologist and writer [[Bernard Werber]]'s ''[[Les Fourmis]]'' science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in Brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, ''[[Empire of the Ants|The Empire of the Ants]].'' In more recent times, animated cartoons and 3-D animated films featuring ants have been produced including ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'', ''[[Ferdy the Ant (TV series)|Ferdy the Ant]]'' and ''[[Atom Ant]].'' Renowned [[Myrmecology|myrmecologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] wrote a short story, &quot;Trailhead&quot; in 2010 for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, which describes the life and death of an ant-queen and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trailhead&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Wilson, EO|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/01/25/100125fi_fiction_wilson?currentPage=all |title=Trailhead|magazine=The New Yorker|date=25 January 2010|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Auguste Forel]] believed that ant societies were models for human society. He published a five volume work from 1921 to 1923 that examined ant biology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parent|first=André | name-list-format = vanc |date=2003|title=Auguste Forel on Ants and Neurology|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/chn/docpdf/parent_forel.pdf|journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences|volume=30|issue=3|pages=284–291|via=|doi=10.1017/s0317167100002754|pmid=12945958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the video game ''[[SimAnt]]'', which simulated an ant colony, won the 1992 [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] for &quot;Best Simulation Program&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1992.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611002722/http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1992.asp |archive-date=2009-06-11 |title= 1992 Excellence in Software Awards Winners |access-date=3 April 2008|publisher=Software &amp; Information Industry Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants also are quite popular inspiration for many [[science-fiction]] [[insectoid]]s, such as the Formics of ''[[Ender's Game]]'', the Bugs of ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', the giant ants in the films ''[[Them!]]'' and ''[[Empire of the Ants (film)|Empire of the Ants]],'' [[Marvel Comics]]' super hero [[Ant-Man]], and ants mutated into super-intelligence in ''[[Phase IV]]''. In computer [[strategy games]], ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series of games or the ChCht in ''[[Deadlock II]]''. These characters are often credited with a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], a common misconception about ant colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Robots, insects and swarm intelligence|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|volume=26|issue=4|year=2006|author=Sharkey AJC|doi=10.1007/s10462-007-9057-y|pages=255–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;
