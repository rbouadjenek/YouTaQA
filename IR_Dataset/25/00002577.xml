'''Adrastea''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|d|r|ə|ˈ|s|t|iː|ə}} {{Respell|ad-rə|STEE|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀδράστεια}}), also known as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter XV}}''', is the second by distance, and the smallest of the four [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|inner moons of Jupiter]]. It was discovered in photographs taken by ''[[Voyager&amp;nbsp;2]]'' in 1979, making it the first [[natural satellite]] to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary [[spacecraft]], rather than through a telescope.{{sfn|IAUC 3454}} It was officially named after the mythological [[Adrasteia]], foster mother of the [[Greek god]] [[Zeus]]—the equivalent of the [[Roman god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].{{sfn|IAUC 3872}}

Adrastea is one of the few moons in the [[Solar System]] known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Jupiter's Main Ring]] and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the [[Rings of Jupiter]]. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]], very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is [[tidally locked]] to [[Jupiter]].

== Discovery and observations ==
[[File:Adrastée FDS 20630.png|thumb|280px|left|Discovery image of Adrastea, taken on July 8, 1979, by ''Voyager&amp;nbsp;2''. Adrastea is the fainter dot, in the very middle, straddling the line of the Jovian rings.]]

Adrastea was discovered by [[David Jewitt|David C. Jewitt]] and [[G. Edward Danielson]] in ''[[Voyager 2|Voyager&amp;nbsp;2]]'' probe photographs taken on July 8, 1979, and received the designation '''{{nowrap|S/1979&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;1}}'''.{{sfn|IAUC 3454}}{{sfn|Jewitt Danielson et al.|1979}} Although it appeared only as a dot,{{sfn|Jewitt Danielson et al.|1979}} it was the first moon to be discovered by an interplanetary spacecraft. Soon after its discovery, two other of the inner [[moons of Jupiter]] ([[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]] and [[Metis (moon)|Metis]]) were observed in the images taken a few months earlier by ''[[Voyager 1|Voyager&amp;nbsp;1]]''. The [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] was able to determine the moon's shape in 1998, but the images remain poor.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} In 1983, Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph [[Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea]], the daughter of [[Zeus]] and his lover [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]].{{sfn|IAUC 3872}}

Although the ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'' orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called [[JunoCam]], it is almost entirely focused on observations of Jupiter itself. However, if all goes well should be able to capture some limited images of the Jupiter moons [[Metis (moon)|Metis]] and Adrastea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.P41B2066H JunoCam: Science and Outreach Opportunities with Juno&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Hansen, C. J.; Orton, G. S. American Geophysical Union 12/2015&lt;/ref&gt;





== Physical characteristics ==
Adrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20×16×14&amp;nbsp;km across.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]],{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}} around 0.86&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,{{sfn|Anderson Johnson et al.|2005}} its mass can be estimated at about 2{{E-sp|15}}&amp;nbsp;kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water [[ice]] with a [[porosity]] of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.{{sfn|Anderson Johnson et al.|2005}}

No surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}

== Orbit ==
[[File:PIA09921 Shepherd Moons.gif|thumb|Adrastea orbiting at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring, as imaged by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft on 24 February 2007]]

Adrastea is the smallest and second-closest member of the [[inner satellites of Jupiter|inner Jovian satellite family]]. It orbits [[Jupiter]] at a radius of about 129,000&amp;nbsp;km (1.806&amp;nbsp;Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Main Ring]].{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}} Adrastea is one of only three moons in the [[Solar System]] known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day—the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon [[Metis (moon)|Metis]], and [[Mars]]' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. The orbit has very small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]]—around 0.0015 and 0.03°, respectively. Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

Due to [[tidal locking]], Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter, this being the lowest energy configuration.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}

The orbit of Adrastea lies inside [[Jupiter]]'s [[synchronous orbit]] radius (as does [[Metis (moon)|Metis]]'s), and as a result, [[tidal deceleration|tidal force]]s are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid [[Roche limit]]. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

Adrastea is the second-fastest-moving of Jupiter's moons, with an orbital speed of 31.378&amp;nbsp;km/s.

== Relationship with Jupiter's rings ==
Adrastea is the largest contributor to material in [[rings of Jupiter|Jupiter's rings]]. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|Jupiter's four small inner satellites]] by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This is due to the satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their [[Roche sphere]]s.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

It seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material, as evidenced by the densest ring (the [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Main Ring]]) being located at and within Adrastea's orbit.{{sfn|Burns Showalter et al.|1999}} More precisely, the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter's Main Ring.{{sfn|Ockert-Bell Burns et al.|1999}}  The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images: in [[light scattering|forward-scattered light]] Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring,{{sfn|Ockert-Bell Burns et al.|1999}} but in [[Backscatter|back-scattered light]] (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrastea's orbit.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}
