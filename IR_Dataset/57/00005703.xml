{{short description|Postmodern science fiction genre in a futuristic setting}}
'''Cyberpunk''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] in a [[dystopia]]n [[Futurism|futuristic]] setting that tends to focus on a &quot;combination of [[low-life]] and [[high tech]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Bruce. Preface. ''Burning Chrome'', by William Gibson, Harper Collins, 1986, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cybernetics]], juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hassler |first= Donald M. |authorlink= |title= New Boundaries in Political Science Fiction |publisher= [[University of South Carolina Press]] |year= 2008 |pages= 75–76 |isbn= 978-1-57003-736-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the [[New Wave science fiction]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], [[J.&amp;nbsp;G. Ballard]], [[Philip José Farmer]] and [[Harlan Ellison]] examined the impact of [[drug culture]], technology, and the [[sexual revolution]] while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction.

[[Comic book|Comics]] exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as [[Judge Dredd]], first published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/cyberpunk/bibliography.html|title=Bibliography for GURPS Cyberpunk|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|website=sjgames.com|access-date=13 July 2019|quote=The world of the British Judge Dredd is quintessentially cyberpunk...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 1984, [[William Gibson]]'s influential [[debut novel]] ''[[Neuromancer]]'' would help solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from [[punk subculture]] and early [[hacker culture]]. Other influential cyberpunk writers included [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[Rudy Rucker]]. The [[Japanese cyberpunk]] subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s [[manga]] series ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', with its [[Akira (1988 film)|1988 anime film adaptation]] later popularizing the subgenre.

Early [[Filmmaking|films]] in the genre include [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', one of several of Philip K. Dick's works that have been adapted into films. The films ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995)&lt;ref name=&quot;ctheory1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=150 |title=CTheory.net |publisher=CTheory.net |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998),&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdverdict2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/newrosehotel.php |title=DVD Verdict Review&amp;nbsp;– New Rose Hotel |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2000-01-10 |accessdate=2009-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228231709/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/newrosehotel.php |archivedate=2008-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1999&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/100199rose-film-review.html |title='New Rose Hotel': Corporate Intrigue, Steamy Seduction |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-10-01 |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003) were some of the most successful cyberpunk films. More recent additions to this genre include ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' (2017), a sequel to the original 1982 film, as well as ''[[Upgrade (film)|Upgrade]]'' (2018), ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019) based on the 1990s Japanese manga ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'', and the 2018 [[Netflix]] TV series ''[[Altered Carbon (TV series)|Altered Carbon]]''.

== Background ==
Lawrence Person has attempted to define the content and ethos of the cyberpunk literary movement stating:

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Cyberpunk plots often center on conflict among [[artificial intelligence]]s, [[hackers]], and [[megacorporation]]s, and tend to be set in a near-future [[Earth]], rather than in the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'' or [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Graham |first= Stephen |authorlink= |title= The Cybercities Reader |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6Oe1m073C-0C&amp;pg=RA2-PT289 |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year= 2004 |page= 389 |isbn= 0-415-27956-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settings are usually [[post-industrial]] [[dystopia]]s but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors (&quot;the street finds its own uses for things&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson, William&quot;&gt;[[William Gibson|Gibson, William]] from ''Burning Chrome'' published in 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes [[film noir]], and written works in the genre often use techniques from [[detective fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gillis |first= Stacy |authorlink= |title= The Matrix Trilogy:Cyberpunk Reloaded |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bGi9FB3uEXkC&amp;pg=PA75 |publisher= Wallflower Press |year= 2005 |page= 75 |isbn= 1-904764-32-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are sources who view that cyberpunk has shifted from a literary movement to a mode of science fiction due to the limited number of writers and its transition to a more generalized cultural formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyberpunk and Visual Culture|last=Murphy|first=Graham|last2=Schmeink|first2=Lars|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351665155|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars|last=Landon|first=Brooks|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0415938884|location=New York|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Matrix Trilogy: Cyberpunk Reloaded|last=Gillis|first=Stacy|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2005|isbn=1904764339|location=London|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origins ==
The origins of cyberpunk are rooted in the [[New Wave science fiction]] movement of the 1960s and 70s, where ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'', under the editorship of [[Michael Moorcock]], began inviting and encouraging stories that examined new writing styles, techniques, and [[archetype]]s. Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ ‘NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]&lt;br /&gt;Ballard’s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media — &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot;, &quot;Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown&quot;, &quot;The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race&quot; (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) — paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the &quot;archetypes&quot; popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with &quot;more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60#v=onepage&amp;q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave&lt;/ref&gt;

This had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;. One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:
{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation — cyberpunks and humanists and so forth — [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man’s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian » 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017|date=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ballard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more &quot;realism&quot; to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.

Similarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more &quot;realist&quot; than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.

''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, &quot;[[Johnny Mnemonic]]&quot; helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.

In 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.

He described the idea thus:
{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly “speaking computer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-books-fiction/the-early-life-of-the-word-cyberpunk/|title=The Early Life of the Word &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; - Neon Dystopia|date=13 November 2016|website=NeonDystopia.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Afterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article where he said &quot;About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic “school” would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as “cyberpunks” — Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/12/30/science-fiction-in-the-eighties/526c3a06-f123-4668-9127-33e33f57e313/|title=Science Fiction in the Eighties|first=Gardner|last=Dozois|date=30 December 1984|publisher=|access-date=28 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About that time in 1984, William Gibson's novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk &quot;virtual reality&quot;, with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called &quot;Neuromantics&quot;, a pun on the name of the novel plus &quot;[[New Romantics]]&quot;, a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased [[Michael Swanwick]]'s argument for the term: &quot;the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation ''Neuromancer''&quot;.

Sterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf|title=Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image|website=AthabascaU.ca|access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called ''[[Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology]]'', an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2013/01/review-of-mirrorshades-cyberpunk.html|title=Speculiction...: Review of &quot;Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology&quot; Edited by Bruce Sterling|last=Jesse|date=27 January 2013|website=Speculiction.Blogspot.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' in 1992.

Bookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called ''[[Headcrash]]'', like ''Snow Crash'' a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].

It satirized the genre in this way:
{{quote|...full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements ... They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures. You know, cyberpunks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wc.arizona.edu/papers/91/32/13_1_m.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114070119/http://wc.arizona.edu/papers/91/32/13_1_m.html|url-status=dead|title=Bethke crashes the cyberpunk system - October 8, 1997|archivedate=November 14, 2015|website=wc.arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The impact of cyberpunk, though, has been long-lasting. Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously [[Steampunk]], but also a host of other [[Cyberpunk derivatives]].

== Style and ethos ==
Primary figures in the cyberpunk movement include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Bruce Bethke]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]]. [[Philip K. Dick]] (author of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', from which the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' was adapted) is also seen by some as prefiguring the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/0003637k/project/html/litaut.htm |title=The Cyberpunk Movement&amp;nbsp;– Cyberpunk authors |publisher=[[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute]] |accessdate=2009-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720051349/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/0003637k/project/html/litaut.htm |archivedate=2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blade Runner'' can be seen as a quintessential example of the cyberpunk style and theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;/&gt; [[Video game]]s, [[board games]], and [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, such as ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]'', often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, some trends in [[cyberpunk fashion|fashion]] and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is also featured prominently in [[anime]] and [[manga]] ([[Japanese cyberpunk]]),&lt;ref name=CWCcyber/&gt; with ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' being among the most notable.&lt;ref name=CWCcyber&gt;{{cite book |last=Chaudhuri |first=Shohini |authorlink= |title=Contemporary World Cinema: Europe, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOXoeyesZOIC&amp;pg=PA104 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |year=2005 |page=104 |isbn=0-7486-1799-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from [[hardboiled]] [[detective fiction]], [[film noir]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] prose to describe an often [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] underground side of an electronic society. The genre's vision of a [[Dystopia|troubled future]] is often called the antithesis of the generally [[utopia]]n visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Gibson defined cyberpunk's antipathy towards utopian SF in his 1981 short story &quot;[[The Gernsback Continuum]],&quot; which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward James (historian) |last2=Mendlesohn |first2=Farah |authorlink2=Farah Mendlesohn |title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55wUHXiay-gC&amp;pg=PA221 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003 |page=221 |isbn=0-521-01657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil |authorlink= |title=The Cultures of the New American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bG3H3kxLhU4C&amp;pg=PA159 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2000 |page=159 |isbn=1-57958-288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seed |first=David |authorlink= |title=Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HO_z5WFKwpoC&amp;pg=PA220|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]]|year=2005 |page=220 |isbn=1-4051-1218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place [[online]], in [[cyberspace]], blurring the line between actual and [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberpunk.asia/index.php?lng=us|title=Cyberpunk 2021|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in such work is a direct [[Brain-computer interface|connection]] between the human brain and computer systems. Cyberpunk settings are dystopias with corruption, computers and internet connectivity. Giant, [[multinational corporation]]s have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power.

The economic and technological state of [[Japan]] is a regular theme in the Cyberpunk literature of the '80s. Of Japan's influence on the genre, William Gibson said, &quot;Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberpunk1&quot;/&gt; Cyberpunk is often set in urbanized, artificial landscapes, and &quot;city lights, receding&quot; was used by Gibson as one of the genre's first [[metaphor]]s for cyberspace and virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Neuromancer | url=https://archive.org/details/neuromancer00gibs | url-access=registration | first=William| last=Gibson |date=August 1984 | publisher=Ace Books |page =[https://archive.org/details/neuromancer00gibs/page/69 69]| isbn=0-441-56956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cityscapes of [[Hong Kong]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ags&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader | publisher=Wallflower Press | author=Redmond, Sean | year=2004 | pages=101–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shanghai]]&lt;ref&gt;Sahr Johnny, &quot;Cybercity - Sahr Johnny's Shanghai Dream&quot; ''[[That's Shanghai]]'', October 2005; quoted online by [http://www.xyberia.com/].&lt;/ref&gt; have had major influences in the urban backgrounds, ambiance and settings in many cyberpunk works such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]''. [[Ridley Scott]] envisioned the landscape of cyberpunk [[Los Angeles]] in ''Blade Runner'' to be &quot;Hong Kong on a very bad day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Wheale |first= Nigel |year= 1995 |title= The Postmodern Arts: An Introductory Reader |publisher=Routledge |url= https://books.google.com/?id=8dGfKmubQIgC&amp;pg=PA107 |page= 107 |isbn= 978-0-415-07776-7 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The streetscapes of ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' were based on Hong Kong. Its director [[Mamoru Oshii]] felt that Hong Kong's strange and chaotic streets where &quot;old and new exist in confusing relationships&quot;, fit the theme of the film well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ags&quot; /&gt; Hong Kong's [[Kowloon Walled City]] is particularly notable for its disorganized hyper-urbanization and breakdown in traditional urban planning to be an inspiration to cyberpunk landscapes.

=== Protagonists ===
One of the cyberpunk genre's prototype characters is Case, from Gibson's ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Todd W. |authorlink= |title= Literacy Theory in the Age of the Internet |url= https://archive.org/details/literacyliteracy00todd |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/literacyliteracy00todd/page/34 34] |isbn=0-231-11331-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case is a &quot;console cowboy,&quot; a brilliant hacker who has betrayed his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.

Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. These [[anti-hero]]es—&quot;criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://18hz.deid.net/cyberpunk.htm FAQ file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827210905/http://18hz.deid.net/cyberpunk.htm |date=2005-08-27 }} (from the ''alt.cyberpunk'' Usenet group)&lt;/ref&gt;—call to mind the private eye of detective fiction. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the &quot;[[Punk subculture|punk]]&quot; component of cyberpunk.

=== Society and government ===
Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of cultural revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic [[David Brin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others ''do'' depict [[Orwellian]] accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate [[elite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brin|Brin, David]] ''The Transparent Society'', Basic Books, 1998 [http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738201448 Book link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the [[Internet]]. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the [[World Wide Web]] entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and some social commentators such as [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] began predicting that such networks would eventually form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] &quot;[[The Last Question]],&quot; ''Science Fiction Quarterly'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and Africans. For instance, it is claimed that cyberpunk depicts fantasies that ultimately empower [[masculinity]] using fragmentary and decentered aesthetic that culminate in a masculine genre populated by male outlaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reload: Rethinking Women + Cyberculture|last=Flanagan|first=Mary|last2=Booth|first2=Austin|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0262062275|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also note the absence of any reference to Africa or an African-American character in the quintessential cyberpunk film ''Blade Runner''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; while other films reinforce stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyberpunk Women, Feminism and Science Fiction: A Critical Study|last=Lavigne|first=Carlen|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|year=2013|isbn=9780786466535|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minnesota writer [[Bruce Bethke]] coined the term in 1980 for his short story &quot;Cyberpunk,&quot; which was published in the November 1983 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing Science Fiction Stories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Bethke|Bethke, Bruce]]. &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; ''Amazing Science Fiction Stories'', Vol. 57, No. 4; November 1983 [http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/cpunk.htm Link]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of [[William Gibson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Pat Cadigan]] and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement's chief ideologue, thanks to his [[fanzine]] ''[[Cheap Truth]].'' John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker's significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shirley]].

[[William Gibson]] with his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) is arguably the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction tropes. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as &quot;the archetypal cyberpunk work,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Person&quot;/&gt; ''Neuromancer'' was awarded the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], and [[Philip K. Dick]] Awards. ''[[Count Zero]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' (1988) followed after Gibson's popular debut novel. According to the [[Jargon File]], &quot;Gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/C/cyberpunk.html|title=Jargon File definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brians&quot;&gt;Brians, Paul. &quot;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/neuromancer.html Study Guide for William Gibson: Neuromancer (1984)]&quot; Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, however, some critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]] of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned.&lt;ref&gt;James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th Century'', Oxford University Press, Oxford &amp; New York, 1994. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while ''Neuromancer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s narrator may have had an unusual &quot;voice&quot; for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson's narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated [[Raymond Chandler]], as in his novel ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brians&quot;/&gt; Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers' works—often citing [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], and even [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brians&quot;/&gt; For example, Philip K. Dick's works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eiss|first1=Harry Edwin|isbn=9781443856362|title=Electric sheep slouching towards Bethlehem: speculative fiction in a post modern world|accessdate=26 November 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXYxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR134|date=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influential cyberpunk movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) is based on his book, ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cavallaro|first1=Dani|title=Cyberpunk &amp; Cyberculture: Science Fiction and the Work of William Gibson|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ4cOkg6T-UC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=26 November 2016|isbn=9780485006070|date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth's ''[[Wolfbane (novel)|Wolfbane]]'' (1959) and [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'' (1968).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==== Reception and impact ====
Science-fiction writer [[David Brin]] describes cyberpunk as &quot;the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction.&quot; It may not have attracted the &quot;real punks,&quot; but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] and to the visual arts generally. Although the &quot;self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution&quot; on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the &quot;rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brin]], [http://www.davidbrin.com/matrixarticle.html Review of ''The Matrix''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322014437/http://www.davidbrin.com/matrixarticle.html |date=2008-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]] considers cyberpunk the &quot;supreme literary expression if not of [[postmodernism]], then of [[late capitalism]] itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|title=Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1991|page=419|url=http://fa.mayfirst.org/articles/Jameson_Postmodernism__cultural_logic_late_capitalism.pdf|isbn=1617230022|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124654/http://fa.mayfirst.org/articles/Jameson_Postmodernism__cultural_logic_late_capitalism.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the &quot;original&quot; cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} such as [[George Alec Effinger]]'s ''[[When Gravity Fails]]''. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today's cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims &quot;proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yoo, Paula. &quot;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930218&amp;slug=1686110 Cyberpunk - In Print -- Hacker Generation Gets Plugged Into New Magazine]&quot;, ''Seattle Times''.

The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982)—adapted from Philip K. Dick's ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''—is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called [[replicant]]s are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who &quot;retire&quot; (kill) them. Although ''Blade Runner'' was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerman |first=Judith |authorlink= |title=Retrofitting Blade Runner: Issues in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Philip K.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.

The number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''. Several of Philip K. Dick's works have been adapted to the silver screen. The films ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;ctheory1&quot;/&gt; and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdverdict2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1999&quot;/&gt; both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. These box offices misses significantly slowed the development of cyberpunk as a literary or cultural form although a sequel to the 1982 film ''Blade Runner'' was released in October 2017 with [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role from the original film.

In addition, &quot;[[tech-noir]]&quot; film as a hybrid genre, means a work of combining [[neo-noir]] and science fiction or cyberpunk. It includes many cyberpunk films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Burst City]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;burst&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2012-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121223044/http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |archive-date=2007-11-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[RoboCop (franchise)|Robocop]]'', ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'', ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'', and ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]].''

The [[Japanese cyberpunk]] subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s [[manga]] series ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', with its [[Akira (1988 film)|1988 anime film adaptation]] later popularizing the subgenre. ''Akira'' inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and [[anime]] series such as ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', and ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;polygon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=What is cyberpunk? |url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/8/30/17796680/cyberpunk-2077-history-blade-runner-neuromancer |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early Japanese cyberpunk works include the 1982 film ''[[Burst City]]'', the 1985 [[original video animation]] ''[[Megazone 23]]'', and the 1989 film ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]''.

Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in [[anime]] and [[manga]]. In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's ''Neuromancer,'' whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.

Cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. &quot;The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ruh, Brian (2000), &quot;[http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels Liberating Cels: Forms of the Female in Japanese Cyberpunk Animation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232446/http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels/ |date=2007-09-27 }}.&quot; AnimeResearch.com December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], when one of the young [[Tokyo]] journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, &quot;You see? You see? It is ''Blade Runner'' town.&quot; And it was. It so evidently was.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberpunk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cyberpunk themes have appeared in many anime and manga, including the ground-breaking  ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Ergo Proxy]]'', ''[[Megazone 23]]'', ''[[Neo Tokyo (film)|Neo Tokyo]]'', ''[[Goku Midnight Eye]]'', ''[[Cyber City Oedo 808]]'', ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'', ''[[A.D. Police: Dead End City]]'', ''[[Angel Cop]]'', ''[[Kōji Morimoto|Extra]]'', ''[[Blame!]]'', ''[[Armitage III]]'', ''[[Texhnolyze]]'',  ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and ''[[Psycho-Pass]]''.

''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' (1989) influenced a number of prominent filmmakers.

There are [[:Category:Cyberpunk video games|many]] cyberpunk [[video game]]s. Popular series include the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series, ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and [[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|its spin-offs]], ''[[Deus Ex (series)|Deus Ex]]'' series, ''[[Syndicate (series)|Syndicate]]'' series, and ''[[System Shock]]'' and its [[System Shock 2|sequel]]. Other games, like ''[[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (video game)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', and the ''[[The Matrix (franchise)#Video games|Matrix]]'' series, are based upon genre movies, or [[role-playing game]]s (for instance the various ''[[Shadowrun]]'' games).

Several [[role-playing games|RPGs]] called ''Cyberpunk'' exist: ''Cyberpunk'', ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''Cyberpunk v3'', by [[R. Talsorian Games]], and ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as a module of the [[GURPS]] family of RPGs. ''Cyberpunk 2020'' was designed with the settings of William Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, unlike the approach taken by [[FASA Corporation|FASA]] in producing the transgenre ''[[Shadowrun]]'' game. Both are set in the near future, in a world where [[cyberware|cybernetics]] are prominent. In addition, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] released an RPG named ''[[Cyberspace (role-playing game)|Cyberspace]]'', which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online PDF form. [[CD Projekt Red]] is currently developing ''[[Cyberpunk 2077]],'' a cyberpunk [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] [[open world]] [[Role-playing video game]] (RPG) based on the [[Tabletop role-playing game|tabletop RPG]] ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/everything-we-know-about-cyberpunk-2077/|title=Everything we know about Cyberpunk 2077|work=pcgamer|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-heres-why-cyberpunk-2077-had-to-be-a-first/1100-6459843/|title=E3 2018: Here's Why Cyberpunk 2077 Had To Be A First-Person Game|last=Fillari|first=Alessandro|date=2018-06-14|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/18/cyberpunk-2077-is-cd-projekt-reds-next-game|title=Cyberpunk 2077 is CD Projekt Red's Next Game|date=2012-10-18|website=IGN.com|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the [[United States Secret Service]] raided Steve Jackson Games's headquarters and confiscated all their computers. Officials denied that the target had been the ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'' sourcebook, but Jackson would later write that he and his colleagues &quot;were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript; [...] The Secret Service at first flatly refused to return anything – then agreed to let us copy files, but when we got to their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files – then agreed to make copies for us, but said &quot;tomorrow&quot; every day from March 4 to March 26. On March 26 we received a set of disks which purported to be our files, but the material was late, incomplete and well-nigh useless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/Roleplayer/Roleplayer19/Raid.html SJ Games Raided]&quot;, [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Jackson, Steve]], [[Steve Jackson Games]] website, Friday, 19 April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Jackson Games won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' have a tagline on the front cover, which reads &quot;The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!&quot; Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.

Cyberpunk has also inspired several [[tabletop game|tabletop]], [[miniature wargaming|miniature]] and [[board game]]s such as ''[[Necromunda]]'' by [[Games Workshop]]. ''[[Netrunner]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] introduced in 1996, based on the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' role-playing game. ''[[Tokyo NOVA]]'', debuting in 1993, is a cyberpunk role-playing game that uses [[playing cards]] instead of dice.

Invariably the origin of cyberpunk music lies in the synthesizer-heavy scores of cyberpunk films such as Escape from New York (1981) and Blade Runner (1982) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://shellzine.net/cyberpunk-music-origins-and-evolution/ | title= Cyberpunk Music: Origins and Evolution | publisher=shellzine.net | date=December 26, 2019 | accessdate=February 10, 2020 | author=SHELLZINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. 

[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk. The former has been interpreted as a dystopian&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/exo-mw0002387718 | title=Exo - Gatekeeper | website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=January 3, 2015 | author=Ham, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; critique of [[capitalism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;stylus1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stylus.com/hzwtls | title=Vaporwave: Soundtrack to Austerity | publisher=Stylus.com | date=January 29, 2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2014 | author=Ward, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter as a nostalgic [[retrofuturistic]] revival of aspects of cyberpunk's origins.

Some [[Neo-Futurism]] artworks and cityscapes have been influenced by cyberpunk, such as&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberpunk1&quot;/&gt; the [[Sony Center]] in the [[Potsdamer Platz]] [[public square]] of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suzuki |first=David |authorlink=David Suzuki |title=Good News for a Change:How Everyday People Are Helping the Planet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbvpz6NaZC8C&amp;pg=PA332 |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2003 |page=332 |isbn=1-55054-926-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Society and counterculture ===
Several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as &quot;cyberpunks&quot;, attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.

[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, &quot;post apocalypse&quot;, functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like &quot;tech wear&quot;, &quot;goth ninja&quot; or &quot;tech ninja&quot;. Important designers in this type of fashion{{According to whom|date=January 2015}} are ACRONYM, Demobaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.demobaza.com/ |title=Online Store |publisher=Demobaza |date= |accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Bidjan Saberi]], [[Rick Owens]] and [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]].

The [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[Hong Kong]] (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-new-look-at-kowloon-walled-city-the-internets-favorite-cyberpunk-slum|title=A New Look at Kowloon Walled City, the Internet's Favorite Cyberpunk Slum|publisher=|date=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Cyberpunk derivatives}}
As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is &quot;[[steampunk]],&quot; which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Berry, &quot;Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,&quot; ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another subgenre is &quot;[[biopunk]]&quot; (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].

Cyberpunk works have been described as well-situated within [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;McHale, Brian (1991). &quot;POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.&quot; in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''. Durham, N.C.: [[Duke University Press]], pp. 308–323&lt;/ref&gt;
