'''Conservatism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[social philosophy]] promoting traditional social institutions in the context of [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. The central tenets of conservatism include [[tradition]], [[organic society]], [[hierarchy]], [[authority]], and [[property rights]].{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=68}} Conservatives seek to preserve a range of institutions such as [[religion]], [[parliamentary government]], and property rights, with the aim of emphasizing [[social dynamics|social stability]] and continuity.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=69}} The more traditional elements—[[reactionaries]]—oppose [[modernism]] and seek a return to &quot;the way things were&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Iain; McMillan, Alistair (2009). &quot;Conservatism&quot;. ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' (3rd ed.). Oxford University Press. &quot;Sometimes [conservatism] has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time. It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period&quot;. {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133435/conservatism|title=Conservatism (political philosophy)|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Z. Muller|title=Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought from David Hume to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F7i5u4sOtgC&amp;pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=26|quote=Terms related to 'conservative' first found their way into political discourse in the title of the French weekly journal, ''Le Conservateur'', founded in 1818 by François-René de Chateaubriand with the aid of Louis de Bonald.|isbn=978-0-691-03711-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the period of [[Bourbon Restoration]] that sought to roll back the policies of the [[French Revolution]]. Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has since been used to describe [[#Forms|a wide range of views]]. There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution, but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=978-0-415-32684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: &quot;Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22&amp;num=10|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal conservatism ===
{{main|Liberal conservatism}}
[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&amp;pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108–109, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.

[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mair&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]].

=== Libertarian conservatism ===
{{main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies most prominently within the [[United States]] which combine [[libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its four main branches are [[constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they favor more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].

[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nlm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;int&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention.

Many conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work.

=== Fiscal conservatism ===
{{main|Fiscal conservatism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|2009 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]] as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D. C.]]
[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109|title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure|first=Robert M.|last=Freeman|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Edmund Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== National and traditional conservatism ===

[[National conservatism]] is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism as well as upholding cultural and ethnic identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary Of Public Administration|last=Mandal|first=V.C.|year=2007|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=|isbn=978-81-7625-784-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Hs0xJORVIHwC/page/n312 306]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Hs0xJORVIHwC|quote=National conservatism -inpublisher:icon.|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while not being outspokenly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] or supporting a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jason (August 23, 2016).

National conservatism is heavily oriented towards the traditional [[family]] and social stability as well as in favour of limiting [[immigration]]. As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: &quot;[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041121224135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions – conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite], National Review, June 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].

Traditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–875&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditionalists have embraced the labels &quot;[[reactionary]]&quot; and &quot;[[counterrevolution]]ary&quot;, defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Having a hierarchical view of society, many traditionalist conservatives, including a few Americans, defend the [[monarchy|monarchical]] political structure as the most natural and beneficial social arrangement.

=== Cultural and social conservatism ===
{{main|Cultural conservatism|Social conservatism}}
[[Cultural conservative]]s support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |first=James |last=Seaton |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term &quot;cultural conservative&quot; may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

[[Social conservatism]] is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

A second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.

Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the phrase) in many countries generally favour the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.&quot; President George H. W. Bush, {{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/ghwbush.htm |title=Positive Atheism (since 1995) Join the Struggle Against Anti-Atheist Bigotry! |accessdate=2009-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228202939/http://positiveatheism.org/writ/ghwbush.htm |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially militant atheism, [[secularism]] and the [[separation of church and state]];&lt;ref name=&quot;MA1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=VayGAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22conservatism%22+%22militant+atheism%22|title=The World &amp; I.: Volume 1, Issue 5|quote=militant atheism was incompatible with conservatism|author=The World &amp; I.: Volume 1, Issue 5|publisher=Washington Times Corp.|accessdate =19 August 2011| year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MA2&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=9dgvDn9hoe0C&amp;pg=PA264&amp;q=social%20conservatism%20militant%20atheism|title=The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right|quote=In addition, conservative Christians often endorsed far-right remines as the lesser of two evils, especially when confronted with militant atheism in the USSR.|author1=Peter Davies |author2=Derek Lynch |publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|accessdate =19 August 2011| isbn = 978-0-415-21494-0| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Secularism&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=SRrwirez3fQC&amp;pg=PA57|title=Religious America, Secular Europe?: A Theme and Variations|quote=If anything the reverse is true: moral conservatives continue to oppose secular liberals on a wide range of issues.|author1=Peter L.

Most conservatives in the United States support the [[death penalty]].
=== Defending inequality===
In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism, some political theorists such as [[Corey Robin]] define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]]. From this perspective, conservatism is less an attempt to uphold traditional institutions and more &quot;a meditation on—and theoretical rendition of—the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henning Finseraas, &quot;What if Robin Hood is a social conservative? How the political response to increasing inequality depends on party polarization.&quot; ''Socio-Economic Review'' 8.2 (2010): 283-306.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some conservatives may argue that they are seeking less to protect their own power than they are seeking to protect &quot;inalienable rights&quot; and promote norms and rules that they believe should stand timeless and eternal, applying to each citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/what-does-conservatism-stand-for|title=What does conservatism stand for?|last=Rooksby|first=Ed|date=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Conservative-Mind/130199/|title=The Conservative Mind|last=Robin|first=Corey|date=8 January 2012|work=|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious conservatism {{anchor|Religious conservatism}} ===
{{see also|Christian right|Religious fundamentalism}}
[[File:Marche pour la vie 2012 - 6.jpg|thumb|2012 [[March for Life (Paris)|March for Life]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]]]
Religious conservatism principally apply the teachings of particular religions to politics, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times by having those teachings influence laws.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Margaret L., Taylor, Howard Francis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 ''Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society''] Cengage Learning, 4th Ed. (2005), pp. 469–470. {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, [[LGBT]] behavior (or, in certain cases, identity), drug use,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;So Christians do not approve of the taking of illegal drugs, including most recreational drugs, especially those which can alter the mind and make people incapable of praying or being alert to God.&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020142532/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml |date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual activity outside of marriage. In some cases, conservative values are grounded in religious beliefs, and conservatives seek to increase the role of religion in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, David L. (2005). &quot;Genesis and Family Values&quot;. ''Journal of Biblical Literature''. '''124''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paternalistic conservatism ===
{{main|Paternalistic conservatism}}
Paternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other.{{sfn|Heywood|2013|p=34}} There is particular emphasis on the [[Noblesse oblige|paternalistic obligation]] of those who are [[Social privilege|privileged]] and [[wealth]]y to the [[Poverty|poorer parts of society]]. Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen as an outgrowth of [[traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}}

It stresses the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support of limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation of markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–108&quot;&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, US: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalistic conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the [[United Kingdom]] under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s &quot;[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]&quot; [[Toryism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake.

The Tory Party: its policies, divisions and future. Penguin, 1978. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Boris Johnson]] were or are one nation conservatives.

In [[Germany]], during the 19th-century [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age. Chancellor [[Leo von Caprivi]] promoted a conservative agenda called the &quot;New Course&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Alden Nichols. ''Germany after Bismarck, the Caprivi era, 1890–1894: Issue 5''. Harvard University Press, 1958. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the administration of President [[William Howard Taft]] was a progressive conservative and he described himself as &quot;a believer in progressive conservatism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York, US: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Dwight D.

Kutler, ''Eisenhower: a centenary assessment''. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], a variety of conservative governments have been part of the [[Red tory]] tradition, with Canada's former major conservative party being named the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] from 1942 to 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Segal 2011. pp. 113–148&quot;&gt;Hugh Segal.

Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2001. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements were prominent in the same era as [[fascism]], with which it sometimes clashed. Although both ideologies shared core values such as nationalism and had common enemies such as [[communism]] and [[materialism]], there was nonetheless a contrast between the traditionalist nature of authoritarian conservatism and the revolutionary, [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] and populist nature of fascism—thus it was common for authoritarian conservative regimes to suppress rising fascist and [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] [[National Socialism (disambiguation)|movements]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power for the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialists]] in Austria, which was marked by the assassination of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].

Sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] has examined the class basis of right-wing extremist politics in the 1920–1960 era. He reports:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist... The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Lipset, &quot;Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'&quot; ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
{{Toryism|related}}
In Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660–1688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642–1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.

Conservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633–1695), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797). Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=Jerry Z.|title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present|url=https://archive.org/details/conservatismanth00mull|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolin|first1=Sheldon S.|title=Hume and Conservatism|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2 September 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=999–1016|doi=10.2307/1951007|jstor=1951007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Morton Auerbach|title=The Conservative Illusion|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AuerbachMMorton-1959?View=FindIt|publisher=Columbia University Press (1959)|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative. He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765–1783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive. He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=52–54|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|page=41|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was a leading theorist in his day, finding extreme idealism (either Tory or Whig) an endangerment to broader liberties and (like Hume) rejecting abstract reason as an unsound guide for political theory. Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.

===== Revival =====
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]
Shortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke, but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678–1751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in &quot;Taxation No Tyranny&quot;). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759–1806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was &quot;aggressively imperialist&quot;. The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

Conservatism evolved after 1820, embracing free trade in 1846 and a commitment to democracy, especially under Disraeli. The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, &quot;Political Thought&quot;, in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only &quot;really democratic party of England&quot; and devoted to the interests of the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818–1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&amp;pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=978-0-521-49729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788–1850)]]
Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Burke, there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on &quot;conservation&quot;. The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the &quot;Peelites&quot; (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the inter-war period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ball, &quot;Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)&quot;, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914–1951'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I. (1997). &quot;[https://search.proquest.com/openview/b8a69e791efde94deca750b6521a4046/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1819397 Rationalisation and Britain's industrial Malaise: The interwar years revisited]&quot;. ''Journal of European Economic History''. '''26''' (1): 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Liberal Party vied with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for control of the left. After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government (1945–1951) under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalization of industry and the promotion of social welfare. The Conservatives generally accepted those policies until the 1980s.

[[File:Margaret Thatcher stock portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]] (1925–2013), under whose leadership the Conservative Party has shifted their economic policies to the right as well as [[Thatcherism]]]]
In the 1980s, the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], guided by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, reversed many of Labour's programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|last=McLean|first=Iain|last2=McMillan|first2=Laistair|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920516-5|location=|page=364|quote=In the developed world neoliberalism is often coupled with Thatcherism [...].|via=|date=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party also adopt [[soft euroscepticism|soft eurosceptic]] politics, and oppose [[Federal Europe]]. Other conservative political parties, such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP, founded in 1993), [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP, founded in 1971), began to appear, although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster ({{as of |2014 |lc = on}}, the DUP comprises the largest political party in the ruling coalition in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]), and since 2017 the DUP has provided support for the Conservative [[Second May ministry|minority government]].

==== France ====
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821)]]
Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.

Eventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support. Conservatives were the first to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with [[liberalism]] and the Revolution in France.&lt;ref&gt;ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
{{main|Conservatism in Germany}}
Conservatism developed alongside nationalism in Germany, culminating in Germany's victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the creation of the unified [[German Empire]] in 1871 and the simultaneous rise of [[Otto von Bismarck]] on the European political stage. Bismarck's &quot;balance of power&quot; model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His &quot;revolutionary conservatism&quot; was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s. According to [[Kees van Kersbergen]] and Barbara Vis, his strategy was: {{Quote|[G]ranting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kersbergen|first1=Kees van|last2=Vis|first2=Barbara|title=Comparative Welfare State Politics: Development, Opportunities, and Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=38|isbn=978-1-107-65247-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Bismarck also enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Robert Laurence|last2=Vaudagna|first2=Maurizio|title=The American Century in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeoqKSxiOu4C&amp;pg=PA226|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=226|isbn=978-0-8014-4075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory after he left office in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Richard|year=2003|title=From the Beer Halls to the Halls of Power: The Cult of Bismarck and the Legitimization of a New German Right, 1898–1945|url=|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=543–560|doi=10.2307/1432746|jstor=1432746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, [[agrarianism|agrarian movements]] faded and was supplanted by a more command-based economy and forced social integration. Though [[Adolf Hitler]] succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists, prominent traditionalists openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia, genocide and attacks on organized religion, including [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Henning von Tresckow]], Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] and the monarchist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]].

More recently, the work of conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] leader and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] helped bring about [[German reunification]], along with the closer [[European integration]] in the form of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].

Today, German conservatism is often associated with politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose tenure has been marked by attempts to save the common European currency ([[Euro]]) from demise. The German conservatives are divided under Merkel due to the refugee crisis in Germany and many conservatives in the [[CDU/CSU]] oppose the refugee and migrant policies developed under Merkel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==== United States ====
{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}
American conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the [[United States]] that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian]] values, [[economic liberalism]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of [[Western culture]]. [[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.

The major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]], as long as it conforms to conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]], and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Schneider, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IVD3z0PuTRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution]'' &quot;The label (conservatism) is in frequent use and has come to stand for a skepticism, at times an outright hostility, toward government social policies; a muscular foreign policy combined with a patriotic nationalism; a defense of traditional Christian religious values; and support for the free market economic system.&quot;, &quot;Within the conservative disposition in America, there are inherent contradictions between supporters of social order and tradition and supporters of individual freedom.&quot;, (2009) pp. 4–9, 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Thompson, ''Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice'' p. 7: &quot;Historically...social justice became associated with liberalism in which equality is the ideal.&quot;, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4422-1604-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical conservatism in different countries ===
{{further|Political spectrum|Right-wing politics}}
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term &quot;conservative&quot; is unique to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alan Ware, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom retained viable conservative parties into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ware said that Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Spain, and the United States had no conservative parties, although they had either Christian democrats or liberals as major right-wing parties. Canada, Ireland and Portugal had right-wing political parties that defied categorization: the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]; [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]] and [[Progressive Democrats]] in Ireland; and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the [[Swiss People's Party]] has moved to the extreme right and is no longer considered to be conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Flecker, Jörg.

[[Klaus von Beyme]], who developed the method of party categorization, found that no modern Eastern European parties could be considered conservative, although the communist and communist-successor parties had strong similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul G.

In Italy, which was united by liberals and radicals (''[[Risorgimento]]''), liberals, not conservatives, emerged as the party of the right.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. ''Modern Italy: a political history''. University of Michigan Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10895-4}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, conservatives merged into a new Christian democratic party in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Daalder, Hans and Irwin, Galen A. ''Politics in the Netherlands: how much change?'' Routledge, 1989. {{ISBN|0-7146-3361-5}} pp. 154–157&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria, Germany, Portugal and Spain, conservatism was transformed into and incorporated into fascism or the [[Far-right politics|far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn, Martin. ''Fascists and conservatives''. Routledge, 1990. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, all Japanese parties were merged into a single fascist party.

[[Louis Hartz]] explained the absence of conservatism in Australia or the United States as a result of their settlement as radical or liberal fragments of Great Britain. Although he said English Canada had a negligible conservative influence, subsequent writers claimed that [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]] opposed to the American Revolution brought a Tory ideology into Canada. Hartz explained conservatism in Quebec and Latin America as a result of their settlement as feudal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, Katherine. ''Political thought in Canada: an intellectual history''.

Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''.

==== Belgium ====
Having its roots in the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]], the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian People's Party]] retained a conservative edge through the twentieth century, supporting the king in the [[Royal Question]], supporting [[nuclear family]] as the cornerstone of society, defending Christian education, and opposing [[euthanasia]]. The Christian People's Party dominated politics in post-war Belgium. In 1999, the party's support collapsed, and it became the country's fifth-largest party.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire.

==== Canada ====
{{main|Conservatism in Canada}}
Canada's conservatives had their roots in the loyalists Tories who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the &quot;[[Family Compact]]&quot; in Ontario and the &quot;[[Chateau Clique]]&quot; in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar. ''Conservative parties and right-wing politics in North America: reaping the benefits of an ideological victory?''. Germany: VS Verlag, 2003. {{ISBN|978-3-8100-3812-8}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the party was known as the Progressive Conservatives until 2003, when the national party merged with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Francisco. ''Populism and the mirror of democracy''. London: Verso, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85984-489-2}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960 and in a close alliance with English Canadian business elites and the Catholic Church. This period, known as the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], ended with the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the party went into terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John Frederick. ''Debts to pay: the future of federalism in Quebec''. Toronto: James Lorimer &amp; Company, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-55028-814-8}} pp. 57, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party added more conservative policies.

==== Colombia ====
{{main|Conservatism in Colombia}}
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833–1837 administration. While the term &quot;liberal&quot; had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as &quot;conservative liberals&quot; and their opponents as &quot;red liberals&quot;. From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;Osterling, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
Founded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''Højre'' (literally &quot;[[Right-wing politics|Right&quot;]]). The conservative party led the government coalition from 1982 to 1993. The party was a junior partner in coalition with the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-214-5}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party. The party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power. A liberal cultural policy dominated during the post-war period. However, by the 1990s, disagreements regarding immigrants from entirely different cultures ignited a conservative backlash.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Støvring, &quot;The Turn from Cultural Radicalism to National Conservatism: Cultural Policy in Denmark.&quot; ''Telos'' 2009.148 (2009) pp. 54–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan.

==== France ====
{{see also|Gaullism|Conservatism in France}}
Conservatism in France focused on the rejection of the secularism of the French Revolution, support for the role of the Catholic Church and the restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;E.L.

Mettenich: Guizot: The Catholic Church In The Nineteenth Century'' (1923) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.461719 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchist cause was on the verge of victory in the 1870s, but then collapsed because the proposed king refused to fly the tri-colored flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Price|title=A Concise History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjB2-RnWUwC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=225|isbn=978-0-521-84480-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious tensions heightened in the 1890–1910 era, but moderated after the spirit of unity in fighting the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Larkin, ''Religion, politics and preferment in France since 1890: La Belle Epoque and its legacy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme form of conservatism characterized the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] of 1940–1944 with heightened antisemitism, opposition to individualism, emphasis on family life and national direction of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hoffmann, &quot;The Vichy Circle of French Conservatives&quot; in Hoffmann, ''Decline or Renewal?

Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic and emphasized tradition, order and the regeneration of France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, &quot;The Parti républicain de la Liberté and the Reconstruction of French Conservatism, 1944–1951&quot;, ''French History'' (1993) 7#2 pp. 183–204&lt;/ref&gt; Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of conservative groups, their lack of stability and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization. Conservatism has been the major political force in France since the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, Peter and Ryn, Claes G. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0576-8}} p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, post-war French conservatism was formed around the personality of a leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]]; and did not draw on traditional French conservatism, but on the [[Bonapartism]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan.

==== Greece ====
The main inter-war conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported [[Greek monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] and opposed the [[Second Hellenic Republic|republican]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]]. Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936–1941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called &quot;Centrist Interlude&quot; in 1950–1952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963—after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967–1974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''. Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-8447-3434-7}} pp. 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Greeks]], a newly formed political party in [[Greece]], has also supported conservatism, particularly [[National conservatism|national]] and [[religious conservatism]]. The Founding Declaration of the Independent Greeks strongly emphasises in the preservation of the Greek state and its [[sovereignty]], the [[Greek people]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anexartitoiellines.gr/files/idritiki%20diakirixi.pdf Founding Declaration of Independent Greeks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iceland ====
Founded in 1924 as the [[Conservative Party (Iceland)|Conservative Party]], Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929 after the merger with the [[Liberal Party (Iceland, historical)|Liberal Party]]. From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

==== Luxembourg ====
Luxembourg's major [[Christian democratic]] conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS), was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914 and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg, and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Derek W. ''A Dictionary of European History and Politics, 1945–1995''. London: Pearson, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-582-25874-7}} p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally &quot;[[Right-wing politics|right&quot;]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884, when parliamentarian government was first practised. It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state, and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

The [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP or UDC) was formed from the 1971 merger of the [[Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents|Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens]], formed in 1917 and the smaller Swiss Democratic Party, formed in 1942. The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''. New York: Garland, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8153-2930-X}} p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], a non-Swiss lobby group based in the United States has accused them of manipulating issues such as immigration, Swiss neutrality and welfare benefits, awakening antisemitism and racism.&lt;ref&gt;The Stephen Roth Institute. ''Anti-semitism worldwide'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8032-5943-3}} p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe]] has called the SVP &quot;extreme right&quot;, although some scholars dispute this classification. For instance, Hans-Georg Betz describes it as &quot;populist radical right&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hainsworth, pp. 44, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The SVP is the largest party since 2003.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
According to historian James Sack, English conservatives celebrate [[Edmund Burke]] as their intellectual father.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sack, &quot;The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt; English Conservatism Confronts its Past, 1806–1829&quot; (1987) 623–640.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was affiliated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] which eventually became the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], but the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is generally thought to derive from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]] and the MPs of the modern conservative party are still frequently referred to as Tories.

=== Modern conservatism in different countries ===
While conservatism has been seen as an appeal to traditional, hierarchical society, some writers such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] see it as situational. Under this definition, conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop and Lovell, pp. 163–166&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{main|Conservatism in Australia}}
The [[Liberal Party of Australia]] adheres to the principles of [[social conservatism]] and [[liberal conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Raphael|title=Tackling Health Inequalities: Lessons from International Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zjh4lQAbPrYC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-412-0|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is liberal in the sense of economics. Other conservative parties are the [[National Party of Australia]], a sister party of the Liberals, [[Family First Party]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]], [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]], [[Australian Conservatives]], and the [[Katter's Australian Party]].

The second largest party in the country is the [[Australian Labor Party]] and its dominant faction is [[Labor Right]], a [[socially conservative]] element. Australia undertook significant economic reform under the Labor Party in the mid-1980s. Consequently, issues like protectionism, welfare reform, privatization and deregulation are no longer debated in the political space as they are in Europe or North America. Moser and Catley explain: &quot;In America, 'liberal' means left-of-center, and it is a pejorative term when used by conservatives in adversarial political debate. In Australia, of course, the conservatives are in the Liberal Party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Mosler|author2=Robert Catley|title=America and Americans in Australia|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://archive.org/details/americaamericans0000mosl|url-access=registration|year=1998|page=[https://archive.org/details/americaamericans0000mosl/page/83 83]|isbn=978-0-275-96252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupp points out that, &quot;[the] decline in English influences on Australian reformism and radicalism, and appropriation of the symbols of Empire by conservatives continued under the Liberal Party leadership of Sir [[Robert Menzies]], which lasted until 1966&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Jupp|title=The English in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n63TaXC5TpEC&amp;pg=PA172|year=2004|page=172|isbn=978-0-521-54295-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It promotes cultural nationalism, [[Hindu Nationalism]], an aggressive foreign policy against Pakistan and a conservative social and fiscal policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abhilasha Kumari|author2=Sabina Kidwai|title=Crossing the Sacred Line: Women's Search for Political Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urvvwXU_ZQkC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=83|isbn=978-81-250-1434-8 |quote=propounds and extends the ideology of cultural nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
After World War II, in [[Italy]] the conservative parties were mainly represented by the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, which government form the foundation of the Republic until the party's dissolution in 1994. Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.

In 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]], [[2001 Italian general election|2001]] and [[2008 Italian general election|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.

Besides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi formed a new party, which is a rebirth of [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]], thuds founding a new conservative movement. Alfano served as [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[2018 Italian general election|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the current [[right-wing populist]] government.

==== Russia ====
Under [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Russian conservatism is unique in some respects as it supports [[Economic interventionism|Economic intervention]] with a [[mixed economy]], with a strong [[Russian nationalism|nationalist sentiment]] and [[social conservatism]] with its views being largely [[Right-wing populism|populist]]. Russian conservatism as a result opposes [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals such as the aforementioned concept of [[economic liberalism]] found in other conservative movements around the world. Putin has as a result promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Laruelle, &quot;[https://www.academia.edu/download/49116221/Russian_Review-Izborskii_Klub.pdf The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}.&quot; ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626–644.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Sirke Mäkinen, &quot;Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.&quot; ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woods, &quot;How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order&quot; [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm ''Christian Today'' March 3, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, ''The New York Times'' reports in September 2016 how that Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, &quot;In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower&quot;, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''New York Times'' Sept 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=&quot;A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community, or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism, and women's and gay rights.&quot;|sign=|source=Andrew Higgins ([[The New York Times]]: In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower)}}

==== South Korea ====
{{ain|Conservatism in South Korea}}
[[South Korea]]'s major conservative party, the [[Liberty Korea Party]], has changed its form throughout its history. First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963–1980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'état and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[1963 South Korean presidential election|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[2007 South Korean presidential election|2007]].

==== United States ====
{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}
[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–1989), whose [[Reagan Doctrine]] has reshaped the Republican Party]]
The meaning of &quot;conservatism&quot; in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo (2011) notes, &quot;what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, &quot;20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy&quot;, ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives and they played a key role in the [[conservative coalition]] that largely controlled domestic policy in Congress from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixicrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, &quot;...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.&quot;, The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conservative Democrat]]s continued to have influence in the US politics until 1994's [[Republican Revolution]], when the American South shifted from solid Democrat to solid Republican, while maintaining its conservative values.

Major priorities within American conservatism include support for the [[traditional family]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], the [[right to bear arms]], [[Christian values]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of &quot;[[Western civilization]] from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GregorySchneider&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution|last=Schneider|first=Gregory|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=xii|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conservatives and libertarians favor [[small government]], low taxes, limited regulation and free enterprise. Some social conservatives see traditional social values threatened by secularism, so they support [[school prayer]] and [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|oppose abortion]] and [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=Social&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;q=social%20conservatism%20abortion%20marriage|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|accessdate=19 January 2012|author=Cal Jillson|date=22 February 2011|quote=Social conservatives focus on moral or values issues, such as abortion, marriage, school prayer, and judicial appointments.|isbn=978-0-203-82941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoconservatives]] want to expand American ideals throughout the world and show a strong support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Frohnen, ed.

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of &quot;godless communism&quot;, which Reagan later labeled an &quot;[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Gottfried, ''Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right'', p. 9, &quot;Post-war conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism.&quot; (2009); Gottfried, ''Theologies and moral concern'' (1995) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Reagan administration]], conservatives also supported the so-called &quot;[[Reagan Doctrine]]&quot; under which the US as part of a Cold War strategy provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist. The Reagan administration also adopted [[neoliberalism]] and [[trickle-down economics]], as well as [[Reaganomics]], which made for economic growth in the 1980s, fueled by trillion-dollar deficits.

Other modern conservative positions include opposition to [[big government]] and [[opposition to environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, ''The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism'', Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349–385&lt;/ref&gt; On average, American conservatives desire tougher foreign policies than liberals do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23736 Peter Hays Gries, ''The Politics of American Foreign Policy: How Ideology Divides Liberals and Conservatives over Foreign Affairs'' (Stanford, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic liberalism]], [[deregulation]] and [[social conservatism]] are main principles of the Republican Party.

The [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, has proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas. Their stated goals include rigorous adherence to the US constitution, lower taxes, and opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care. Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the US House of Representatives in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism'' (2012) pp. 45–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-12030-503544.html|title=Katie Couric Interviews Tea Party Leaders|date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV section|talk=Psychology|date=October 2019}}
Following the Second World War, psychologists conducted research into the different motives and tendencies that account for ideological differences between left and right. The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test. This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings{{clarify|date=July 2019}} have been confirmed by further empirical research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jost, J.J 2003&quot;&gt;Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., &amp; Sulloway, F.J. (2003).

''Psychological Bulletin'', 129:(3), pp. 339–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is &quot;fear of uncertainty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. (Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism and its manifestations in decision-making.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jost, J.J 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2019.04.001|last1=Chan|first1=EY|last2=Ilicic|first2=J|year=2019|title=Political ideology and brand attachment|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|volume=36|issue=4|pages=TBD}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits &quot;might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty&quot;. The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, liberals are more tolerant of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml|title=Researchers help define what makes a political conservative|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) on his RWA scale.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was echoed by Adorno. A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubinstein|first1=G.|doi=10.1177/0022022196272005|title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1996|volume=27|pages=216–230|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions: &quot;The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. &quot;Is political conservatism synonymous with authoritarianism?.&quot; ''The Journal of Social Psychology'' 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22).

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[social dominance orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views and opposition to social engineering to promote equality,&lt;ref name=&quot;pratto&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratto|first1=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=67|pages=741–763|issue=4|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Pratto's findings have been highly controversial{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} as Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. However, [[David J. Schneider]] argued for a more complex relationships between the three factors, writing &quot;correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted, suggesting that the conservatism–prejudice link is caused by SDO&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider, Guilford Press, 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-59385-193-4}} p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative political theorist [[Kenneth Minogue]] criticized Pratto's work, saying: &quot;It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-7102-0008-2}} pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals, though &quot;anti-Black affect had essentially no relationship with political conservatism at any level of educational or intellectual sophistication&quot;. They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;sidanius96&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476|last1=Sidanius|first1=J|last2=Pratto|first2=F|last3=Bobo|first3=L|year=1996|title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70|issue=3|pages=476–490|url=http://www.scholar.harvard.edu/files/bobo/files/1996_racism_conservatism_affirmative_action_and_journal_of_personality_and_social_psychology.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.1114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 research report found that conservatives are happier than liberals and that—as income inequality increases—this difference in relative happiness increases because conservatives (more than liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Napier|first1=J.L.|last2=Jost|first2=J.T.|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02124.x|title=Why Are Conservatives Happier Than Liberals?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=6|pages=565–572|year=2008|pmid=18578846|pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
