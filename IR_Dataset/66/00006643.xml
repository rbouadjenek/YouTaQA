'''Croquet''' ({{lang|fr|croquêt}}) is a [[sport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croquet.org.uk/ The Croquet Association (CA)], the national governing body for the sport of Croquet in England&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordcroquet.com/ Oxford Croquet.com], &quot;Croquet is a satisfying sport utilising tactics and touch in equal measure&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that involves hitting wooden or plastic [[ball]]s with a mallet through hoops (often called &quot;wickets&quot; in the United States) embedded in a grass playing court.

==History==
[[File:Pall Mall - Project Gutenberg eText 14315.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Paille-maille]] (pall-mall) illustrated in ''Old English Sports, Pastimes and Customs'', published 1891. Original image by Lauthier, 1717]]

The oldest document to bear the word ''croquet'' with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by [[Isaac Spratt]] in November 1856 with the Stationers' Company in [[London]].  This record is now in the [[Public Record Office]]. In 1868, the first croquet all-comers meet was held at [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Gloucestershire]] and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at [[Wimbledon, London]].

Regardless when and by what route it reached [[England]] and the [[British Empire|British colonies]] in its recognizable form, croquet is, like [[golf]], [[pall-mall]], [[trucco]], and [[Kolven#History|kolven]], among the later forms of [[ground billiards]], which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the [[Late Middle Ages]], with roots in [[classical antiquity]], including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with [[Ball (sports)|balls]] and [[mallet]]s or other striking sticks (some more akin to modern [[field hockey]] sticks).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamos 1999&quot;&gt;{{Shamos 1999|117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clare&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

In the book ''Queen of Games: The History of Croquet'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Nicky |title=Queen of Games: The History of Croquet |publisher=George Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1991 |isbn=0-297-81176-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet, which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas.

===First origin theory===

The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to [[Great Britain|Britain]] from [[France]] during the 1630–1685 reign of [[Charles II of England]], and was played under the name of ''{{lang|enm|paille-maille}}'' (among other spellings, today usually ''pall-mall''), derived ultimately from Latin words for 'ball and mallet' (the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game, ''{{lang|frm|[[jeu de mail]]}}'').  This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', dated 1877.

In his 1810 book ''The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'', Joseph Strutt described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Pale-maille is a game wherein a round [[Boxwood|box&amp;#91;wood&amp;#93;]] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron, which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed upon, wins.  It is to be observed, that there are two of these arches, that is one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James's Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sports and Pastimes of the People of England |publisher=Methuen |first= Joseph |last=Strutt |page=[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125012252157/page/n177 96] |date=1810 |via=Internet Archive |url= https://archive.org/details/gri_33125012252157 |access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the name ''pall-mall'' and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere (France and Italy), the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century.  Some other [[Early modern era|early modern]] sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance (as in golf); however, an image in Strutt's 1801 book shows a croquet-like [[ground billiards]] game (balls on ground, hoop, bats, and peg) being played over a {{em|short}}, garden-sized distance.  The image's caption describes the game as &quot;a curious ancient pastime&quot;, confirming that croquet games were not new in early-19th-century England.
[[File:EarlyCroquetSportsofPeopleofEnglandStrutt.jpg|thumb|Early croquet-like game from ''The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'', first published 1801. Hoop, peg, and two players with balls clearly shown.  Such implements in [[ground billiards]] games date to [[classical antiquity]].]]

In [[Samuel Johnson]]'s 1755 dictionary, his definition of &quot;pall-mall&quot; clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: &quot;A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z3kKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA519&amp;dq=pelmel#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title= A dictionary of the English language |first1= Samuel | first2= John |last2= Walker |first3= Robert S. |last3= Jameson |page=519 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |year= 1828|author1= Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game.

===Second origin theory===

The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from [[Ireland]] during the 1850s, perhaps after being brought there from [[Brittany]], where a similar game was played on the beaches. Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169. By no later than the early 15th century, the game ''{{lang|frm|jeu de mail}}'' (itself ancestral to pall-mall and perhaps to indoor [[Cue sports#History|billiards]]) was popular in France, including in the courts of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in the 16th century and [[Louis XIV]] of the 17th.

At least one version of it, ''{{lang|frm|rouët}}'' ('wheel') was a multi-ball lawn game.  Records show a game called &quot;crookey&quot;, similar to croquet, being played at [[Castlebellingham]] in County Louth, Ireland, in 1834, which was introduced to [[Galway]] in 1835 and played on the bishop's palace garden, and in the same year to the genteel Dublin suburb of Kingstown (today [[Dún Laoghaire]]) where it was first spelt as &quot;croquet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'', 8 August 2009, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no pre-1858 Irish document that describes the way game was played, in particular there is no reference to the distinctive croquet stroke,&lt;ref name=&quot;prichard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Prichard |first=D. M. C. |title=The History of Croquet |publisher=Cassell |date=1981 |isbn=0-304-30759-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is described below under &quot;Variations: Association&quot;. The noted croquet historian Dr Prior, in his book of 1872, makes the categoric statement &quot;One thing only is certain: it is from Ireland that croquet came to England and it was on the lawn of the late Lord Lonsdale that it was first played in this country.&quot; This was about 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Brief History of Croquet in Ireland |first1=Clive |last1=Martin |first2=Simon |last2=Williams |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Jaques apparently claimed in a letter to [[Arthur Lillie]] in 1873 that he had himself seen the game played in Ireland, writing &quot;I made the implements and published directions (such as they were) before Mr. Spratt [mentioned above] introduced the subject to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Croquet: Its History, Rules, and Secrets |first= Arthur |last=Lillie |page=29 |publisher=Longmans, Green |date=1897 |via=Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=irBDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29 |access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the truth of the matter, Jaques certainly played an important role in popularising the game, producing editions of the rules in 1857, 1860, and 1864.

===Heyday and decline===

Croquet became highly popular as a social pastime in England during the 1860s. It was enthusiastically adopted and promoted by the [[Arthur Algernon Capell, 6th Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] who held lavish croquet parties at [[Cassiobury House]], his stately home in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], and the Earl even launched his own ''Cassiobury'' brand croquet set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url= http://www.watfordcroquet.org.uk/history.php |work=WatfordCroquet.org.uk |publisher=Watford Cassiobury Croquet Club |access-date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Mayne |title=Croquet, etc |date=1869 |page=46 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bxVdAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Croquet%2C%20etc.&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |access-date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1867, Jaques had printed 65,000 copies of his ''Laws and Regulations'' of the game. It quickly spread to other [[English language|Anglophone]] countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]]. No doubt one of the attractions was that the game could be played by both sexes; this also ensured a certain amount of adverse comment.

[[File:Män och kvinnor spelar krocket framför hus på Lidingö - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0040765.jpg|thumb|Croquet players in Sweden, early 20th century.]]
By the late 1870s, however, croquet had been eclipsed by another fashionable game, [[tennis|lawn tennis]], and many of the newly created croquet clubs, including the All England Club at Wimbledon, converted some or all of their lawns into [[tennis court]]s. 

There was a revival in the 1890s, but from then onwards, croquet was always a minority sport, with national individual participation amounting to a few thousand players. The [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] still has a croquet lawn, but has not hosted any significant tournaments. The English headquarters for the game is now in [[Cheltenham]].

[[File:Eglington1.JPG|thumb|left|A game of Croquet being played at [[Eglinton Country Park|Eglinton Castle]], North Ayrshire, in the early 1860s]]
The earliest known reference to croquet in Scotland is the booklet ''The Game of Croquet, its Laws and Regulations'' which was published in the mid-1860s for the proprietor of Eglinton Castle, the [[Earl of Eglinton]]. On the page facing the title page is a picture of Eglinton Castle with a game of &quot;croquet&quot; in full swing.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Introduction |url=http://www.edinburghcroquetclub.com/intro.html |title=Edinburgh Croquet Club |accessdate=4 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710171159/http://www.edinburghcroquetclub.com/intro.html |archive-date=10 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between [[Eglinton Castle]] and the Lugton Water. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet, which had small bells on the eight hoops &quot;to ring the changes&quot;, two pegs, a double hoop with a bell and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. In 1865 the 'Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet' was published by [[Edmund Routledge]].  Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist, and one complete set is still used for demonstration games in the West of Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;/&gt;

==Competitive variations==
There are several variations of croquet currently played, differing in the scoring systems, order of shots, and layout (particularly in social games where play must be adapted to smaller-than-standard playing courts). Two forms of the game, association croquet and golf croquet, have rules that are agreed internationally and are played in many countries around the world. The United States has its own set of rules for domestic games. [[Gateball]], a sport originated in Japan under the influence of croquet, is played mainly in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Western Hemisphere|the Americas]], and can also be regarded as a croquet variant.

As well as club-level games, there are regular world championships and international matches between croquet-playing countries. The sport has particularly strong followings in the UK, US, New Zealand and Australia; every four years, these countries play the [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield|MacRobertson Shield]] tournament. Many other countries also play. The current world rankings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Rankings/teamranking.php |title=WCF World Team Rankings |date=8 April 2010 |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203043302/http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Rankings/teamranking.php |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; show England in top place for association croquet, followed by Australia and New Zealand sharing second place, with the United States in fourth position; the same four countries appear in the top six of the golf croquet league table, below Egypt in top position, and with South Africa at number five.

Croquet is popularly believed to be viciously competitive.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;So they left the subject and played croquet, which is a very good game for people who are annoyed at each other, giving many opportunities for venting rancour.&quot; —[[Rose Macaulay]], ''The Towers of Trebizond''&lt;/ref&gt; This may derive from the fact that (unlike in golf) players will often attempt to move their opponents' balls to unfavourable positions. However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy: successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents. At championship-standard association croquet, players can often make all 26 points (13 for each ball) in two turns.

Croquet [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|was an event]] at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]]. [[Roque]], an American variation on croquet, [[Roque at the 1904 Summer Olympics|was an event]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].

==Pronunciation==
As with similar words with a French derivation, the final 't' is silent. British pronunciation puts the accent on the first syllable, American on the second: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|k|eɪ}} versus {{IPAc-en|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|k|eɪ}}.

==Variations==

===Association===
[[File:Croquetplayers.jpg|thumb|Croquet being played at a club in the UK. (Four balls are visible on the lawn - Black, Green, Red, Brown - showing that two games are in progress (&quot;double-banking&quot;): red and black belong to one game, green and brown to the other)]]
[[File:2014 BL Wetherby Yorkshire Prof 15.jpg|thumb|right|Croquet being played recreationally in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]
Association croquet is the name of an advanced game of croquet, played at all levels up to international level. It involves four balls teamed in pairs, with both balls going through every hoop for one pair to win. The game's distinguishing feature is the &quot;croquet&quot; shot: when certain balls hit other balls, extra shots are allowed. The six hoops are arranged three at each end of the court, with a centre peg.

One side takes the black and blue balls, the other takes red and yellow. At each turn, players can choose to play with either of their balls for that turn. At the start of a turn, the player plays a stroke. If the player either hits the ball through the correct hoop (&quot;runs&quot; the hoop), or hits another ball (a &quot;roquet&quot;), the turn continues.

Following a roquet, the player picks up his or her own ball and puts it down next to the ball that it hit. The next shot is played with the two balls touching: this is the &quot;croquet stroke&quot; from which the game takes its name. By varying the speed and angle at which the mallet hits the striker's ball, a good player can control the final position of both balls: the horizontal angle determines how far the balls diverge in direction, while the vertical angle and the amount of follow-through determine the relative distance that the two balls travel.

After the croquet stroke, the player plays a &quot;continuation&quot; stroke, during which the player may again attempt to make a roquet or run a hoop. Each of the other three balls may be roqueted once in a turn before a hoop is run, after which they become available to be roqueted again.

The winner of the game is the team who completes the set circuit of six hoops (and then back again the other way), with both balls, and then strikes the centre peg (making a total of 13 points per ball = 26).

Good players may make &quot;{{cuegloss|break}}s&quot; or &quot;{{cuegloss|run}}s&quot; of several hoops in a single turn. The best players may take a ball round a full circuit in one turn. &quot;Advanced play&quot; (a variant of association play for expert players) gives penalties to a player who runs certain hoops in a turn, to allow the opponent a chance of getting back into the game; feats of skill such as triple peels or better, in which the partner ball (or occasionally an opponent ball) is caused to run a number of hoops in a turn by the striker's ball, help avoid these penalties.

A handicap system (&quot;bisques&quot;) provides less experienced players a chance of winning against more formidable opponents. Players of all ages and both sexes compete on level terms.

The World Championships are organised by the [[World Croquet Federation]] (WCF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |title=WFC News |date=9 September 2010 |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722003255/http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |archivedate=22 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually take place every two or three years. The 2018 championships took place in Wellington, New Zealand; the winner was Paddy Chapman of New Zealand. The current Women's Association Croquet World Champion (2015) is Miranda Chapman of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.croquetrecords.com/records/womensworlds/worlds2015.htm |title=Women's World Championship| date=1 August 2015 |publisher=Croquet Records Website|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy and Miranda are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Croquet Gazette|issue=373|date=April 2018|title=Paddy Chapman wins the AC World Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian team won the last [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield]] tournament, which is the major international test tour trophy in association croquet. It is contested every three to four years between Australia, Britain, the United States and New Zealand. Historically the British have been the dominant force, winning 14 out of the 22 times that the event has been held. In individual competition, the UK is often divided by subnational country (England, Scotland and [[Wales]]), while Northern Ireland joins with the republic in an All Ireland association (as it does in several other sports).

The world's top 10 association croquet players as of February 2018 were Robert Fletcher (Australia), [[Reg Bamford (croquet player)|Reg Bamford]] (South Africa), [[Robert Fulford (croquet player)|Robert Fulford]] (England), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), [[Ben Rothman]] (USA), Malcolm Fletcher (Australia), Jamie Burch (England), Jose Riva (Spain), [[Stephen Mulliner]] (England), Greg Bryant (New Zealand).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chris Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://butedock.demon.co.uk/cgs/rank.php |title= Croquet Grading System |first= Chris |last= Williams |accessdate= 11 February 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110903184322/http://butedock.demon.co.uk/cgs/rank.php |archive-date= 3 September 2011 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most sports, men and women compete and are ranked together. Three women have won the British Open Championship: [[Lily Gower]] in 1905, Dorothy Steel in 1925, 1933, 1935 and 1936, and Hope Rotherham in 1960. While male players are in the majority at club level in the UK, the opposite is the case in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chris Williams&quot;/&gt;

The governing body in England is The [[Croquet Association]], which has been the driving force of the development of the game. The rules and tournament regulations are now maintained by the International Laws Committee, established by the croquet associations of England and Wales (CA), Australia (ACA), New Zealand (CNZ) and the United States (USCA).

===Golf===
In golf croquet, a hoop is won by the first ball to go through each hoop. Unlike association croquet, there are no additional turns for hitting other balls.

Each player takes a stroke in turn, each trying to hit a ball through the same hoop. The sequence of play is blue, red, black, yellow. Blue and black balls play against red and yellow. When a hoop is won, the sequence of play continues as before. The winner of the game is the player/team who wins the most hoops.

Golf croquet is the fastest-growing version of the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/survey.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101121030026/http://croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/survey.htm | archivedate= 21 November 2010 | title=Older, Wealthier and with a bit to Think about |first= Kevin |last= Carter |year=2007 |publisher= The Croquet Association| accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; owing largely to its simplicity and competitiveness.  There is an especially large interest with competitive success by players in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Egypt v Rest of World GC Event |url=http://www.croquet.org.uk/news/newsdb.asp?NewsID=2766 |first= Elizabeth |last= Williams |location= Roehampton Club |date=21 July 2008 |publisher=The Croquet Association  |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golf croquet is easier to learn and play, but requires strategic skills and accurate play. In comparison with association croquet, play is faster and balls are more likely to be lifted off the ground.

In April 2013, [[Reg Bamford]] of [[South Africa]] beat Ahmed Nasr of Egypt in the final of the Golf Croquet World Championship in Cairo, becoming the first person to simultaneously hold the title in both association croquet and golf croquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Reg Bamford won the WCF GC Championship to become the first AC &amp; GC World Champion | first= Tim |last= King |location= Cairo | date= 28 April 2013 |url= https://www.croquet.org.uk/?p=/news/newsdb.asp&amp;NewsID=4457 |publisher=The Croquet Association | accessdate= 30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the Golf Croquet World Champion was [[Reginald Bamford|Reg Bamford]] (South Africa) and the Women's Golf Croquet World Champion was Judith Hanekom (South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.croquet.org.uk/?p=press/news&amp;NewsID=5128| date=21 November 2014 |title=WCF Women's GC Championship 2014 |first1= Tim |last1= King |location= Cairo |publisher= The Croquet Association |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, two international championships open to both sexes were won by women: in May, [[Rachel Gee]] of [[England]] beat [[Pierre Beaudry]] to win the European Golf Croquet championship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.croquet.org.uk/?p=press/news&amp;NewsID=6315|publisher= The Croquet Association |title=Rachel Gee won the European GC Championship|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October, [[Hanan Rashad]] of [[Egypt]] beat Yasser Fathy (also from Egypt) to win the World over-50s Golf Croquet championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://croquetscores.com/2018/gc/the-3th-over-50-golf-croquet-world-championship/championship|accessdate=14 Oct 2018|title=Croquet Scores: the 3rd Over 50 Golf Croquet World Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garden===
Garden croquet is widely played in the UK. The rules are easy to learn and the game can be played on lawns of almost any size but usually around {{convert|32|ft|m|disp=x| wide (|)}} by {{convert|40|ft|m|disp=x| long (|)|abbr=on}}. The rules are similar to those described above for Association Croquet with three major differences:

# The starting point for all balls is a spot {{Convert|3|ft|spell = in}} in from the boundary directly in front of hoop 1.
# If a striker's ball goes off, there is no penalty, it comes back on {{Convert|3|ft|spell = in}} and the turn continues.
# In a croquet stroke, the croqueted ball does not have to move when the striker's ball is struck.

This version of the game is easy for beginners to learn. The main Garden Croquet Club in the UK is the Bygrave Croquet Club which is a private club with five lawns. Other clubs also use garden croquet as an introduction to the game, notably the Hampstead Heath Croquet Club and the Watford Croquet Club.

===American six-wicket===
The American-rules version of croquet, another six-hoop game, is the dominant version of the game in the United States and is also widely played in [[Canada]]. It is [[Sports governing body|governed]] by the [[United States Croquet Association]]. Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American &quot;backyard&quot; croquet.

Two of the most notable differences are that the balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow) throughout the game, and that a ball's &quot;deadness&quot; on other balls is carried over from turn to turn until the ball has been &quot;cleared&quot; by scoring its next hoop. A Deadness Board is used to keep track of deadness on all four balls.  Tactics are simplified on the one hand by the strict sequence of play, and complicated on the other hand by the continuation of deadness. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ian Plummer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordcroquet.com/laws/usca/index.asp |title=Association vs US (6-wicket) Rules Croquet |first= Ian |last= Plummer |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Oxford Croquet  |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only {{convert|9|in|spell=in|cm}} from the boundary rather than {{Convert|1|yd|cm|spell = in}} as in association croquet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ian Plummer&quot;/&gt; &quot;Attacking&quot; balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.

===Nine-wicket===
Nine-wicket croquet, sometimes called &quot;backyard croquet&quot;, is played mainly in Canada and the United States, and is the game most recreational players in those countries call simply &quot;croquet&quot;.  In this version of croquet there are nine wickets, two stakes, and up to six balls.  The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake at each end of the course.  Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to end.  If playing individually (''Cutthroat''), the first player to stake out is the winner.  In partnership play, all members of a team must stake out, and a player might choose to avoid staking out (becoming a ''Rover'') in order to help a lagging teammate.

Each time a ball is roqueted, the striker gets two bonus shots.
For the first bonus shot, the player has four options:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/26/backyard-croquet-basic-rules|title=9-Wicket Croquet: Backyard Croquet: Basic Rules|author=|date=|website=www.9wicketcroquet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From a mallet-head distance or less away from the ball that was hit (&quot;taking a mallet-head&quot;)
* From a position in contact with the ball that was hit, with the striker ball held steady by the striker's foot or hand (a &quot;foot shot&quot; or &quot;hand shot&quot;)
* From a position in contact with the ball that was hit, with the striker ball not held by foot or hand (a &quot;croquet shot&quot;)
* From where the striker ball stopped after the roquet.
The second bonus shot (&quot;continuation shot&quot;) is an ordinary shot played from where the striker ball came to rest.

An alternate endgame is &quot;poison&quot;: in this variant, a player who has scored the last wicket but not hit the starting stake becomes a &quot;poison ball&quot;, which may eliminate other balls from the game by roqueting them.  A non-poison ball that roquets a poison ball has the normal options.  A poison ball that hits a stake or passes through any wicket (possibly by the action of a non-poison player) is eliminated.  The last person remaining is the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/28/backyard-croquet-challenging-options#option6|title=9-Wicket Croquet: Backyard Croquet: Challenging Options|author=|date=|website=www.9wicketcroquet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ricochet===
This version of the game was invented by John Riches of [[Adelaide, Australia]] with help from Tom Armstrong in the 1980s. The game can be played by up to six people and is very easy to learn. For this reason it is often used as a stepping stone to association croquet.

Ricochet has similar rules to association and garden croquet, except that when a ball is roqueted, the striker's ball remains live and two free shots are earned. This enables strikers to play their ball near to another opponent ball and ricochet that too thus earning two more free shots. Running a hoop earns one free shot.

===One-Ball===
One-ball croquet has become popular in recent years as a way of bringing AC (association) and GC (golf) players together. The rules are essentially
those of association croquet, except that each player/team has only one ball rather than two. This makes it very hard to create a break, which leads to more interactive play.

At the start of a turn, the striker is entitled to roquet all the other three balls once. Once the striker's ball goes through its target hoop, it is again entitled to roquet the other balls once.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Rover ball''': A ball that has run all 12 hoops and can be pegged out.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;

* '''Triple peel''' ('''TP'''): To send a ball other than the striker's ball through its last three hoops, and then peg it out. See also [[Triple Peel]], A variant is the '''Triple Peel on Opponent''' (TPO), where the peelee is the opponent's ball rather than the partner ball. The significance of this manoeuvre is that in advanced play, making a break that includes the tenth hoop (called 4-back) is penalized by granting the opponent a lift (entitling him to take the next shot from either baulk line). Therefore, many breaks stop voluntarily with three hoops and the peg still to run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Wired''': When a hoop or the peg impedes the path of a striker's ball, or the swing of the mallet. A player will often endeavour to finish a turn with the opponent's balls wired from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Yard line''': An imaginary line {{Convert|1|yd|spell = in}} from the boundary. Balls that go off the boundary are generally replaced on the yard line (but if this happens on a croquet stroke, the turn ends).&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot;/&gt;

The way croquet is depicted in paintings and books says much about popular perceptions of the game, though little about the reality of modern play.
* In 1868 a song titled ''Croquet'' (essentially anonymous: by M.B.C.S and W.O.F.) was included in a popular song book by W. O. Perkins, ''The Golden Robin'' (Pub. [[Oliver Ditson &amp; Company]], New York). (&quot;Upon the smoothly shaven lawn, Beneath the skies of May, Oh, boys and girls, this merry morn, Come out and play Croquet ...&quot;); there are four full verses.
* [[Winslow Homer]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Louise Abbéma]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] all have paintings titled ''The Croquet Game.''
* [[Norman Rockwell]] often depicted the game, including in his painting ''Croquet.''
* A favorite subject of [[Edward Gorey]], a croquet reference often appeared in the first illustration of his books. ''[[Edward Gorey#Books|The Epiplectic Bicycle]]'' opens with two illustrations of the main characters playing with croquet mallets.
* Croquet is popular pastime of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' characters.
* [[H. G. Wells]] wrote ''The Croquet Player,'' which uses croquet as a metaphor for the way in which people confront the very problem of their own existence.
* [[Lewis Carroll]] featured a [[Literary nonsense|nonsense]] version of the game in the popular children's novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'': a hedgehog was used as the ball, a flamingo as the mallet, and playing cards as the hoops.
* In the ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series of novels, notably ''[[Something Rotten]]'', [[Jasper Fforde]] depicts an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative world]] in which croquet is a brutal mass spectator sport.
* The cover of the 1971 [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] album ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' shows Cynthia, a character in the song &quot;Musical Box&quot; holding a croquet mallet with a few heads on the playing field including another character of the song Henry's head that she removed with said mallet.
* In the 1980s geography game ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', one of the characters, Fast Eddie B, is described as a &quot;world class croquet player&quot;, and two other gang members, Ihor Ihorovich and Scar Graynolt, also play the sport.
* In the 1988 film ''[[Heathers]]'', [[Winona Ryder]] and her friends, the Heathers, are depicted as playing croquet, though at the beginning, the Heathers are playing croquet to hit someone on the head. Croquet mallets also feature in the publicity posters for ''[[Heathers: The Musical]]''.

==In politics==
On 25 May 2006, the then [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Deputy Prime Minister]], [[John Prescott]], was photographed by ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' playing croquet at his official residence, [[Dorneywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14049-2206420,00.html|title=Prescott Quits Country House to Save Skin|last=Webster|first=Philip|date=1 June 2006|work=The Times|location=London|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following shortly after a sex scandal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4945170.stm|title=Prescott Admits Affair with Aide|date=28 April 2006|accessdate=4 May 2009 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had forced Prescott to resign his ministerial responsibilities while retaining his salary and privileges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2167472,00.html| title= Prescott loses his dream home: the mega-department| last= Knight| first= Sam| date= 5 May 2006|work=The Times|accessdate=4 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident was portrayed as evidence that Prescott had little real responsibility for running the country during the absence of the Prime Minister. Shortly afterwards, Prescott announced that he would no longer make use of the Dorneywood residence.

It was also reported that the incident led to a 300% increase in sales of croquet equipment at [[Asda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-388666/Prescott-helps-croquet-sets-sales-soar.html|title=Prescott helps croquet sets sales soar|date=1 June 2006| work= Daily Mail|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the TV channel [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] announced that they would be running a series featuring croquet matches played at country houses pitting &quot;rich&quot; against &quot;poor&quot; players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://politics.guardian.co.uk/media/story/0,,1789053,00.html |title= Five pitches rich v poor in pro-celebrity croquet|last=Busfield|first=Steve|date=2 June 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubs==
About 200 croquet clubs across the United States are members of the United States Croquet Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croquetamerica.com/usca/directory/clubs/ |title=Clubs Directory |publisher=United Statese Croquet Association |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colleges have croquet clubs as well, such as [[The University of Virginia]], [[The University of Chicago]], [[Pennsylvania State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.athletics.psu.edu/recreation/clubs.asp?Club_ID=97 |title= Penn State Club Sports |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111030092355/http://www.athletics.psu.edu/recreation/clubs.asp?Club_ID=97 |archivedate= 30 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bates College]], [[State University of New York at New Paltz|SUNY New Paltz]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Dartmouth College]]. Notably, [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] and the [[US Naval Academy]] engage in a yearly match in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. Both schools also compete at the collegiate level and the rivalry continues to be an Annapolis tradition, attracting thousands of spectators each April.

In England and Wales, there are around 170 clubs affiliated with the Croquet Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.croquet.org.uk/clubs/index.html |title=Clubs and Federations |publisher=The Croquet Association |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] at Wimbledon is famous for its [[lawn tennis]] tournament, but retains an active croquet section. There are also clubs in many universities and colleges, with an annual Varsity match being played between Oxford and Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~croquet/varsity/archive.shtml |title=Varsity Archive |publisher=Oxford University Croquet Club |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 1800 participants, the 2011 Oxford University &quot;Cuppers&quot; (inter-college) tournament claimed to be not only the largest croquet tournament ever, but the largest sporting event in the university's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Oxford University Croquet Club - Welcome! | url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~croquet/college/cuppersintro.shtml |publisher= Users.ox.ac.uk | accessdate= 3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
