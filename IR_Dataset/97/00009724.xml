'''Eden Phillpotts''' (4 November 1862 – 29 December 1960) was an English author, poet and dramatist. He was born in Mount Abu, India, was educated in Plymouth, Devon, and worked as an insurance officer for 10 years before studying for the stage and eventually becoming a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=PHILLPOTTS, Eden|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1396|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Eden Phillpotts was a great-nephew of [[Henry Phillpotts]], Bishop of Exeter. His father Henry Phillpotts was a son of the bishop’s younger brother Thomas Phillpotts. [[James Surtees Phillpotts]] the reforming headmaster of [[Bedford School]] was his second cousin.&lt;ref&gt;''Phillpotts Genealogy'', Percy Phillpotts, 1910 (manuscript in family possession)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eden Phillpotts was born on 4 November 1862 at [[Mount Abu]] in [[Rajasthan]]. His father Henry was an officer in the [[Indian Army]], while his mother Adelaide was the daughter of an [[Indian Civil Service]] officer posted in Madras, George Jenkins Waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography'', article by Thomas Moult&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Phillpotts died in 1865, leaving Adelaide a widow at the age of 21. With her three small sons, of whom Eden was the eldest, she returned to England and settled in [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Angle88&quot;&gt;Eden Phillpotts, ''From the Angle of 88'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillpotts was educated at Mannamead School in Plymouth. At school he showed no signs of a literary bent. In 1879, aged 17, he left home and went to London to earn his living. He found a job as a clerk with the [[RSA Insurance Group|Sun Fire Office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Angle88&quot;/&gt;

Phillpotts’ ambition was to be an actor and he attended evening classes at a drama school for two years. He came to the conclusion that he would never make a name as an actor but might have success as a writer. In his spare time out of office hours he proceeded to create a stream of small works which he was able to sell. In due course he left the insurance company to concentrate on his writing, while also working part-time as assistant editor for the weekly [[Black and White (magazine)|Black and White Magazine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Angle88&quot;/&gt;

Eden Phillpotts maintained a steady output of three or four books a year for the next half century. He produced poetry, short stories, novels, plays and mystery tales. Many of his novels were about rural [[Devon]] life and some of his plays were distinguished by their effective use of regional dialect.

Eden Phillpotts died at his home in [[Broadclyst]] near [[Exeter]], Devon, on 29 December 1960.

==Personal life==
Phillpotts was for many years the President of the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]] and cared passionately about the conservation of Dartmoor.  He was an agnostic and a supporter of the [[Rationalist Press Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;...among the honorary associates of the [Rationalist Press] Association, past and present, are distinguished names such as...Eden Phillpotts.&quot;'' Quoted in [[Harry Snell, 1st Baron Snell|Lord Snell]], ''Men, Movements And Myself'' (p. 156), J.M. Dent and Sons, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillpotts was a friend of [[Agatha Christie]], who was an admirer of his work and a regular visitor to his home. In her autobiography she expressed gratitude for his early advice on fiction writing and quoted some of it. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was another Phillpotts admirer.&lt;ref&gt;''Jorge Luis Borges: Conversations''. University Press of Mississippi, 1998. Page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Borges mentioned him numerous times, wrote at least two reviews of his novels, and included him in his &quot;Personal Library&quot;, a collection of works selected to reflect his personal literary preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jorge Luis Borges Personal Library Collection|url=http://www.personallibrarieslibrary.com/2010/05/jorge-luis-borges-personal-library.html|website=personallibrarieslibrary.com|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philpotts allegedly sexually abused his daughter Adelaide. In a 1976 interview for a book about her father, Adelaide described an incestuous &quot;relationship&quot; with him that she says lasted from the age of five or six until her early thirties, when he remarried. When she herself finally married at the age of 55 her father never forgave her, and never communicated with her again.&lt;ref name=ade&gt;James Y. Dayananda, ‘Phillpotts , (Mary) Adelaide Eden (1896–1993)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2012 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49176, accessed 9 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Phillpotts wrote a great many books with a Dartmoor setting. One of his novels, ''[[Widecombe Fair (novel)|Widecombe Fair]]'', inspired by an annual [[Widecombe Fair|fair]] at the village of [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]], provided the scenario for his comic play ''[[The Farmer's Wife (play)|The Farmer's Wife]]'' (1916). It went on to become a 1928 silent [[The Farmer's Wife|film of the same name]], directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. It was followed by a [[The Farmer's Wife (1941 film)|1941 remake]], directed by [[Norman Lee]] and [[Leslie Arliss]]. It became a BBC TV drama in 1955, directed by 
Owen Reed. [[Jan Stewer]] played Churdles Ash. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4417928/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ql_1&lt;/ref&gt;. The BBC had broadcast the play in 1934.

He co-wrote several plays with his daughter [[Adelaide Phillpotts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Head2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Head|first=Dominic (ed.)|title=The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQINrHtwNU0C&amp;pg=PA868|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83179-6|page=868}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Farmer's Wife'' and ''[[Yellow Sands (play)|Yellow Sands]]'' (1926);&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 735&lt;/ref&gt; she later claimed their relationship was incestuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=George M.|title=Late-Victorian and Edwardian British Novelists: First series|date=1995|publisher=Gale Research Incorporated|isbn=9780810357143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IO9DHjMx2y4C|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ade/&gt; Eden is best known as the author of many novels, plays and poems about [[Dartmoor]]. His Dartmoor cycle of 18 novels and two volumes of short stories still has many avid readers despite the fact that many titles are out of print.

Philpotts also wrote a series of novels, each set against the background of a different trade or industry. Titles include: ''Brunel's Tower'' (a pottery) and ''Storm in a Teacup'' (hand-papermaking). Among his other works is ''The Grey Room'', the plot of which is centered on a haunted room in an English manor house. He also wrote a number of other mystery novels, both under his own name and the pseudonym '''Harrington Hext'''. These include: ''The Thing at Their Heels'', ''[[The Red Redmaynes]]'', ''The Monster'', ''The Clue from the Stars'', and ''The Captain's Curio''. ''The Human Boy''&lt;ref&gt;Philpotts, Eden; The Human Boy; Pub: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; was a collection of schoolboy stories in the same genre as [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Stalky &amp; Co.]], though different in mood and style. Late in his long writing career he wrote a few books of interest to science fiction and [[fantasy]] readers, the most noteworthy being ''Saurus'', which involves an alien reptilian observing human life.

[[Eric Partridge]] praised the immediacy and impact of his dialect writing.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, ''Usage and Abusage'' (1964) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;
