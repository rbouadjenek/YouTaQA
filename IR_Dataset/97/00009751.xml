'''Elwyn Brooks White''' (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985)&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times Obituary&quot;/&gt; was an American writer. For more than fifty years, he was a contributor to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. He was also a co-author of the English language [[style guide]] ''[[The Elements of Style]].'' In addition, he wrote books for children, including ''[[Stuart Little]]'' (1945), ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan]]'' (1970). In a 2012 survey of ''School Library Journal'' readers, ''Charlotte's Web'' came in first in their poll of the top one hundred children's novels.&lt;ref name=SLJ/&gt;

==Life==

White was born in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], the youngest child of Samuel Tilly White, the president of a piano firm, and Jessie Hart White, the daughter of Scottish-American painter [[William Hart (painter)|William Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Root|first=Robert L.|title=E. B. White: The Emergence of an Essayist|year=1999|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=978-0-87745-667-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elwyn's older brother [[Stanley Hart White]], known as Stan, a professor of landscape architecture and the inventor of the Vertical Garden, taught E. B. White to read and to explore the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/14601176.2013.807653|title = Stanley Hart White and the question of 'What is Modern?'| journal=Studies in the History of Gardens &amp; Designed Landscapes| volume=33| issue=3| pages=170–177|year = 2013|last1 = Hindle|first1 = Richard L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; White graduated from [[Cornell University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in 1921. He got  the nickname &quot;Andy&quot; at Cornell, where tradition confers that moniker on any male student whose surname is White, after Cornell co-founder [[Andrew Dickson White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/footsteps/exhibition/buildingcollections/buildingcollections_8.html |title=Building Cornell University Library’s Collections: E.

According to Cornell tradition, all male students named White were nicknamed after Cornell’s first president, Andrew Dickson White.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Cornell, he worked as editor of ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'' with classmate [[Allison Danzig]], who later became a sportswriter for ''[[The New York Times]]''. White was also a member of the [[Aleph Samach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Elwyn Brooks|title=Letters of E. B.

After graduation, White worked for the United Press (now [[United Press International]]) and the [[American Legion]] News Service in 1921 and 1922. From September 1922 to June 1923, he was a cub reporter for ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. On one occasion, when White was stuck writing a story, a Times editor said, &quot;Just say the words.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joesutt.com/writing-process/week-20-writing-quotations |website=www.joesutt.com| title=Week 20 – Writing Quotations|access-date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fired from the ''Times'' and later wrote for the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' before a stint in Alaska on a fireboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Long |first=Priscilla |date=July 26, 2001 |title=The Seattle Times fires E. B. White on June 19, 1923. |url=https://www.historylink.org/File/3467 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked for almost two years with the Frank Seaman advertising agency as a production assistant and copywriter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E. B. White Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/We-Z/White-E-B.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to New York City in 1924. When ''The New Yorker'' was founded in 1925, White submitted manuscripts to it. [[Katharine Sergeant Angell White|Katharine Angell]], the literary editor, recommended to editor-in-chief and founder [[Harold Ross]] that White be hired as a staff writer. However, it took months to convince him to come to a meeting at the office and additional weeks to convince him to work on the premises. Eventually, he agreed to work in the office on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurber|first=James|authorlink=James Thurber|title=Credos and Curios|chapter=E. B. W.|page=124|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=1969|isbn=978-0-14-003044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White was shy around women, claiming he had “too small a heart, too large a pen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Sex Necessary?|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/9/7/is-sex-necessary |website=The Attic|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1929, culminating an affair which led to her divorce, White and Katherine Angell were married. They had a son, [[Joel White]], a naval architect and boat builder, who later owned Brooklin Boat Yard in [[Brooklin, Maine]]. Katharine's son from her first marriage, [[Roger Angell]], has spent decades as a fiction editor for ''The New Yorker'' and is well known as the magazine's baseball writer.

In her foreword to ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', [[Kate DiCamillo]] quotes White as saying, &quot;All that I hope to say in books, all that I ever hope to say, is that I love the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=E. B.|title=Charlotte's Web|year=1952|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0-06-440055-8|page=ii|url=https://archive.org/details/charlottessweb00whit}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also loved animals, farms and farming implements, seasons, and weather formats.

[[James Thurber]] described White as a quiet man who disliked publicity and who, during his time at ''The New Yorker'', would slip out of his office via the fire escape to a nearby branch of [[Schrafft's (restaurant chain)|Schrafft's]] to avoid visitors whom he didn't know. {{Quotation|Most of us, out of a politeness made up of faint curiosity and profound resignation, go out to meet the smiling stranger with a gesture of surrender and a fixed grin, but White has always taken to the fire escape. He has avoided the Man in the Reception Room as he has avoided the interviewer, the photographer, the microphone, the rostrum, the literary tea, and the [[Stork Club]]. His life is his own. He is the only writer of prominence I know of who could walk through [[Algonquin Hotel|the Algonquin]] lobby or between the tables at Jack and Charlie's and be recognized only by his friends.|James Thurber|E. B. W.|&quot;Credos and Curios&quot;}}

White had [[Alzheimer's disease]] and died on October 1, 1985, at his [[E. B. White House|farm home]] in North Brooklin, Maine.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitgang|first=Herbert|title=E. B.

==Career==
[[File:E B White.jpg|thumb|175px|White in his twenties]]
E. B.   White published his first article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1925, then joined the staff in 1927 and continued to contribute for almost six decades. Best recognized for his essays and unsigned &quot;Notes and Comment&quot; pieces, he gradually became the magazine's most important contributor. From the beginning to the end of his career at ''The New Yorker,'' he frequently provided what the magazine calls &quot;Newsbreaks&quot; (short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources) under various categories such as &quot;Block That Metaphor.&quot; He also was a columnist for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' from 1938 to 1943.

In 1949, White published ''Here Is New York'', a short book based on an article he had been commissioned to write for ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]''. Editor [[Ted Patrick (editor)|Ted Patrick]] approached White about writing the essay telling him it would be fun. &quot;Writing is never 'fun,'&amp;#8201;&quot; replied White.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/05/holiday-magazine-history|title=The Visual and Writerly Genius of Holiday Magazine|last=Callahan|first=Michael|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; That article reflects the writer's appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both &quot;the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy.&quot; It concludes with a dark note touching on the forces that could destroy the city that he loved. This prescient &quot;love letter&quot; to the city was re-published in 1999 on his centennial with an introduction by his stepson, [[Roger Angell]].

In 1959, White edited and updated ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of [[American English]] was first written and published in 1918 by [[William Strunk Jr.]], one of White's professors at Cornell. White's reworking of the book was extremely well received, and later editions followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. [[Maira Kalman]] illustrated an edition in 2005. That same year, a New York composer named [[Nico Muhly]] premiered a short opera based on the book. The volume is a standard tool for students and writers and remains required reading in many composition classes. The complete history of ''[[The Elements of Style]] ''is detailed in Mark Garvey's ''Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style''.

In 1978, White won a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special Pulitzer Prize]] citing &quot;his letters, essays and the full body of his work&quot;.&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Special-Awards-and-Citations &quot;Special Awards and Citations&quot;]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved December 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963 and honorary memberships in a variety of literary societies throughout the United States. The 1973 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Oscar-nominated]] Canadian animated [[short film|short]] ''[[The Family That Dwelt Apart]]'' is narrated by White and is based on his short story of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=11708|title=The Family That Dwelt Apart|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=November 25, 2012|date=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's books==
In the late 1930s, White turned his hand to [[Children's literature|children's fiction]] on behalf of a niece, Janice Hart White. His first children's book, ''[[Stuart Little]]'', was published in 1945, and ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' followed in 1952. ''[[Stuart Little]]'' initially received a lukewarm welcome from the literary community. However, both books went on to receive high acclaim, and ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' won the [[Newbery Medal]] from the [[American Library Association]].

White received the [[Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal]] from the U.S. professional children's librarians in 1970. It recognized his &quot;substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature.&quot; &lt;ref name=wilder/&gt; That year, he was also the U.S. nominee and eventual runner-up for the biennial [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], as he was again in 1976.&lt;ref name=weales/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-nominee/&gt; Also, in 1970, White's third children's novel was published, ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan]]''. In 1973 it won the Sequoyah Award from Oklahoma and the [[William Allen White Award]] from Kansas, both selected by students voting for their favorite book of the year. In 2012, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' sponsored a survey of readers, which identified ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' as the best children's novel (&quot;fictional title for readers 9–12&quot; years old). The librarian who conducted it said, &quot;It is impossible to conduct a poll of this sort and expect [White's novel] to be anywhere but #1.&quot;&lt;ref name=SLJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;
