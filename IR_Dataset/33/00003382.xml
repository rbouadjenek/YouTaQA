'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]&quot;, Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&amp;nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.

Spears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard_472190&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot;, &quot;[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]&quot;, &quot;[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]&quot;, &quot;[[Hold It Against Me]]&quot;, and &quot;[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]&quot;. Other singles, &quot;[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]&quot; and &quot;[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]&quot;, topped the charts in most countries. With &quot;3&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot; in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Britney Spears|numerous awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]]; seven [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Records]]; six [[MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]]; seven [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], including the Millennium Award;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7350405/britney-spears-billboard-millenium-award-honoree|title=Britney Spears to Perform Hits Medley at Billboard Music Awards|website=Billboard|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/18/content_282531.htm Britney Spears gets star on Walk of Fame] (November 18, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing &quot;[[What Child Is This?]]&quot; at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rs1&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Daly |first=Steven |date=April 15, 1999 |title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-254871/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |issn=0035-791X |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010|last=Reporter|first=Staff |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131124739/https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html| archive-date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said about her ambition as a child, &quot;I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age&quot;.&lt;ref name=rs1 /&gt;

At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]], Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.

Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]]. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's [[Parklane Academy]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to &quot;the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to [[homecoming]] and [[Winter Formal|Christmas formal]]. But I wanted more.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It|date=May 25, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and &quot;there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hughes145&quot; /&gt;

Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref name=&quot;hughes145&quot; /&gt; Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that &quot;it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt; Spears sang Houston's &quot;[[I Have Nothing]]&quot; (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Taylor, Chuck | url = https://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage | journal=Billboard | title = Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' | volume = 110 | issue = 43 | date = October 24, 1998 | accessdate = March 11, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from &quot;lower and less poppy&quot; delivery to &quot;distinctively, unmistakably Britney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned &quot;[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger; more adult contemporary.&quot; She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since &quot;It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt; She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt;

=== 1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' ===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [[NSYNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 12, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-20110329|title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story|work=Rolling Stone|year=2011|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.&lt;ref name=foxnews /&gt;

The [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot; /&gt; The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], topping the chart for two consecutive weeks.

In 2011, Adam Markovitz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on Spears's voice and music: &quot;We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer [...] we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. [...] She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. [...] Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as [[Michael Jackson]]'s yips or [[Eminem]]'s snarls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2011/03/31/femme-fatale-6/|title=Music Review: Femme Fatale|last=Markovitz|first=Adam|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, ''Rolling Stone'' included Spears on its Millennial 100 list and said that, following the release of her music career in the late 1990s, she &quot;quickly became the princess of pop, helping to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed [[New Kids on the Block]]. [...] Spears would lead an army of pop stars... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time — and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/the-millennial-100-737215/britney-spears-hits-and-misses-737216/ |date=October 17, 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |author=Spanos, Brittany |access-date=October 8, 2019| title=The Millennial 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
