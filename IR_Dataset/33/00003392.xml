'''British Columbia''' ('''BC'''; {{lang-fr|Colombie-Britannique}}) is the westernmost [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province in Canada]], located between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. With an estimated population of 5.1&amp;nbsp;million {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, it is Canada's [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by population|third-most populous province]].

The first [[British people|British]] settlement in the area was [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]], established in 1843, which gave rise to the [[Victoria, British Columbia|City of Victoria]], at first the capital of the separate [[Colony of Vancouver Island]]. Subsequently, on the mainland, the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866)]] was founded by [[Richard Clement Moody]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Clement Moody Obituary, ICE&quot;&gt;Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 90, Issue 1887, 1887, pp. 453–455, Obituary. Major-General Richard Clement Moody, R.E., 1813–1887.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment]], in response to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]. Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]]: he was hand-picked by the [[Colonial Office]] in [[London]] to transform British Columbia into the [[British Empire]]'s &quot;bulwark in the farthest west&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald J.

In 1866, Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia, and Victoria became the united colony's capital. In 1871, British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada. Its [[Latin]] motto is ''Splendor sine occasu'' (&quot;Splendour without Diminishment&quot;).

The capital of British Columbia is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|fifteenth-largest metropolitan region]] in Canada, named for [[Queen Victoria]], who ruled during the creation of the original colonies. The largest city is [[Vancouver]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Canada, the largest in [[Western Canada]], and the second-largest in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. In October 2013, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 (about 2.5&amp;nbsp;million of whom were in [[Greater Vancouver]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Demography/PopulationEstimates.aspx |title=Population Estimates, British Columbia and Sub-Provincial |publisher=BC Stats |date=December 2012 |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province is currently governed by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]], led by [[John Horgan]], in a minority government with the [[confidence and supply]] of the [[Green Party of British Columbia]]. Horgan became [[Premier (Canada)|premier]] as a result of a no-confidence motion on June 29, 2017.

British Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871. [[First Nations]], the original inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area. Today there are few treaties, and the question of Aboriginal Title, long ignored, has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions. Notably, the [[Tsilhqot'in]] Nation has established Aboriginal title to a portion of their territory, as a result of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision in ''[[Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia]]''.

==Etymology==
The province's name was chosen by [[Queen Victoria]], when the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866)]], i.e., &quot;the Mainland&quot;, became a British colony in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ged |last=Martin |title=The Naming of British Columbia |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=1978 |pages=257–263 |jstor=4048132|doi=10.2307/4048132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[Columbia District]], the British name for the territory drained by the [[Columbia River]], in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-[[Oregon Treaty]] [[Columbia Department]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Queen Victoria chose ''British'' Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from the United States (&quot;American Columbia&quot; or &quot;Southern Columbia&quot;), which became the [[Oregon Territory]] on August 8, 1848, as a result of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWRSgAACAAJ |title=British Columbia Chronicle, 1847–1871: Gold &amp; Colonists |last1=Akrigg |first1=Helen B. |author2=G.P.V. |publisher=Discovery Press |year=1977 |edition=illustrated|isbn=9780919624030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the ''Columbia'' in the name ''British Columbia'' is derived from the name of the ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'', an American ship which lent its name to the [[Columbia River]] and later the wider region;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/british-columbia-508559 |title=Why is the Western Region of Canada Called British Columbia? |accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Columbia'' in the name ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'' came from [[Columbia (name)|the name ''Columbia'' for the New World or parts thereof]], a reference to [[Christopher Columbus]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of British Columbia}}
[[File:BC-relief.png|thumb|British Columbia's [[geography]] is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief, which has defined patterns of [[Human settlement|settlement]] and industry since colonization.]]

British Columbia is bordered to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the American state of [[Alaska]], to the north by [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], to the east by the province of [[Alberta]], and to the south by the American states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. The [[Definitions of Canadian borders#British Columbia|southern border of British Columbia]] was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as [[California]]. British Columbia's land area is {{convert|944735|km2|-2}}. [[British Columbia Coast|British Columbia's rugged coastline]] stretches for more than {{convert|27000|km}}, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. It is the only province in [[Canada]] that borders the [[Pacific Ocean]].

British Columbia's capital is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], located at the southeastern tip of [[Vancouver Island]]. Only a narrow strip of Vancouver Island, from [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] to Victoria, is significantly populated. Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by [[temperate rainforest]].
The province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is at the confluence of the [[Fraser River]] and [[Georgia Strait]], in the mainland's southwest corner (an area often called the [[Lower Mainland]]). By land area, [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] is the largest city. [[Vanderhoof, British Columbia|Vanderhoof]] is near the geographic centre of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vanderhoof |publisher=Tourism BC |url=http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm |accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110709215521/http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm |archive-date = July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bcmap.png|alt=Outline map of British Columbia with significant cities and towns.|left|thumb|Outline map of British Columbia with significant cities and towns]]
The [[Coast Mountains]] and the [[Inside Passage]]'s many [[fjord|inlets]] provide some of British Columbia's renowned and spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and [[ecotourism]] industry. 75% of the province is mountainous (more than {{convert|1000|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]); 60% is forested; and only about 5% is arable.

The province's mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the Pacific Ocean. Terrain ranges from dry inland forests and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] valleys, to the range and canyon districts of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior]], to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the [[British Columbia Interior|Northern Interior]]. High mountain regions both north and south have [[Montane ecosystems#Subalpine zone|subalpine flora]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Subalpine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ecology of the Engelmann Spruce – Subalpine Fir Zone |url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/Bro/bro55.pdf |publisher=B.C. Ministry of Forests |accessdate=2019-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[subalpine climate]].

The [[Okanagan area (wine)|Okanagan area]], extending from [[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]] to [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] at the United States border, is one of several wine and [[cider]]-producing regions in Canada. Other wine regions in British Columbia include the [[Cowichan Valley]] on Vancouver Island and the [[Fraser Valley]].

The Southern Interior cities of [[Kamloops]] and [[Penticton]] have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada (while higher elevations are cold and snowy), although their temperatures are often exceeded north of the [[Fraser Canyon]], close to the confluence of the Fraser and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers, where the terrain is rugged and covered with desert-type flora. Semi-desert grassland is found in large areas of the [[Interior Plateau]], with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones.

The northern, mostly mountainous, two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, except for the area east of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockies]], where the [[Peace River Country]] contains BC's portion of the [[Canadian Prairies]], centred at the city of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]].

British Columbia is considered part of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadia bioregion]], along with the [[U.S. state|American states]] of [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] (western portion), [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |title=Pacific Northwest Washington Oregon British Columbia |publisher=Celebratebig.com |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222031254/http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |archivedate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooltrails.com/ |title=Northwest Hiking Trails: Washington, Oregon, Idaho |publisher=Cooltrails.com |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119222550/http://www.cooltrails.com/ |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:British Columbia Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in British Columbia]]
[[File:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|The [[Strait of Georgia]], near [[Vancouver]]]]
Coastal southern British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate, some far southern parts of which are warm-summer Mediterranean, influenced by the [[North Pacific Current]], which has its origins in the [[Kuroshio Current]]. Due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the climate of some of the interior valleys of the province is semi-arid with certain locations receiving less than {{convert|250|mm}} in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to {{convert|12|C|0}}, the mildest anywhere in Canada.

The valleys of the Southern Interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow, while those in the [[Cariboo]], in the [[British Columbia Interior#Central Interior|Central Interior]], are colder because of increased altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada. For example, the average daily low in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (roughly in the middle of the province) in January is {{convert|-12|C|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=631&amp;lang=e&amp;StationName=Prince+George&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&amp;dCode=1 |title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981–2010 Station Data |work=weather.gc.ca|date=October 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small towns in the southern interior with high elevation such as [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]] are typically colder and snowier than cities in the valleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Princeton&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&amp;txtStationName=princeton&amp;searchMethod=contains&amp;txtCentralLatMin=0&amp;txtCentralLatSec=0&amp;txtCentralLongMin=0&amp;txtCentralLongSec=0&amp;stnID=1056&amp;dispBack=1 |title=Princeton A |work=Canadian Climate Normals 1981–2010 |accessdate=2018-01-15|date = September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central British Columbia. Annual snowfall on highway mountain passes in the southern interior rival some of the snowiest cities in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GLACIER NP ROGERS PASS |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&amp;txtStationName=pass&amp;searchMethod=contains&amp;txtCentralLatMin=0&amp;txtCentralLatSec=0&amp;txtCentralLongMin=0&amp;txtCentralLongSec=0&amp;stnID=1363&amp;dispBack=1 |website=Canadian Climate Normals 1981–2010 Station Data |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=2019-01-16|date = September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and freezing rain and fog are sometimes present on such roads as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McElroy |first1=Justin |title=Weather closes every highway linking Lower Mainland to rest of B.C. |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/weather-closes-every-highway-linking-lower-mainland-to-rest-of-b-c-1.3975497 |accessdate=2019-01-16 |agency=CBC |date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in hazardous driving conditions as people are usually travelling between warmer areas such as Vancouver or [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]], and may be unaware that the conditions may be slippery and cold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What You Need to Know About Winter Weather on the &quot;Coq&quot; |url=https://www.tranbc.ca/2016/12/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-winter-weather-on-the-coq/ |publisher=TranBC |accessdate=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shuswap Lake from Sorrento, B.C..jpg|alt=|thumb|Shuswap Lake as seen from Sorrento]]
Winters are generally severe in the Northern Interior, but even there milder air can penetrate far inland. The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in [[Smith River, British Columbia|Smith River]], where it dropped to {{convert|-58.9|C|0}} on January 31, 1947,&lt;ref name=&quot;KCH-WD2-2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Heidorn |first=Keith C. |title=North America's Record Cold |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2002/alm02feb.htm |publisher=The Weather Doctor Almanac |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North America. [[Atlin, British Columbia|Atlin]] in the province's far northwest, along with the adjoining Southern Lakes region of [[Yukon]], get midwinter thaws caused by the [[Chinook (wind)|Chinook]] effect, which is also common (and much warmer) in more southerly parts of the Interior.

During winter on the coast, rainfall, sometimes relentless heavy rain, dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic low-pressure systems from the North Pacific. Average snowfall on the coast during a normal winter is between {{convert|25|and|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}, but on occasion (and not every winter) heavy snowfalls with more than {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas, typically for short periods, and can take temperatures below {{convert|-10|C}}, even at sea level. Arctic outflow winds can occasionally result in wind chill temperatures at or even below {{convert|-17.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}. While winters are very wet, coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anti-cyclonic high pressure.

Southern Interior valleys are hot in summer; for example, in [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] the July maximum temperature averages {{convert|31.7|C|0}}, making it the hottest month of any location in Canada; this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province. Temperatures often exceed {{convert|40|C|0}} in the lower elevations of valleys in the Interior during mid-summer, with the record high of {{convert|44.4|C}} being held in [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]] on July 16, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=CA&amp;StationID=966&amp;Year=1941&amp;Month=7&amp;Day=26 |title=Daily Data Report for July 1941 |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=September 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028193950/http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=CA&amp;StationID=966&amp;Year=1941&amp;Month=7&amp;Day=26 |archivedate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vineyards Lake Okanagan.jpg|thumb|The [[Okanagan]] region has a climate suitable to vineyards.]]
The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires, from dry-lightning or man-made causes. Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months, in contrast to abundant summer sunshine. Annual sunshine hours vary from 2200 near Cranbrook and Victoria to less than 1300 in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], on the [[British Columbia Coast#North Coast|North Coast]] just south of [[Southeast Alaska]].

The exception to British Columbia's wet and cloudy winters is during the [[El Niño]] phase. During El Niño events, the jet stream is much farther south across North America, making the province's winters milder and drier than normal. Winters are much wetter and cooler during the opposite phase, [[La Niña]].

There are 14 designations of parks and protected areas in the province that reflect the different administration and creation of these areas in a modern context. There are 141 ecological reserves, 35 provincial marine parks, 7 provincial heritage sites, 6 [[National Historic Sites of Canada]], 4 [[national park]]s and 3 national park reserves. 12.5% of the province's area ({{convert|114000|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is considered protected under one of the 14 different designations that includes over 800 distinct areas.

British Columbia contains seven of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's national parks]] and National Park Reserves:
* [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]]
* [[Gulf Islands National Park Reserve]]
* [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site]]
* [[Kootenay National Park]]
* [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]]
* [[Pacific Rim National Park Reserve]]
* [[Yoho National Park]]

British Columbia contains a large number of [[provincial park]]s, run by BC Parks under the aegis of the Ministry of Environment. British Columbia's provincial parks system is the second largest parks system in Canada, the largest being Canada's National Parks system).

Another tier of parks in British Columbia are [[regional park]]s, which are maintained and run by [[List of regional districts of British Columbia|the province's regional districts]]. The Ministry of Forests operates forest recreation sites.

In addition to these areas, over {{convert|47000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[arable land]] are protected by the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]].

Much of the province is undeveloped, so populations of many mammalian species that have become rare in much of the United States still flourish in British Columbia. Watching animals of various sorts, including a very wide range of birds, has long been popular. Bears ([[Grizzly bear|grizzly]], [[American black bear|black]]—including the [[Kermode bear]] or spirit bear) live here, as do [[deer]], [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Caribou (North America)|caribou]], [[Bighorn sheep|big-horn sheep]], [[mountain goat]]s, [[marmot]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[mustelidae|mustelids]] (such as [[wolverine]]s, [[badger]]s and [[fisher (animal)|fishers]]), [[cougar]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s, [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], [[swan]]s, [[loon]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[raven]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, and many other sorts of ducks. Smaller birds ([[American robin|robins]], [[jay]]s, [[grosbeak]]s, [[Tit (bird)|chickadees]], and so on) also abound. Murrelets are known from Frederick Island, a small islands off the coast of [[Haida Gwaii]].&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, D.1998. ''The Life of Birds''. BBC publication. {{ISBN|0563-38792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many healthy populations of fish are present, including [[salmonidae|salmonids]] such as several species of [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[Salvelinus|char]]. Besides salmon and trout, sport-fishers in BC also catch [[halibut]], [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[sturgeon]]. On the coast, [[harbour seal]]s and [[North American river otter|river otters]] are common. [[Cetacea]]n species native to the coast include the [[Killer whale|orca]], [[humpback whale]], [[grey whale]], [[harbour porpoise]], [[Dall's porpoise]], [[Pacific white-sided dolphin]] and [[minke whale]].

===Traditional plant foods===
{{Main|Wild and medicinal plants of British Columbia}}

Plant foods traditionally contributed only a part of the total food intake of coastal [[First Nations]] peoples of British Columbia, though they contributed to most of the material good produced. Among the plant foods used, berries, some roots (for example the Camas Lily – part of the [[Camassia]] family), cambium noodles (inner bark of [[Tsuga|hemlock]]), and seaweeds were (and to an extent still are) important. Animal products were traditionally far more important than plant foods in terms of quantity consumed, but the huge nutritional diversity provided by native plants largely contributes to the health of First Nations peoples of British Columbia. (Before [[colonization]], British Columbia had the densest aboriginal population of any region in what is now called Canada.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversitybc.org/assets/Default/BBC%20Importance%20of%20Biodiversity%20to%20First%20Peoples.pdf |accessdate=September 21, 2014 |publisher=Biodiversity BC |title=Importance of biodiversity for First Peoples of British Columbia |first=Nancy |last=Turner |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of British Columbia}}

===First Nations (Aboriginal) history===
{{main|Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples}}
The area now known as British Columbia is home to First Nations groups that have a deep history with a significant number of indigenous languages. There are more than 200 First Nations in BC. Prior to contact (with non-Aboriginal people), human history is known from oral histories of First Nations groups, archaeological investigations, and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period.

The arrival of [[Paleoindians]] from [[Beringia]] took place between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muckle2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert James |last=Muckle |title=The First Nations of British Columbia: An Anthropological Survey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11ii63EytIYC&amp;pg=PA18 |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0-7748-4010-1 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter-gatherer]] families were the main social structure from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;BastianMitchell2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dawn Elaine |last1=Bastian |first2=Judy K. |last2=Mitchell |title=Handbook of Native American Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsyQu1kDK-kC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-533-9 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nomadic population lived in non-permanent structures foraging for nuts, berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BastianMitchell2004&quot;/&gt; Around 5,000 years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally. Thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more [[sedentary lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BastianMitchell2004&quot;/&gt; These indigenous populations evolved over the next 5,000 years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs.

To the northwest of the province are the peoples of the [[Na-Dene languages]], which include the [[Athapaskan languages|Athapaskan-speaking peoples]] and the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], who lived on the islands of southern Alaska and northern British Columbia. The Na-Dene language group is believed to be linked to the [[Yeniseian languages]] of Siberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;BENGTSON&quot; /&gt; The [[Dene]] of the western Arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from Asia to North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;BENGTSON&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Bengtson |first=J.D |year=2008 |url=http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/dene_gr.pdf |title=Materials for a Comparative Grammar of the Dene-Caucasian (Sino-Caucasian) Languages – In Aspects of Comparative Linguistics |volume=3 |pages=45–118 |publisher=Moscow- RSUH |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Columbia Interior|Interior of British Columbia]] was home to the [[Salishan languages|Salishan language]] groups such as the [[Secwepemc|Shuswap (Secwepemc)]], [[Okanagan people|Okanagan]] and Athabaskan language groups, primarily the [[Dakelh]] (Carrier) and the [[Chilcotin people|Tsilhqot'in]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Archives&quot; /&gt; The inlets and valleys of the [[British Columbia Coast]] sheltered large, distinctive populations, such as the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] and [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]], sustained by the region's abundant salmon and shellfish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archives&quot; /&gt; These peoples developed [[Complex society|complex cultures]] dependent on the [[western red cedar]] that included wooden houses, seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved [[potlatch]] items and [[totem poles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Archives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/timemach/galler07/frames/wc_peop.htm |publisher=BC Archives |title=First Nations – People of the Northwest Coast |year=1999 |accessdate=April 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314102800/http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/timemach/galler07/frames/wc_peop.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with Europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from Europe the people had no immunity to.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Robert T. &quot;Demographic History, 1774–1874&quot; in Handbook of North American Indians: 7 the Northwest Coast. Smithsonian Institution. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a dramatic population collapse, culminating in the 1862 Smallpox outbreak in Victoria that spread throughout the coast. European settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of British Columbia. Colonial officials deemed colonists could make better use of the land than the First Nations people, and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, Mary. &quot;Colonialism/ Imperialism&quot; in Key Concepts in Political Geography. Sage Publications. 2009.120&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land, First Nations were forcibly relocated onto [[Indian reserve|reserves]], which were often too small to support their way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, Mary. &quot;Colonialism/ Imperialism&quot; in Key Concepts in Political Geography. Sage Publications. 2009. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, British Columbia had over 1500 reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, Mary. &quot;Colonialism/ Imperialism&quot; in Key Concepts in Political Geography.

===Fur trade and colonial era===
{{See also|Oregon boundary dispute}}
The British, during the colonial period, spread across the world claiming territories and building the [[British Empire]]. Lands now known as British Columbia were added to the empire during the 19th century. Originally established under the auspices of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], colonies were established (Vancouver Island, the mainland) that were amalgamated, then entered Confederation as British Columbia in 1871 as part of the Dominion of Canada.

During the 1770s, [[smallpox]] killed at least 30% of the Pacific Northwest [[First Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lange |first=Greg |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5100 |title=Smallpox epidemic ravages Native Americans on the northwest coast of North America in the 1770s |publisher=Historylink.org |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This devastating epidemic was the first in a series; the Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1862 killed 50% of the native population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.php?id=4547 |title=Plagues and Peoples on the Northwest Coast |publisher=.h-net.msu.edu |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227194037/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.php?id=4547 |archive-date=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kwakiutl house pole InvMH975-123-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwakwaka'wakw]] [[Totem pole|house pole]], second half of the 19th century]]
The arrival of Europeans began around the mid-18th century, as [[fur trade]]rs entered the area to harvest [[sea otter]]s. While it is thought [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the [[Pacific coast]], first made by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] in 1513.

The explorations of [[James Cook]] in 1778 and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792–93 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of [[Dean Channel]] near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and other explorers—notably [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], [[Samuel Black]], &lt;!--also John Campbell and others but they're less well-known, though in some ways no less important; Black in particular--&gt;and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]—were primarily concerned with extending the [[fur trade]], rather than political considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.

The establishment of [[trading post]]s under the auspices of the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District was broadly defined as being south of 54°40 north latitude, (the southern limit of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]]), north of Mexican-controlled California, and west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was, by the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], under the &quot;joint occupancy and use&quot; of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846.

The major supply route was the [[York Factory Express]] between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Fort Vancouver]]. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St. John (established 1794); [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]] (1805); [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] (1805); [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]] (1806); [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (1807); Kamloops (1812); [[Fort Langley, British Columbia|Fort Langley]] (1827); [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843); [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include [[Vancouver, Washington]] ([[Fort Vancouver]]), formerly the &quot;capital&quot; of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, [[Colville, Washington]] and [[Walla Walla, Washington]] (old [[Fort Nez Percés]]).

[[File:Edward Gennys Fanshawe, Fort Rupert, Beaver Harbour, Vancouver's Island, July 23rd 1851 (Canada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Rupert]], Vancouver Island, 1851]]
With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, modern-day British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the [[Thompson River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca District]], headquartered in [[Fort Chipewyan, Alberta|Fort Chipewyan]], in present-day Alberta.

Until 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of [[British North America]] under the [[de facto]] jurisdiction of HBC administrators; however, unlike [[Rupert's Land]] to the north and east, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern [[Columbia River drainage basin|Columbia Basin]] (within present day Washington and [[Oregon]]). In 1846, the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the territory along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Strait of Georgia]], with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, &quot;administered&quot; by individual HBC trading post managers.

===Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)===
{{Main|Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)|Richard Clement Moody}}

With the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial office]] to designate the mainland as the Colony of British Columbia. When news of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] reached London, Richard Clement Moody was hand-picked by the [[Colonial Office]], under [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire's &quot;bulwark in the farthest west&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald J. Hauka 2003, p.146&quot;/&gt; and &quot;found a second England on the shores of the Pacific&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean Barman p.71&quot;/&gt; Lytton desired to send to the colony &quot;representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force&quot;: he sought men who possessed &quot;courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Laura Elaine |title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862 |year=1983 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the &quot;English gentleman and British Officer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Laura Elaine |title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862 |year=1983 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the head of the [[Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment]].

Moody and his family arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, commanding the [[Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment]]. He was sworn in as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]] and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired [[Robert Burnaby]] as his personal secretary.

In British Columbia, Moody &quot;wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness&quot; and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, &quot;styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott26&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Laura Elaine |title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862 |year=1983 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the enactment of the ''Pre-emption Act'' of 1860, Moody settled the [[Lower Mainland]]. He selected the site and founded the new capital, [[New Westminster]]. He selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott26&quot;/&gt; He was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site, writing in his letter to Blackwood,

Moody designed the first [[Coat of arms of British Columbia]]; however, Lord Lytton &quot;forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town&quot; and the efforts of Moody's engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds, which, together with the continuous opposition of [[James Douglas (governor)|Douglas]], &quot;made it impossible for Moody's design to be fulfilled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldicscienceheraldique.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Laura Elaine |title=The Imposition of British Culture as Portrayed in the New Westminster Capital Plan of 1859 to 1862 |year=1983 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network, including what would become [[Kingsway (Vancouver)|Kingsway]], connecting New Westminster to [[False Creek]], the North Road between [[Port Moody]] and New Westminster, and the [[Cariboo Road]] and [[Stanley Park]]. He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot &quot;Mary Hill&quot; after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated &quot;government reserves&quot;, which included [[Stanley Park]] as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The ''Pre-emption Act'' did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for [[land grabbing]]. [[Port Moody]] is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US.

By 1862, the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]]) up the [[Fraser Canyon]] to the prospecting region around [[Barkerville]]. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening [[sawmill]]s, and engaging in [[fishery|fishing]] and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of [[responsible government]] began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the [[New Westminster]] ''British Columbian'' and future [[Premier of British Columbia|premier]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]]. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally, the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor.

===Later gold rushes===

A series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] and [[Lillooet]], which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–71)|succeeded in 1866]], when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] to form the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–71)]], which was, in turn, succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1871.

===Rapid growth and development===
[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]] drives the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], November 7, 1885. Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]

The Confederation League, including such figures as [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]], and [[Robert Beaven]], led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). Several factors motivated this agitation, including the fear of annexation to the United States, the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush.

[[File:Craigellachie (Gedenkstein).jpg|thumb|Memorial to the &quot;last spike&quot; in Craigellachie]]
With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on July 20, 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled. The Treaty of Washington sent the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in 1871 and in 1903, the province's territory shrank again after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].

Population in British Columbia continued to expand as the province's [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fishery|fishing]] sectors were developed. Mining activity was particularly notable throughout the Mainland, particularly in the [[Boundary Country]], in the [[Slocan Valley|Slocan]], in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]] around [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], the East Kootenay (the southeast corner of the province), the Fraser Canyon, the [[Cariboo District|Cariboo]], the [[Omineca Country|Omineca]] and the [[Cassiar Country|Cassiar]], so much so a common epithet for the Mainland, even after provincehood, was &quot;the Gold Colony&quot;.&lt;!--cite is the Akriggs, and Howay, and Ormsby, and others--&gt; Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley, and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson River area, the Cariboo, the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]], and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.

The completion of the railway in 1885 was a huge boost to the province's economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, known as [[Gastown]], near the mouth of the [[Burrard Inlet]] was selected as the terminus of the railway, prompting the incorporation of the City as Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the [[Port of Vancouver]] spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], as the largest in [[Western Canada]]. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically, its settlement and development—were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources (such as the fishery).

Establishing a [[labor force|labour force]] to develop the province was problematic from the start, and British Columbia was the locus of immigration from Europe, China, Japan and India. The influx of a non-[[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation (much of it successful) to restrict the ability of [[Asian people]] to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of a [[Tax per head|head tax]]. This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. The subsequent [[Komagata Maru incident]] in 1914, where hundreds of Indians were denied entry into Vancouver, was also a direct result of the anti-Asian resentment at the time. By 1923, almost all [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese immigration had been blocked]] except for merchants, professionals, students and investors.

Meanwhile, the province continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line, the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk Pacific]], linking north-central British Columbia from the [[Yellowhead Pass]] through Prince George to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] was driven at [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]]. This opened up the [[British Columbia Coast|North Coast]] and the [[Bulkley Valley]] region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.

In [[World War I]], the province responded strongly to the call to assist the British Empire against its German foes in French and Belgian battlefields. About 55,570 of the 400,000 British Columbian residents, the highest per-capita rate in Canada, responded to the military needs. Horseriders from the province's Interior region and First Nations soldiers made contributions to Vimy Ridge and other battles. About 6,225 men from the province died in combat.&lt;ref&gt;British Columbia History magazine vol.48 no.2 Summer 2015, Book Review – From the West Coast to the Western Front: British Columbians and the Great War by Greg Dickson and Mark Forsythe&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s to 1940s===
When the men returned from the [[First World War]], they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hard-core drinking Vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war. Because of pressure from veterans, prohibition was quickly relaxed so the &quot;soldier and the working man&quot; could enjoy a drink, but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of &quot;soldier parties&quot; to represent their interests, variously named Soldier-Farmer, Soldier-Labour, and [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Farmer-Labour]] Parties. These formed the basis of the fractured labour-political spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties, including those who would eventually form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-operative Commonwealth]] and the early [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] splinter groups.
[[File:Japanese internment camp in British Columbia.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Canadian internment|Internment camp]] for [[Japanese Canadians]] during [[World War II]]]]

The advent of [[prohibition in the United States]] created new opportunities, and many found employment or at least profit in cross-border liquor smuggling. Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this &quot;pirate economy&quot;, although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. By the end of the 1920s, the end of prohibition in the U.S., combined with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], plunged the province into economic destitution during the 1930s. Compounding the already dire local economic situation, tens of thousands of men from colder parts of Canada swarmed into Vancouver, creating huge [[hobo]] jungles around [[False Creek]] and the Burrard Inlet [[Classification yard|rail yards]], including the old Canadian Pacific Railway mainline [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] through the heart of the [[Downtown Vancouver|city's downtown]] (at Hastings and Carrall). Increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts, an occupation of the main Post Office at [[Granville Street|Granville]] and [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of [[martial law]] on the docks for almost three years. A Vancouver contingent for the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] was organized and seized a train, which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a [[Gatling gun]] straddling the tracks at [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]; the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carved From Wood; Mission, BC, 1861–1992'' |first=Andreas |last=Schroeder |publisher=The Mission Foundation |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-55056-131-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce as never before.

British Columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the Pacific Ocean to have close relations with [[East Asia]]. This closeness has often caused friction between cultures which has sometimes escalted into racist animosity towards those of Asian descent. This was most manifest during the Second World War when many people of [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese descent were relocated]] or interned in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior region]] of the province.

===Coalition and the post-war boom===
[[File:British Columbia Regiment 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own)|BC Regiment (DCOR)]], marching in [[New Westminster]], 1940]]
During the [[Second World War]] the mainstream [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] and [[British Columbia Conservative Party|BC Conservative]] Parties of British Columbia united in a formal [[coalition government]] under new Liberal leader [[John Hart (Canadian politician)|John Hart]], who replaced [[Thomas Dufferin Pattullo|Duff Pattullo]] when the latter failed to win a majority in the [[1941 British Columbia general election|1941 election]]. While the Liberals won the most seats, they actually received fewer votes than the socialist [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). Pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival Conservatives led by [[Royal Maitland]] and was replaced by Hart, who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five Liberal and three Conservative ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;con&quot; /&gt; The CCF was invited to join the coalition but refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;con&quot; /&gt;

The pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of the Second World War was to prevent the CCF, which had won a surprise victory in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1944, from ever coming to power in British Columbia. The CCF's popular vote was high enough in the [[1945 British Columbia general election|1945 election]] that they were likely to have won three-way contests and could have formed government; however, the coalition prevented that by uniting the anti-[[socialism|socialist]] vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;con&quot; /&gt; In the post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the completion of [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] north of Prince George to the Peace River Block, a section called the John Hart Highway and also public hospital insurance.

In 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken over by [[Byron Ingemar Johnson]]. The Conservatives had wanted their new leader [[Herbert Anscomb]] to be premier, but the Liberals in the Coalition refused. Johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in British Columbia history (61%) in the [[1949 British Columbia general election|1949 election]]. This victory was attributable to the popularity of his government's spending programmes, despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power. During his tenure, major infrastructures continued to expand, such as the agreement with [[Rio Tinto Alcan|Alcan Aluminum]] to build the town of [[Kitimat, British Columbia|Kitimat]] with an aluminum smelter and the large [[Kemano Generating Station|Kemano Hydro Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Boom in the Big Triangle |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=June 1952 |pages=102–107/246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the 1948 flooding of the Fraser Valley, which was a major blow to that region and to the province's economy.

On February 13, 1950, a [[1950 British Columbia B-36 crash|Convair B-36B crashed]] in northern British Columbia after jettisoning a [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|Mark IV]] [[atomic bomb]]. This was the first such [[United States military nuclear incident terminology|nuclear weapon loss]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Object found off British Columbia coast not missing nuke|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38112808|website=BBC News|date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing tension between the Liberal and Conservative coalition partners led the Liberal Party executive to vote to instruct Johnson to terminate the arrangement. Johnson ended the coalition and dropped his Conservative cabinet ministers, including [[Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy Premier]] and [[Finance minister]] Herbert Anscomb, precipitating the [[1952 British Columbia general election|general election of 1952]].&lt;ref name=&quot;con&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michelmann |first1=Hans |last2=Smith |first2=David |last3=De Clercy |first3=Cristine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7iLYjWHvS8C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=herbert+anscomb+conservative#PPA184,M1 |title=Continuity And Change in Canadian Politics: Essays in Honour of David E. Smith |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2006 |page=184|isbn=9780802090607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A referendum on electoral reform &lt;!--in 1950? I think; BC referenda/plebiscites need a history/list article of their own--&gt; prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a [[Ranked voting systems|preferential ballot]]), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%.

The Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA [[W. A. C. Bennett]], formed a [[minority government]] backed by the Liberals and Conservatives (with 6 and 4 seats respectively). Bennett began a series of fiscal reforms, preaching a new variety of [[populism]] as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development, laying the ground for a [[1953 British Columbia general election|second election in 1953]] in which the new Bennett regime secured a majority of seats, with 38% of the vote. Secure with that majority, Bennett returned the province to the first-past-the-post system thereafter, which is still in use.

===1952–1960s===
With the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked on a phase of rapid [[economic development]]. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.

During these two decades, the government [[Nationalization|nationalized]] British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity [[BC Hydro]]. [[West Kootenay Power and Light]] remained independent of BC Hydro, being owned and operated by [[Cominco]], though tied into the regional power grid. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Columbia, and [[Nechako River]] watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to [[Kemano]], was to supply power to the [[Alcan Inc.]] aluminum smelter at [[Kitimat]], and was not part of the provincial power grid but [[Independent Power Producers in British Columbia|privately owned]]). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the [[Columbia River Treaty]] between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.

The 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established [[BC Ferries]] as a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]], to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system, also supported by federal grants as being part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.

Vancouver and Victoria became cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and ''haute cuisine'' chefs flocked to its scenery and warmer temperatures, with the cultural and entrepreneurial community bolstered by many [[Draft dodgers]] from the United States. Tourism also played a role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a boost to British Columbia's economy, primarily because of exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Politically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the [[labour movement]], sharpened as so-called [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by Social Credit—in opposition to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between [[hippie]]s and [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver mayor]] [[Tom Campbell (Canadian politician)|Tom Campbell]] was particularly legendary, culminating in the [[Gastown riots]] of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.

===1970s and 1980s===
On August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector, but BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070614185856/http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2007 |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871–1986 |author=Elections BC |year=1998 |accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) government under [[Dave Barrett]]. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} although changes to the accounting system makes it likely some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its &quot;[[two sets of books]]&quot;, as WAC Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three-year (&quot;Thousand Days&quot;) period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]], a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.

Perceptions the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the [[1975 British Columbia general election|1975 general election]]. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[Bill Bennett]], was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the [[Ministry of Forests]], reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP—notably the creation of the [[Whistler, British Columbia|Resort Municipality of Whistler]], whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.

Also during the &quot;MiniWac&quot; regime (a reference to his father's acronym, WAC) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were &quot;privatized&quot; in a mass giveaway of shares in the [[British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation]], &quot;BCRIC&quot;, with the &quot;Brick shares&quot; soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several [[megaproject]]s meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of [[Expo 86]], to which was tied the construction of the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] and Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the [[Doman Scandal]], in which the premier and millionaire backer Herb Doman were investigated for insider-trading and [[securities fraud]]. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.

[[File:Coquilhalla Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Coquihalla Highway]] was one of the legacies of the [[Expo 86]] [[world's fair]], though creation of the [[toll road|toll highway]] sparked controversy.]]

As the province entered a sustained [[recession]], Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Henry Pybus Bell-Irving]], was forced to call Bennett to [[Government House (British Columbia)|Government House]] to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]] no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, Bennett won an unexpected majority.

After several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|House]] was finally called and in the [[speech from the throne]] the Socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed &quot;restraint&quot;, which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to &quot;motherhood&quot; issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people.

This became known as the 1983 [[Solidarity Crisis]], from the name of the [[Solidarity Coalition]], a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour]] forming a separate organization of unions, [[Operation Solidarity]], under the direction of [[Jack Munro]], then-President of the [[International Woodworkers of America]] (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt a [[general strike]] would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at [[Pacific Press Publishing Association|Pacific Press]] ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Bryan |title=Solidarity: The Rise and Fall of an Opposition in British Columbia |publisher=New Star Books |year=1987 |location=Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party [[grande dame]] [[Grace McCarthy]], and the charismatic but eccentric [[Bill Vander Zalm]].

Bill Vander Zalm became the new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a [[conflict of interest]] scandal following the sale of [[Fantasy Gardens]], a Christian and [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]] [[Amusement park|theme park]] built by the Premier, to [[Tan Yu]], a [[Filipino Chinese]] gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor [[Faye Leung]] of a party in the &quot;Howard Hughes Suite&quot; on the top two floors of the [[Bayshore Inn]], where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a [[bag of money]] in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and [[Rita Johnston]] became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor [[Mike Harcourt]].

In 1988, [[David Lam (real estate entrepreneur)|David Lam]] was appointed as British Columbia's twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor, and was the province's first Lieutenant-Governor of Chinese origin.

Johnston lost the [[1991 British Columbia general election|1991 general election]] to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the province's growing [[tourism]] sector, although the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over &quot;[[Bingogate]]&quot;—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. [[Glen Clark]], a former president of the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour|BC Federation of Labour]], was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the [[Fast Ferry Scandal]] involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the Premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by [[Dan Miller (Canadian politician)|Dan Miller]] who was in turn followed by [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] following a leadership convention.

In the 2001 general election [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]'s BC Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the &quot;fast ferries&quot; project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of [[BC Rail]] to CN Rail. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] during a vacation in Hawaii, but he still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 general election against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the [[2009 British Columbia general election|2009 provincial election]], marking the first time in 23 years a premier has been elected to a third term.

The province won a bid to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver and Whistler. As promised in his 2002 re-election campaign, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell staged a non-binding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the Olympics. In February 2003, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wallechinsky |first1=D. |last2=Loucky |first2=J. |year=2010 |title=The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics: 2010 Edition |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Christy Clark by Kris Krug 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Christy Clark was Premier of British Columbia from 2011 until 2017.]]
After the Olympic joy had faded, Campbell's popularity started to fall. His management style, the implementation of the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) against election promises and the cancelling of the [[BC Legislature Raids|BC Rail corruption trial]] lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support. He would resign in November 2010 and call on the party to elect a new leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-premier-campbell-stepping-down-1.911669 |title=BC Premier Campbell stepping down |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, former Deputy Premier [[Christy Clark]] became leader of the Liberal Party. Though she was not a sitting MLA, she went on to win the seat left vacant by Campbell. For the next two years, she attempted to distance herself from the unpopularity of Campbell and forge an image for [[2013 British Columbia general election|the upcoming 2013 election]]. Among her early accomplishments were raising the minimum wage, creating a new statutory holiday in February called &quot;Family Day&quot;, and pushing the development of BC's [[liquified natural gas]] industry. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP by a double-digit gap in the polls, but were able to achieve a surprise victory on election night, winning a majority and making Clark the first elected woman premier in BC history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/christy-clark-leads-b-c-liberals-to-surprise-majority-1.1315526 |date=May 15, 2013 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |title=Christy Clark leads BC Liberals to surprise majority}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate [[David Eby]], she later won a by-election in the riding of [[Westside-Kelowna]]. Her government would go on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]].
[[File:John Horgan 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|John Horgan has been Premier of British Columbia since 2017.]]

In [[2017 British Columbia general election|the 2017 election]], the NDP formed a minority government with the support of the Green Party through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence and supply agreement]]. The NDP and Green caucuses together control 44 seats, compared to the Liberals' 43. On July 18, 2017, NDP leader John Horgan was officially sworn in as premier of British Columbia. He was the province's first NDP premier in 16 years.

British Columbia was also significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to [[China]]. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades,{{when|date=January 2019}} because of its natural environment, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but has been particularly true during periods of economic growth.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} British Columbia has moved from approximately 10% of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13% in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean the [[Greater Vancouver]] area now includes 51% of the province's population, followed by [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] with 8%. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.

By 2018, housing prices Vancouver were the second-least affordable in the world, behind only Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/hong-kong-housing-ranked-world-s-least-affordable-for-9th-year&lt;/ref&gt; Many experts point to evidence of money-laundering from mainland China as a contributing factor. The high price of residential real estate has led to the implementation of an empty homes tax, a housing speculation and vacancy tax, and a foreign buyers' tax on housing.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Gaming_Final_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The net number of people coming to BC from other [[province]]s has grown almost four times larger since 2012. BC was the largest net recipient of [[Interprovincial migration in Canada|interprovincial migrants in Canada]] in the first quarter of 2016 with half of the 5,000 people coming from [[Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tara |last=Carman |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/canadians-flock-to-b-c-in-search-of-jobs |title=Canadians flock to B.C. in search of jobs |work=The Vancouver Sun |date=August 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Half of all British Columbians live in the Metro Vancouver area, which includes Vancouver, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[New Westminster]], [[West Vancouver]], [[North Vancouver (city)]], [[North Vancouver (district municipality)]], [[Burnaby]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Port Coquitlam]], [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]], [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley (city)]], [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley (district municipality)]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Pitt Meadows]], [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Port Moody]], [[Anmore]], [[Belcarra]], [[Lions Bay, British Columbia|Lions Bay]] and [[Bowen Island]], with adjacent unincorporated areas (including the [[University Endowment Lands]]) represented in the regional district as the [[List of regional district electoral areas in British Columbia|electoral area]] known as [[Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A, British Columbia|Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A]]. The metropolitan area has [[List of First Nations governments in British Columbia|seventeen Indian reserves]], but they are outside of the regional district's jurisdiction and are not represented in its government.

The second largest concentration of British Columbia population is at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, which is made up of the 13 municipalities of Greater Victoria, [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Saanich, British Columbia|Saanich]], [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]], [[Oak Bay, British Columbia|Oak Bay]], [[View Royal, British Columbia|View Royal]], [[Highlands, British Columbia|Highlands]], [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]], [[Langford, British Columbia|Langford]], [[Central Saanich, British Columbia|Central Saanich]]/[[Saanichton, British Columbia|Saanichton]], [[North Saanich, British Columbia|North Saanich]], [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]], [[Metchosin, British Columbia|Metchosin]], [[Sooke, British Columbia|Sooke]], which are part of the [[Capital Regional District]]. The metropolitan area also includes several [[Indian reserve]]s (the governments of which are not part of the regional district). Almost half of the Vancouver Island population is in Greater Victoria.

==Economy==
[[File:Canada Place with Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Masson.jpg|thumb|Canada Place in Downtown Vancouver]]
BC's economy is diverse, with service-producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the province's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fin.gov.bc.ca/tbs/F&amp;Ereview14.pdf |title=2014 British Columbia Financial and Economic Review, 74th Edition April 2013 – March 2014 |publisher=BC Ministry of Finance |date=July 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the terminus of two transcontinental railways, and the site of 27 major marine cargo and passenger terminals. Though less than 5% of its vast {{convert|944735|km2|abbr=on}} land is [[arable land|arable]], the province is agriculturally rich (particularly in the [[Fraser Valley|Fraser]] and [[Okanagan]] valleys), because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys. Its climate encourages [[outdoor recreation]] and [[tourism]], though its economic mainstay has long been [[resource extraction]], principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city, serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average. While the coast of British Columbia and some valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada. The [[Interior of British Columbia|Northern Interior]] region has a [[subarctic climate]] with very cold winters. The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities, with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&amp;lang=e&amp;StationName=Vancouver&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&amp;dCode=1 |title=Canadian climate normals 1981–2010 Vancouver International Airport |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Columbia has a history of being a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. It now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west, comprising 72% of industry (compared to 60% Western Canadian average).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Chapter_9.pdf |work=State of the West 2010 |title=Economic output in the West |pages=103–109 |publisher=Canada West Foundation |accessdate=September 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812195015/http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Chapter_9.pdf |archivedate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest section of this employment is in finance, insurance, real estate and corporate management; however, many areas outside of metropolitan areas are still heavily reliant on resource extraction. With its film industry known as [[Hollywood North]], the Vancouver region is the third-largest feature film production location in North America, after [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm |title=Film and TV |publisher=Vancouver Economic Development |year=2005 |accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101014505/http://vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm |archivedate=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of [[Business cycle|dramatic upswings and downswings]], and this [[boom and bust]] pattern has influenced the politics, culture and business climate of the province. Economic activity related to mining in particular has widely fluctuated with changes in commodity prices over time, with documented costs to community health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2005/05oct06/mining.html |title=Hard on Health of Mining Communities |publisher=University of British Columbia |date=September 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070415163741/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2005/05oct06/mining.html | archive-date= April 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of British Columbia |Monarchy in British Columbia}}
[[File:British Columbia Parliament Buildings - Pano - HDR.jpg|thumb|centre|upright=3|The British Columbia Parliament Buildings in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]]]
{{clear}}
The Lieutenant-Governor, [[Janet Austin]], is the Queen of Canada's representative in the province. During the absence of the [[Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant-Governor]], the [[Cabinet of Canada|Governor General in Council]] may appoint an administrator to execute the duties of the office. In practice, this is usually the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|Chief Justice of British Columbia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

British Columbia has an 87-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the [[plurality voting system]], though from 2003 to 2009 there was significant debate about switching to a [[single transferable vote]] system called [[BC-STV]]. The government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios, what are officially part of the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]], of whom the premier is chair.

The province is governed by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (BC NDP) under Premier [[John Horgan]]. The 2017 provincial election saw the Liberal Party take 43 seats, the NDP take 41, and the [[British Columbia Green Party]] take 3. No party met the minimum of 44 seats for a majority, therefore leading to the first minority government since 1953. Following the election, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP, eventually announcing they would support the current NDP minority. Previously, the right-of-centre [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] governed the province for 16 years between 2001 and 2017, and won the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats. The legislature became more evenly divided between the Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 Liberal seats of 79) and 2009 (49 Liberal seats of 85) provincial elections. The NDP and its predecessor the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have ruled with majority governments in 1972–1975 and 1991–2001. The Green Party plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. After a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39%), the party's vote share declined (2005 – 9.17%, 2009 – 8.09%, 2013 – 8.13%) before increasing again to a record high of 16.84% at the 2017 election.

The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been [[third party (politics)|third parties]] present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Green Party]] are the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.

Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.

[[File:BC-Legislative-Assembly-Chamber.jpg|thumb|The meeting chamber of the Legislative Assembly]]
British Columbia is known for having politically active labour [[trade union|unions]] who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.

British Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to [[McGowan's War]] in 1858–59). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the [[Robert Bonner (politician)|Robert Bonner]] Affair and the [[Fantasy Gardens]] scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era. NDP scandals included Bingogate, which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, and the alleged scandal named Casinogate which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals plagued the 2001–2017 Liberal government, including Premier Gordon Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A Christmas Eve{{which|date=April 2015}} [[BC Legislature Raids|raid on the Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}{{Update inline|date=February 2020}} Campbell eventually resigned in late 2010 due to opposition to his government's plan to introduce a [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) and was replaced by [[Christy Clark]] as premier in a 2011 BC Liberal leadership election.

British Columbia is underrepresented in the [[Senate of Canada]], leading Premier Christy Clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal government's reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use non-partisan criteria. Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December 3, 2015, Clark issued a statement that it did &quot;not address what's been wrong with the Senate since the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Galloway |first=Gloria |date=December 3, 2015 |title=Liberals to set up advisory board for Senate nominees, but BC won't take part |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-setting-up-advisory-board-to-fill-empty-senate-seats/article27577333/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imbalance in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size. The six senators from BC constitute only one for every 775,000 people vs. one for every 75,000 in P.E.I. which has four senators. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have much smaller populations than BC, yet each has ten senators according to a Global News summary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldrey&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2379480/why-christy-clark-is-rejecting-justin-trudeaus-reform-of-the-senate/ |title=Why Christy Clark is rejecting Justin Trudeau's reform of the Senate |last=Baldrey |first=Keith |date=December 3, 2015 |website=Global News |publisher=Shaw Media Inc. |access-date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment, but that is unlikely to be supported by the Atlantic provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldrey&quot;/&gt;

In April 2016 the government of British Columbia declared a public health emergency due to overdoses on the illicit opioid [[Fentanyl]]. {{as of|2016|November|}}, there had been 755 cases of Fentanyl overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/12/26/vancouver-and-bcs-fentanyl-crisis.html |title=2016 in Review: Vancouver and B.C.'s fentanyl crisis &amp;#124; Metro Vancouver |publisher=Metronews.ca |date=December 26, 2016 |accessdate=April 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312033109/http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/12/26/vancouver-and-bcs-fentanyl-crisis.html |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Transportation played a huge role in British Columbia's history. The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around [[Cape Horn]] or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.

Until the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the [[Crowsnest Highway|Crowsnest Pass Highway]]), and later the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.

===Roads and highways===
{{Main|List of British Columbia provincial highways}}
[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge from below.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] on [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] between Richmond and Delta]]
Because of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now [[controlled-access highway|freeways]] in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane [[arterial road|arterial highways]] with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.
[[File:Highway 1, Burnaby.jpg|alt=|thumb|British Columbia Highway 1 near Brentwood, Burnaby]]
A couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median [[traffic barrier]]s. [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] on [[Vancouver Island]] and Highway 97 through the [[Okanagan Valley]] are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from 50&amp;nbsp;km/h to maximums just slightly lower than the principal [[grade-separated]] highways. Numerous [[traffic light]]s operate in place of [[interchange (road)|interchanges]] on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] and Infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;BC highways&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=BC ministry of transportation and infrastructure |title=BC highways |year=2013 |url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/tran/ |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: [[British Columbia provincial highway 3|BC Highway 3]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], the [[Vermilion Pass]] (Highway 93 in both [[British Columbia Highway 93|British Columbia]] and [[Alberta Highway 93|Alberta]]), the [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through [[Banff National Park]], the [[Yellowhead Highway]] (16) through [[Jasper National Park]], and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] through [[Dawson Creek]]. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running {{convert|2081|km|abbr=on}} from the British Columbia-Washington border at [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] north to [[Watson Lake, Yukon]] and which includes the British Columbia portion of the [[Alaska Highway]].

===Public transit===
Prior to 1979, surface [[public transport|public transit]] was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established [[BC Transit]] to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority ([[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]) (now South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority), a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District was established. Some smaller island communities, such as [[Gabriola Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History: GERTIE: Gabriola's Environmentally Responsible Trans Island Express |url=https://gabriolacommunitybus.com/about/history/ |website=GERTIE |accessdate=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, formerly, [[Pender Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Bus |url=http://penderbus.org/about |website=Pender Island Community Bus |accessdate=November 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113210800/http://penderbus.org/about |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Bus Pilot Project Ending |url=http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |website=Pender Island Community Bus |publisher=Pender Island Community Bus |accessdate=January 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110235046/http://penderbus.org/routes/alerts#alert-23 |archive-date=January 10, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; operate routes independent of BC Transit or TransLink. BC Transit has recently expanded to provide intercity routes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McElroy |first1=Justin |title=B.C. government launches new bus service for northern half of the province |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-northern-bus-transit-may-2018-1.4683199 |accessdate=November 13, 2018 |agency=CBC |publisher=CBC |date=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the Northern region of British Columbia. Other intercity routes were introduced connecting southern communities in preparation of the cancellation of [[Greyhound Canada]]'s pullout from Western Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health Connections |url=https://bctransit.com/kamloops/schedules-and-maps/health-connections |website=BC Transit Kamloops |publisher=BC Transit |accessdate=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though options for intercity bus travel are still extremely limited.

Public transit in British Columbia consists mainly of diesel buses, although Vancouver is also serviced by a fleet of [[trolleybus]]es. Several experimental buses are being tested such as [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] buses that have both gasoline and electric engines. Additionally, there are CNG-fueled buses being tested and used in Nanaimo and Kamloops systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bctransit.com/*/about/fleet |title=Our Fleet |publisher=BC Transit |accessdate=April 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818214911/https://bctransit.com/*/about/fleet |archive-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Columbia also tested a fleet of Hydrogen-fueled buses for the Vancouver-Whistler Winter Olympics in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chfca.ca/say-h2i/cars-and-buses/bc-transit-fuel-cell-bus-fleet |title=Case Study – BC Transit Fuel Cell Bus Fleet |publisher=Chfca.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330182706/http://www.chfca.ca/say-h2i/cars-and-buses/bc-transit-fuel-cell-bus-fleet |archive-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TransLink operates [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], an automated [[rapid transit|metro]] system serving the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, North Surrey and Richmond. In 2009, the Canada Line SkyTrain was completed, linking Vancouver International Airport and the city of Richmond to downtown Vancouver bringing the total to three operating metro lines.

A new line to Coquitlam and [[Port Moody]] (the [[Evergreen Extension]] of the [[Millennium Line]]) was completed in December 2016. There is planning for an extension of the Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the [[University of British Columbia]]. Turnstiles have been added to all existing stations in the system. In the past, SkyTrain used a proof of payment honour system. In the capital city of Victoria BC Transit and the provincial government's infrastructure ministry are working together to create a bus rapid transit from the Westshore communities to downtown Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bctransit.com/victoria/transit-future/victoria-transit-priority-corridors |title=BC Transit – 404 – Page Not Found |publisher=bctransit.com |accessdate=May 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509141533/http://bctransit.com/victoria/transit-future/victoria-transit-priority-corridors |archive-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kamloops]], there is a bus rapid transit GPS trial underway to see how bus rapid transit affects smaller cities, rather than larger ones, like Victoria and Vancouver.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Rail===
{{see also|Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia}}
[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|upright|CPR train traversing the [[Stoney Creek Bridge]]]]

Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was completed, in 1885, and was the chief mode of long-distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the 1950s. Two major routes through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway – the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], terminating at [[Prince Rupert]], and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], terminating at Vancouver.

The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] provided rail services in Victoria and Vancouver between the nineteenth century and mid twentieth century.

The [[Pacific Great Eastern]] line supplemented this service, providing a north–south route between interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] with [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]]. The E&amp;N Railway, rebranded as [[Southern Railway of Vancouver Island]], formerly served the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island. Service along the route is now minimal. Vancouver Island was also host to the [[Englewood Railway|last logging railway in North America]] until its closure in 2017.

Current passenger services in British Columbia are limited. [[Via Rail Canada]] operates six long distance trains on two lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Via Rail Timetable |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/VIARail_Timetable.pdf |website=Via Rail Canada |publisher=Via Rail Canada |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local services are limited to two regions, with [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] providing rapid transit and commuter services in the [[Lower Mainland]] and by the [[Seton Lake Indian Band]] South of [[Lillooet]] with the [[Kaoham Shuttle]]. [[Amtrak]] runs international passenger service between Vancouver, [[Seattle]], and intermediate points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Train Schedules |url=https://www.amtrakcascades.com/our-train-schedules |website=Amtrak Cascades |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Heritage Railway]]s operate within the province, including the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] runs between [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]], via British Columbia.

===Water===
[[BC Ferries]] was established as a provincial crown corporation in 1960 to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway and other private operators. It now operates 25 routes among the [[List of islands of British Columbia|islands of British Columbia]], as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the [[Washington State Ferries]] (between [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]]) and [[MV Coho|Black Ball Transport]] (between Victoria and [[Port Angeles, Washington]]). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the provincial government. Various other coastal ferries are operated privately.

Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are at Vancouver, [[Roberts Bank]] (near [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]), [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], and Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=909&amp;Itemid=98 |title=International Shipping in British Columbia |accessdate=September 21, 2014 |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729172613/http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=909&amp;Itemid=98 |archivedate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosbc.ca/images/docs/BCPortsHandbook2014.pdf |publisher=Chamber of Shipping of BC |title=''BC Ports handbook''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these, the [[Port of Vancouver]] is the most important, being the largest in Canada and the most diversified in North America.

Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for [[cruise ship]]s. In 2007, a large maritime [[Containerization|container port]] was opened in [[Prince Rupert Port Authority|Prince Rupert]] with an inland sorting port in Prince George.

===Air===
{{Main|List of airports in British Columbia}}
There are over 200 airports throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the [[Vancouver International Airport]], the [[Victoria International Airport]], the [[Kelowna International Airport]], and the [[Abbotsford International Airport]], the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. {{As of|2017}}, Vancouver International Airport is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|2nd busiest airport]] in the country and the second biggest International Gateway on the west coast (after Los Angeles) with an estimated 17.9&amp;nbsp;million travellers passing through in 2008.

==Outdoor life==
[[File:Whistler ice sailor.jpg|thumb|Ice sailing in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]]]
[[File:Holland Point Shoreline Trail, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada 05.jpg|thumb|Shoreline Trail in Victoria]]
Given its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].

Water sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. [[Sea kayak]]ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its [[fjord]]s. [[Whitewater]] [[rafting]] and [[kayak]]ing are popular on many inland rivers. [[Sailing]] and [[Windsurfing|sailboarding]] are widely enjoyed.

In winter, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] and [[telemark skiing]] are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality [[Alpine skiing|downhill]] [[skiing]] has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the [[Columbia Mountains]]. [[Snowboarding]] has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] downhill events were held in [[Whistler Blackcomb]] area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.

In Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for [[jogging|joggers]] and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the [[Bicycle gearing|ten-speed]] bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust [[mountain bike]], trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. A 2016 poll on global biking website Pinkbike rated BC as the top destination mountain bikers would like to ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pinkbike.com/news/where-would-you-go-if-you-could-road-trip-anywhere-pinkbike-poll-2016.html |title=Where would you go, if you could road trip anywhere? – Pinkbike Poll |work=Pinkbike |access-date=March 2, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. [[Longboarding]] is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.

[[Equestrianism|Horseback riding]] is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for [[trail riding]], often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.

British Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[curling]], [[disc golf]], [[Ultimate Canada|Ultimate]] and [[figure skating]]. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and [[winter sport]]s.

Consistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of [[Luxury resort|lodges]], [[chalet]]s, [[bed and breakfast]]s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.

In certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting [[ecotourism]] in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the [[WWOOF]] Canada program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwoof.ca/ |title=WWOOF&amp;nbsp;– Willing Workers on Organic Farms, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
