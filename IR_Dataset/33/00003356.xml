'''William Jefferson Clinton''' (born '''William Jefferson Blythe III'''; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd [[president of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Prior to his presidency, he served as [[governor of Arkansas]] (1979–1981 and 1983–1992) and as [[attorney general of Arkansas]] (1977–1979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], and many of his policies reflected a [[Centrism|centrist]] &quot;[[Third Way]]&quot; political philosophy. He is the husband of former secretary of state and former U.S. senator [[Hillary Clinton]]. In 1998, [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], becoming the second U.S. president to get impeached following [[Andrew Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage |last=Fandos |first=Nicholas |last2=Shear |first2=Michael D |date=December 18, 2019 |title=Trump Impeached for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 19, 2019 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] for the purpose of concealing his [[Lewinsky scandal|affair]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]], a 22-year-old [[White House Internship Program|White House intern]]. He was acquitted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and completed his term in office.

Clinton was born and raised in [[Arkansas]] and attended [[Georgetown University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William J. Clinton Biography and Interview |publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/william-j-clinton/#interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University College, Oxford]], and [[Yale Law School]]. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the [[Attorney General of Arkansas|attorney general of Arkansas]], serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]]. Clinton was elected president in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], defeating incumbent Republican opponent [[George H. W. Bush]]. At age 46, he became the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|third-youngest president]] in history.

Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], but failed to pass his plan for [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|national health care reform]]. In the [[1994 United States elections|1994 elections]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[Republican Revolution|won unified control]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the first time in 40 years. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democrat since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to be elected to a second full term. He passed [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian]] and [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] wars, signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] in opposition to [[Saddam Hussein]], participated in the [[2000 Camp David Summit]] to advance the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian]] peace process, and assisted the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office [[approval rating]] of any U.S. president since [[World War II]], and has continually received high scores in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|the historical rankings of U.S. presidents]]. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the [[Clinton Foundation|William J. Clinton Foundation]] to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and [[global warming]]. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]''. In 2009, he was named the United Nations [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Special Envoy]] to [[Haiti]] and after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], he teamed with [[George W. Bush]] to form the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]]. In addition, he secured the release of [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea|two American journalists imprisoned by]] [[North Korea]], visiting the capital [[Pyongyang]] in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]].

Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-President-Bill-Clinton/3|title=Oprah Talks to Bill Clinton|work=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]] |date=August 2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, [[Roger Clinton Jr.]]; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First in His Class&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maraniss|first=David|title=First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton|publisher=Touchstone|year=1996|isbn=0-684-81890-6|url=https://archive.org/details/firstinhisclass00davi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]], where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; Clinton was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':{{block indent|Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official.

But I knew I could be great in public service.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;}}

Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient [[Roman Senator|Roman senator]] [[Catiline]] in a mock trial in his Latin class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/bill-clinton-facts_n_3497083.html | title=10 Things You Definitely Didn't Know About Bill Clinton | work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]] | date=June 25, 2013 | first=Jimmy | last=Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a vigorous defense that made use of his &quot;budding rhetorical and political skills&quot;, he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it &quot;made him realize that someday he would study law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton | first=David | last=Maraniss | year=1996 | publisher=Touchstone | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First in His Class&quot; /&gt; The other was watching [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s 1963 &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) | publisher=[[The White House]] | url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | accessdate=August 30, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719152125/http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | archivedate=July 19, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College and law school years==

===Georgetown University===

[[File:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|thumb|Clinton ran for president of the [[Georgetown University Student Association|Student Council]] while attending the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]].]]

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] degree in 1968.

In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for [[class president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Levin|title=Bill Clinton: The Inside Story|url=https://archive.org/details/billclinton00robe|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=SP Books|isbn=978-1-56171-177-2|pages=xxiv–xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apo.org/leadershipdevelopment | title=About Leadership | accessdate=April 7, 2013 | publisher=APO.org | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101064634/http://apo.org/Leadershipdevelopment | archivedate=January 1, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

===Oxford===

Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]], where he initially read for a [[B.Phil.]] in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|philosophy, politics, and economics]] but transferred to a [[B.Litt.]] in politics and, ultimately, a [[B.Phil.]] in politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-bill-clinton-we-knew-at-oxford-apart-from-smoking-dope-and-not-inhaling-what-else-did-he-learn-1556769.html|title=The Bill Clinton we knew at Oxford: Apart from smoking dope (and not inhaling), what else did he learn over here? College friends share their memories with Matthew Hoffman|first=Matthew|last=Hoffman|date=October 11, 1992|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at [[Yale Law School]], [[Yale University]], but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.&lt;ref name=&quot;First in His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowd&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/world/oxford-journal-whereas-he-is-an-old-boy-if-a-young-chief-honor-him.html | title=Oxford Journal; Whereas, He Is an Old Boy, If a Young Chief, Honor Him | last=Dowd | first=Maureen | author-link=Maureen Dowd | work=The New York Times | accessdate=July 17, 2009 | date=June 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Hitch-22: A Memoir | first=Christopher | last=Hitchens | chapter=Chris or Christopher? | pages=106–107 | publisher=Atlantic books | location= London, England | isbn= 978-1-84354-922-2| date=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar [[Frank Aller]]. In 1969, Aller received a [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft]] letter that mandated deployment to the [[Vietnam War]]. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/22/magazine/most-likely-to-succeed.html|title=Most Likely to Succeed|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|date=November 22, 1992|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; British writer and feminist [[Sara Maitland]] said of Clinton, &quot;I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; He also developed an interest in [[rugby union]], which he played at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Rugby Union for Dummies |first1=Nick | last1=Cain |first2=Greg | last2=Growden |lastauthoramp=yes | chapter=21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby | page=297 | edition=2 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | location= [[Chichester]], England | isbn=978-0-470-03537-5|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the [[University of Oxford]], specifically for being &quot;a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace&quot;, having &quot;a powerful collaborator in his wife,&quot; and for winning &quot;general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/doctor-without-a-thesis-bill-clinton-gets-an-oxford-degree-today-but-jonathan-eyals-verdict-on-his-1421189.html|title=Doctor without a thesis: Bill Clinton gets an Oxford degree today, but Jonathan Eyal's verdict on his term's work is: a disaster|first=Jonathan|last=Eyal|date=June 8, 1994|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy===

During the [[Vietnam War]], Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil A. Hamilton|title=Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfbt5NXvF64C&amp;pg=PA366|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0816-2|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Oxford, he participated in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War protests]] and organized a [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] event in October 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] or [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and he then made arrangements to join the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program at the [[University of Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M. Gillon|title=The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-U2IzI2r5YC|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-532278-1|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way &quot;to maintain my political viability within the system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Clinton | agency=The Associated Press | title=The 1992 Campaign; A Letter By Clinton On His Draft Deferment: 'A War I Opposed And Despised' | work=The New York Times | date=February 13, 1992 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/13/us/1992-campaign-letter-clinton-his-draft-deferment-war-opposed-despised.html | access-date=July 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers{{nbsp}}1 to 310 would be [[Draft lottery (1969)|drafted]] before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lauter |first=David |date=February 13, 1992 |title=Clinton Releases '69 Letter on ROTC and Draft Status |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-13/news/mn-2993_1_vietnam-war/2 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]], which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam.

After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. In 1974, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the [[Watergate scandal]]. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52&amp;nbsp;percent to 48&amp;nbsp;percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for [[Arkansas Attorney General|Arkansas attorney general]].

In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate [[Lynn Lowe]], a farmer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]].

Monroe Schwarzlose, of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]] in the general election that year.

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]]. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special [[Arkansas General Assembly|legislative session]]—the longest in Arkansas history.&lt;ref name=pendleton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pendleton|first1=Scott | title=Governor Gets High Marks for Public Education Reforms | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0721/21062.html | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=July 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;First in His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]] businessmen [[Woody Freeman]] (1984), and [[Sheffield Nelson]] of Little Rock (1990).&lt;ref name=AllPolitics1 /&gt;

News outlets labeled him &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot; for earning a firm second-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/11/clinton.nh/index.html |title=Clinton thanks New Hampshire for making him the 'Comeback Kid' |date=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=February 22, 2020 |publisher=CNN |first=Amy |last=Herstek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] on [[Super Tuesday]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.&lt;ref name=&quot;First in His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in [[Jerry Brown]]'s home state of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;First in His Class&quot; /&gt;

During the campaign, questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Ifill | first=Gwen | title=Hillary Clinton Defends Her Conduct in Law Firm | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/17/us/the-1992-campaign-hillary-clinton-defends-her-conduct-in-law-firm.html | date=March 17, 1992 | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents &quot;for the price of one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=MacGillis | first=Alec |last2=Kornblut |first2=Anne E. | title=Hillary Clinton Embraces Her Husband's Legacy | work=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/21/AR2007122102588.html | page=A1 | date=December 21, 2007 | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton was still the governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a possible political move to counter &quot;soft on crime&quot; accusations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mbsrgd&quot;&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-316-92919-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Applebome | first=Peter | title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/us/1992-campaign-death-penalty-arkansas-execution-raises-questions-governor-s.html | work=The New York Times | date=January 25, 1992 | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's [[United States presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] were around 80&amp;nbsp;percent during the [[Gulf War]], and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promise not to raise taxes]], which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=How the Presidents Stack Up: A look at U.S. presidents' job-approval ratings | work=The Wall Street Journal | year=2006 | url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html | accessdate=October 30, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025015927/http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html| archivedate= October 25, 2008 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue.

Clinton was [[First inauguration of Bill Clinton|inaugurated]] as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00011 | title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress—1st Session | publisher=United States Senate | accessdate= August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |title=New Nationwide Poll Shows Strong Support for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) |publisher=Protect Family Leave |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227065806/http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international [[family planning]] programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon L. Camp, ''The Politics of U.S. Population Assistance'', in ''Beyond the Numbers: A Reader on Population, Consumption and the Environment'' (ed. Laurie Ann Mazur), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said abortion should be kept &quot;safe, legal, and rare&quot;—a slogan that had been suggested by [[University of California, San Diego]] political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin]] and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Sullivan, ''The Party Faithful: How and Why Democrats Are Closing the God Gap'' (Simon &amp; Schuster: 2008), pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, ''The Party Faithful'', pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a [[budget deficit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/us/white-house-hones-all-out-campaign-to-sell-sacrifice.html | title=White House Hones All-Out Campaign to Sell Sacrifice | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 15, 1993 | author=Richard L. Burke | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a [[joint session of Congress]], Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/cron | title=The Clinton Years: Chronology | work=[[Frontline (American TV program)|Frontline]] | accessdate=June 13, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502012813/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/cron/| archivedate=May 2, 2010 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Woodward | first=Bob | author-link=Bob Woodward | title=Maestro | url=https://archive.org/details/maestrogreenspan00wood | url-access=registration | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=New York | year=2000 | page=[https://archive.org/details/maestrogreenspan00wood/page/116 116]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the [[White House travel office controversy]] even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be [[At-will employment|dismissed without cause]]. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hillary | last=Clinton | authorlink=Hillary Clinton | title=Living History | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-7432-2224-5 | page=172| title-link=Living History (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ken | last=Gormley | authorlink=Ken Gormley (academic) | title=The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr | publisher=[[Crown Publishers]] | location=New York | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-307-40944-7 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/deathofamericanv00gorm/page/70 70–71] | url=https://archive.org/details/deathofamericanv00gorm/page/70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15{{nbsp}}million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90&amp;nbsp;percent of small businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/080393-presidential-press-conference-in-nevada.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927022455/http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/080393-presidential-press-conference-in-nevada.htm | archivedate=September 27, 2007 | title=Presidential Press Conference in Nevada | date=August 3, 1993 | first=Bill | last=Clinton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2&amp;nbsp;percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/219941 | title=William J.

On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]]; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer [[John F. Harris]] said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by [[George J. Mitchell]] failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

In November 1993, [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]]—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the [[Whitewater controversy]]—alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon031798&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jonathan | last1=Broder |author2-link=Murray Waas |first2=Murray | last2=Waas | url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html | title=The Road To Hale | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | date=March 17, 1998 | accessdate=August 25, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616194202/http://salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html | archivedate=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.

On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], which mandated federal [[background check]]s on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|NICS system]] was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low-income workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in ''[[The American Spectator]].'' In the affair later known as &quot;[[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]]&quot;, the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]]. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated &quot;bad journalism&quot;, and that &quot;the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;apology&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse | title=Reporter Apologizes For Clinton Sex Article | publisher=CNN | date=March 10, 1998 | first=Jonathan | last=Karl | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614124146/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/| archivedate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as &quot;[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]&quot;, which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feder |first1=Jody | title=&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;: A Legal Analysis | publisher=DIANE Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4379-2208-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including senators [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA). According to [[David Mixner]], Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that &quot;the President should lift the ban&amp;nbsp;... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mixner2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Mixner | first=David | title=Stranger Among Friends | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Jeg2X025UgC| date=November 25, 2009 | publisher=Random House Publishing Group | isbn=978-0-307-42958-2 | pages=495–497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stranger Among Friends—book reviews |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 |newspaper=[[Washington Monthly]] |first=John | last=Cloud |date=November 1996 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826114431/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826/ |archivedate=August 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President [[Harry S.

Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not &quot;out of whack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html | title=President seeks better implementation of 'don't ask, don't tell' | date=December 11, 1999 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy remained controversial, and was finally [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|repealed in 2011]], removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Obama certifies end of military's gay ban | agency=[[Reuters]] | publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=July 22, 2011 | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43859711 | accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] into law.&lt;ref name=NAFTA&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Don C. Livingston |author2=Kenneth A. Wink | title=The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck? | journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly | volume=27 | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of [[Ross Perot]]. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.&lt;ref name=NAFTA /&gt;

On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-104publ199 | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | title=PUBLIC LAW 104–199—DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Yandura]], speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA &quot;was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election&quot;.

In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators [[Ted Kennedy]]—a Democrat—and [[Orrin Hatch]]—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] by the Republican Congress.

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a [[grand jury]] that had been convened to investigate [[perjury]] he may have committed in his sworn deposition during ''[[Clinton v. Jones|Jones v. Clinton]],'' [[Paula Jones]]'s sexual harassment lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm | title=Case Closed | first=Dan | last=Froomkin | work=The Washington Post | date=August 26, 1999 | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.

Clinton [[Bill Clinton pardon controversy|controversially issued]] 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010120/aponline135239_000.htm | title=Clinton Pardon's List | agency=[[Associated Press]] | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 20, 2001 | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the controversy surrounded [[Marc Rich]] and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, [[Hugh Edwin Rodham|Hugh Rodham]], accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Clinton pardons: Cast of characters | publisher=BBC News | date=February 22, 2001 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1184118.stm | accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal prosecutor [[Mary Jo White]] was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich.

===Military and foreign affairs===

{{Further|Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration}}
[[File:President Clinton talks with Col. Paul Fletcher, USAF.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Paul J. Fletcher|Paul Fletcher]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and Clinton speak before boarding [[Air Force One]], November 4, 1999.]]

During his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions.

====Somalia====

The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, [[MH-60 Black Hawk|two U.S. helicopters]] were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The people killed them. Chopped them up. I consider myself lucky |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1993/oct/09/usa |work=The Guardian |date=October 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.

====Rwanda====

In April 1994, [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] broke out in [[Rwanda]]. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a &quot;final solution to eliminate all Tutsis&quot; was planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrol|first=Rory|title=US chose to ignore Rwandan genocide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda|publisher=theguardian|location=London|date=1 April 2004|access-date=13 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228191139/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambush in Mogadishu: Transcript |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/script.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506142008/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/script.html |archive-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying &quot;I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chozick|first=Amy|title=In Africa, Bill Clinton Toils for a Charitable Legacy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/in-africa-bill-clinton-works-to-leave-a-charitable-legacy.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022022004/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/in-africa-bill-clinton-works-to-leave-a-charitable-legacy.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=22 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====

In 1995, U.S. and [[NATO]] aircraft [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|bombed Bosnian Serb targets]] to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the [[Bosnian war]]. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent [[Dayton Agreement]].

====Irish peace talks====

In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to [[Northern Ireland]], but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the [[UK]] government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of [[Belfast]] and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during [[the Troubles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/30/newsid_4459000/4459860.stm|title=1995: Clinton kindles hope in Northern Ireland|date=1995-11-30|access-date=2019-12-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, [[Dublin]], the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace talks]], which eventually led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1065913.stm|title=Clinton: His role in Northern Ireland|date=2000-12-11|access-date=2019-12-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====

In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8{{nbsp}}million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|131.8|1996|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the [[International Court of Justice]] after the shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by the U.S. Navy [[guided missile cruiser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/07/the-vincennes-downing-of-iran-air-flight-655-the-united-states-tried-to-cover-up-its-own-destruction-of-a-passenger-plane.html | title=America's Flight 17 | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Osama bin Laden====

Capturing [[Osama bin Laden]] had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until [[Death of Osama bin Laden|bin Laden's death in 2011]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html | title=Bill Clinton: I got closer to killing bin Laden | publisher=CNN | date=September 24, 2006 | accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims by [[Mansoor Ijaz]] and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-05-oe-ijaz05-story.html | title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize | work=Los Angeles Times | date=December 5, 2001 | accessdate=February 22, 2020 | first=Mansoor | last=Ijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[9/11 Commission Report]] stated that &quot;we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_5.pdf | title=Staff Statement No. 5 | publisher=9/11 Commission | accessdate=February 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1998, Clinton [[Operation Infinite Reach|ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan]], targeting the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]] in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=John | last=Pike | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bgm-109-operation.htm | title=BGM-109 Tomahawk—Smart Weapons | publisher=Globalsecurity.org | accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Clinton's [[1998 State of the Union Address]], he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:{{quote|Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.

Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, &quot;You cannot defy the will of the world&quot;, and when I say to him, &quot;You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Text of President Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address | date=January 27, 1998 | first=Bill | last=Clinton | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou98.htm | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act of 1998]] into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of &quot;regime change&quot; against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218092435/http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm | archivedate=February 18, 2007 | title=Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session | publisher=Library of Congress | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4655/text/enr | title=H.R.4655—Iraq Liberation Act of 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named [[Operation Desert Fox]], lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998.

After initial successes such as the [[Oslo Accords]] of the early 1990s, which also led to the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] in 1994 and the [[Wye River Memorandum]] in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

Clinton also experienced a number of [[Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]], as 69 nominees to [[United States federal judge|federal judgeships]] did not receive a vote in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-controlled [[Senate Judiciary Committee]].

Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.&lt;ref name=&quot;hallmark1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abuse-allegations-have-revived-scrutiny-of-bill-clinton--and-divided-democrats/2017/11/17/3d1711c8-cba4-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html|title=Abuse allegations have revived scrutiny of Bill Clinton—and divided Democrats|first1=Karen|last1=Tumulty|first2=Katie|last2=Mettler|date=November 17, 2017|access-date=November 19, 2017|work=The Washington Post|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119050428/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abuse-allegations-have-revived-scrutiny-of-bill-clinton--and-divided-democrats/2017/11/17/3d1711c8-cba4-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html|archivedate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mccoy1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729|title=Bill Clinton: A Reckoning|first=Caitlin|last=Flanagan|website=The Atlantic|access-date=November 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118231945/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729/|archivedate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/17/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-bill-clinton-democrats/index.html|title=Should Democrats turn their backs on Bill Clinton?|first=Z.
