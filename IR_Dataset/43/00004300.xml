Developed into its present form in [[Italy]], bocce is played around [[Europe]] and also in other areas with [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrants]], including [[Australia]], [[North America]], and [[South America]]. Initially played only by the Italian immigrants, the game has slowly become more popular with their descendants and more broadly.

==History==
Bocce is closely related to British bowls and French ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'', all having developed from games played in the Roman Empire. It was developed into its present form in Italy&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=razzett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=razzett&amp;f=false Malta and Gozo].&lt;/ref&gt; (where it is called ''{{lang|it|bocce}}'', the plural of the Italian word ''{{lang|it|boccia}}'' which means 'bowl' in the sport sense),&lt;ref name=&quot;collins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/boccia |title=boccia |work=Collins Italian–English |via=CollinsDictionary.com |access-date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is played around Europe and also in regions to which Italians have migrated, such as Australia, North America, and South America (where it is known as ''{{lang|es|bochas}}'', or ''{{lang|es|bolas criollas}}'' ('[[Criollo people|Criollo]] balls') in [[Venezuela]], ''{{lang|pt-BR|bocha}}'' in [[Brazil]]). The popularity of the game spread first amongst descendants of Italian migrants but has slowly spread into the wider community.

==Geographical spread==
The sport is also very popular on the eastern side of the [[Adriatic]], especially in [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], where the sport is known in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] as ''{{lang|sh|boćanje}}'' ('playing ''{{lang|sh|boće}}''&lt;nowiki /&gt;') or ''{{lang|sh|balote}}'' (colloquially also ''{{lang|hr|bućanje}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;hr&quot;&gt;[http://www.hrvatski-bocarski-savez.hr/ Croatian Bocce Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hr2&quot;&gt;[[Croatian Bocce Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bih&quot;&gt;[http://www.bocanje-bih.com/ BiH Bocce Association]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Slovenia]] the sport is known as ''{{lang|sl|balinanje}}''&lt;ref name=&quot;slo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://portal.balinarska-zveza.si/ |title=Bocce Association of Slovenia |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611221558/http://portal.balinarska-zveza.si/ |archive-date=11 June 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; or colloquially 'playing ''{{lang|sl|boče}}''&lt;nowiki /&gt;', or ''{{lang|sl|bale}}'' (from Italian ''{{lang|it|bocce}}'' and Venetian ''{{lang|vec|bałe}}'', meaning 'balls').&lt;ref name=&quot;slo2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.etno-muzej.si/en/spletne-zbirke/klasifikacije/igra-odraslih |title=Slovene Ethnographic Museum |access-date=13 March 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130622091515/http://www.etno-muzej.si/en/spletne-zbirke/klasifikacije/igra-odraslih |archive-date=22 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and play==
Bocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts {{convert|27.5|m}} in length and {{convert|2.5|to|4|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 4 - Specifications of the Court]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bocce balls can be made of wood (traditional), [[metal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 1 - The Bowls]&lt;/ref&gt;, baked clay, or various kinds of [[plastic]]. Unlike [[lawn bowls]], bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.   
A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the '''jack''' (called a ''{{lang|it|boccino}}'' ('little bocce') or ''{{lang|it|pallino}}'' ('bullet' or 'little ball') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone {{convert|5|m|ft}} in length, ending {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=razzett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=razzett&amp;f=false Malta and Gozo].&lt;/ref&gt;  Casual play is common in reasonably flat areas of parks and yards lacking a Bocce court, but players should agree to the minimum and maximum distance the jack may be thrown before play begins.

The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does ''not'' have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch2.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 2 - Article 8 - Points to be Made and the Duration of the Match]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=razzett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=razzett&amp;f=false Malta and Gozo].&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=razzett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=razzett&amp;f=false Malta and Gozo].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Bocce volo===
{{main|Bocce volo}}
A variation called ''{{lang|it|bocce volo}}'' uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game ''{{lang|fr|[[jeu provençal]]}}'' also known as ''{{lang|fr|boule lyonnaise}}''.  A French variant of the game is called ''{{lang|fr|[[pétanque]]}}'', and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional ''{{lang|it|bocce}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Petanque vs. Bocce at [http://petanque-america.com/game.html Petanque America]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boccia===
{{main|Boccia}}
[[File:Australian Boccia team members.jpg|thumb|Australian boccia team members]]
Another development, for persons with disabilities, is called ''{{lang|it|boccia}}''. It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface. Boccia was first introduced to the [[Paralympics]] at the [[1984 Summer Paralympics|1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Summer Games]], and is one of the only two Paralympic sports that do not have an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] counterpart (the other being [[goalball]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.paralympic.org/boccia|title=Boccia |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |work=Paralympic.org |access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
