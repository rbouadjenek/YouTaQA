      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of systems of '''transport in Burundi''', including road and water-based infrastructure, the latter of which makes use of [[Lake Tanganyika]].  Furthermore, there are also some airports in [[Burundi]].

A great hindrance to Burundi's economic development is lack of adequate transportation. The country has limited ferry services on Lake Tanganyika, few road connections to neighboring countries, no rail connections, and only one airport with a paved runway. Public transport is extremely limited and private bus companies operate buses on the route to Kigali but not to Tanzania or the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Planet, Buses in Burundi, http://www.bus-planet.com/bus/bus-africa/Burundi-site/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roads ==
Roads total {{convert|12322|km}} as of 2004, and only about 7 percent of them are paved and remain open in all weather; the rest are classed as local roads or tracks. In 2003, there were 24,000 passenger cars and 23,500 commercial vehicles. On paper there are 90 public buses in the country but few of these are operational. Transport is extremely limited and private bus companies operate buses on the route to Kigali but not to Tanzania or the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Bus Planet, Buses in Burundi, http://www.bus-planet.com/bus/bus-africa/Burundi-site/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waterways ==
[[Lake Tanganyika]] is used for transport, with the major [[port]] on the lake being [[Bujumbura]]. Most &lt;!-- money --&gt; freight is transported down waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mugumyankiko|first1=Emmanuel|title=The critical importance of access to the sea to the development of Burundi|url=http://commons.wmu.se/gma_disserations/1|website=General Maritime Administration Dissertations|publisher=General Maritime Administration Dissertations|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2015, [[MV Mwongozo]], a passenger and cargo ferry, connects [[Bujumbura]] with [[Kigoma]] in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;World Travel Guide, Travel to Burundi, http://www.worldtravelguide.net/burundi/travel-by&lt;/ref&gt;

== Airports and air services ==
[[File:Bujumbura International Airport.jpg|thumb|Arrival at Bujumbura International Airport]]
Burundi possesses eight [[airport]]s, of which one has paved [[runway]]s, whose length exceeds 3,047m. [[Bujumbura International Airport]] is the country's primary airport and the country's only airport with a paved runway. There are also a number of helicopter landing strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.traveldojo.com/burundi/#getting-there-away|title=Burundi Travel Guide|website=www.traveldojo.com|access-date=2018-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2015 the airlines serving Burundi are: [[Brussels Airlines]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]], [[flydubai]], [[Kenya Airways]] and [[RwandAir]]. [[Kigali International Airport|Kigali]] is the city with the most daily departures.

== Railways ==
Burundi does not possess any [[railway]] infrastructure, although there are proposals to connect Burundi to its neighbours via railway.

At a meeting in August 2006 with members of the [[Rwanda Patriotic Front]], [[Wu Guanzheng]], of the [[Communist Party of China]], confirmed the intention of the [[People's Republic of China]] to fund a study into the feasibility of constructing a railway connecting at [[Isaka]] with the existing [[Tanzania]]n railway network, and running via [[Kigali]] in [[Rwanda]] through to Burundi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China to Assist Rwanda|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2006/09/china-to-assist-rwanda/|work=[http://www.railwaysafrica.com Railways Africa website]|publisher=Railways Africa|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tanzanian railways use {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}}, although [[TAZARA]] and other neighbouring countries, including the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) use the {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} gauge, leading to some potential difficulties.

Another project was launched in the same year, which aims to link Burundi and Rwanda (which also has no railways) to the DRC and [[Zambia]], and therefore to the rest of Southern Africa. At a meeting to inaugurate the [[Northern Corridor Transit and Transport Coordination Authority]] (NCTTCA), the governments of Uganda and Burundi backed the proposed new railway from the Ugandan western [[railhead]] at [[Kasese]] into the DRC.

Additionally, Burundi has been added to a planned railway project to connect Tanzania and Rwanda.

=== 2013 ===
A project started in November 2013 to build a [[Standard Gauge]] line from [[Mombassa]], Kenya, to Burundi, via Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25134276 Kenya launches new railway to reach South Sudan and Burundi], BBC News, 28 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The main line from Mombasa will also feature branches in other directions, including Ethiopia and DR Congo.
