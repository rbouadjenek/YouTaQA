==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], Washington, on October 28, 1955. He is the son of [[William H. Gates Sr.]]{{efn|His father was named William H. Gates II, but he is now generally known as William H. Gates, Senior to avoid confusion with his son.}} (b. 1925) and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]] (1929–1994).

Gates' maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or &quot;Trey&quot; (i.e., three) because his father had the &quot;II&quot; suffix.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=15}}&lt;ref name=&quot;leibovich20001231&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/31/alter-egos/91b267b0-858c-4d4e-a4bd-48f22e015f70/ |title=Alter Egos |last=Leibovich |first=Mark |date=December 31, 2000 |work=Washington Post |access-date=June 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225224631/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/31/alter-egos/91b267b0-858c-4d4e-a4bd-48f22e015f70/ |archive-date=December 25, 2016 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in the [[Sand Point, Seattle|Sand Point]] area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lange |first1=Greg |last2=Stein |first2=Alan |date=February 14, 1999 |title=Tornado with 100-m.p.h. winds hits Seattle and Juanita on September 28, 1962. |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/886 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=47}} When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the [[Congregational Christian Churches]], a Protestant Reformed denomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congregational 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist | url = https://archive.org/details/billgatesentrepr0000lesi |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/billgatesentrepr0000lesi/page/12 12] | first =Jeanne M | last = Lesinski |publisher=Twenty First Century Books | accessdate =March 10, 2011|isbn= 9781580135702|date = September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Congregational 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates Speaks: Insight from the World's Greatest Entrepreneur|url = https://books.google.com/?id=LUwu-DTwa5cC&amp;pg=PA3 | first = Janet | last = Lowe| publisher = Wiley | accessdate=March 10, 2011|isbn= 9780471401698|date = January 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Congregational 3&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Something Happened: A Political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies | url =https://archive.org/details/somethinghappene00berk| url-access = registration | page = [https://archive.org/details/somethinghappene00berk/page/228 228] | author-link = Edward D.

At 13, he enrolled in the private [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside prep school]],{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=24}} and he wrote his first software program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates|title=Bill Gates {{!}} American computer programmer, businessman, and philanthropist|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=December 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the students.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=27}} Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.{{sfn|Gates|1996|p=12}} After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to [[Computer Center Corporation]] (CCC) which banned for the summer Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Gates' best friend and first business collaborator Kent Evans after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | agency = V3 | title = Paul Allen spills the beans on Gates' criminal past | place = UK | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130312212620/http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | archivedate = March 12, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|leibovich20001231}}

The four students had formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.{{r|leibovich20001231}} At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system remotely via [[Teleprinter|Teletype]], Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The two friends wrote the school's student information system software to schedule students in classes, and Gates modified the code so that he was placed in classes with &quot;a disproportionate number of interesting girls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leibovich20001231&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/speeches/2005/09/bill-gates-lakeside-school | title = Remarks by Bill Gates, co-chair | accessdate = July 13, 2013 | work = Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&amp;nbsp;– Press Room, Speeches | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703072235/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2005/09/Bill-Gates-Lakeside-School | archivedate = July 3, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life.

Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard,{{sfn|Gates|1996|p=19}} and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers.

Gates read the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' which demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], and he contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft |format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. MITS hired Allen,&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft history |publisher=The History of Computing Project |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211138/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership &quot;Micro-Soft&quot;, a combination of &quot;microcomputer&quot; and &quot;software&quot;, and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator [[Ric Weiland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot; /&gt; They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name &quot;Microsoft&quot; with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot; /&gt; Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

[[Microsoft]]'s Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair &quot;hobby market&quot; was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}} This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot; /&gt; The company moved from Albuquerque to [[Bellevue, Washington]] on January 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot; /&gt;

Gates said that he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. As the company grew he transitioned to a manager role, then an executive.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterloo&quot;&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |last=Gates |first=William 'Bill' |title=Remarks |date=October 13, 2005 |location=Waterloo, ON |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130809/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM partnership===
[[IBM]], the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]].{{r |bunnell1982febmar}} IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes|first1=John Steele|last1=Gordon|first2=Michael|last2=Maiello|authorlink1=John Steele Gordon|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=March 31, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029221703/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|archivedate=October 29, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using [[86-DOS]], an operating system similar to CP/M, that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patersontech.com/dos/microsoft-micronews.aspx |title=Father of DOS |work=Paterson Technology |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906120441/http://www.patersontech.com/dos/microsoft-micronews.aspx |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patersontech.com/dos/softalk.aspx |title=The Roots of DOS |work=Paterson Technology |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906120449/http://www.patersontech.com/dos/softalk.aspx |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and delivered it to IBM as [[PC DOS]] for a one-time fee of $50,000.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}}

Rather than the contract itself, which earned Microsoft a relatively small fee, the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system was the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the World's leading software company. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of [[MS-DOS]] (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}} The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. ''PC Magazine'' asked if Gates was &quot;the man behind the machine?&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunnell1982febmar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16 | title = The Man Behind The Machine? | type = interview | work = PC Magazine | date = Feb–Mar 1982 | accessdate = February 17, 2012 | last = Bunnell | first = David | page = 16 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130509162040/http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16 | archivedate = May 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;before microsoft&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Paul Allen|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/paul-allen-201105 |title=Microsoft's Odd Couple |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2011 |accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.&lt;ref name=&quot;leibovich20001231&quot;/&gt; They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates Mourns Allen&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://fortune.com/2018/10/16/bill-gates-paul-allen-death-microsoft/ |title=Bill Gates Mourns His Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen: 'Personal Computing Would Not Have Existed Without Him' |last=Detrick |first=Hallie |date=October 16, 2018 |work=Fortune |access-date=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows===
Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/0000/PX00738.pdf |title=Challenges and Strategy |work=Groklaw |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that &quot;Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;freiberger19810831&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA49 | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | last=Freiberger | first=Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | magazine=InfoWorld | page=49 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902132455/https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA49 | archivedate=September 2, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times.

Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative.

During Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100]],&lt;ref name=&quot;allison1993&quot;&gt;{{cite interview | last=Gates | first=Bill | subjectlink=Bill Gates | interviewer=David Allison | url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | title=Bill Gates Interview | work=Transcript of a Video History Interview / Computer History Collection | publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=April 10, 2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402195548/http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | archivedate=April 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdc97&quot; /&gt; [[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote in 1985 when Gates announced [[Microsoft Excel]]: &quot;Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat [[hack (programmer subculture)|hack]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pournelle198509&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n329/mode/2up | title=PCs, Peripherals, Programs, and People | work=BYTE | date=September 1985 | accessdate=March 20, 2016 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy.

===Antitrust litigation===

[[File:US v. Microsoft Bill Gates Color.png|thumb|Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Gates approved of many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 ''[[United States v.

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: &quot;...{{nbsp}}there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a [[pandemic]], or nuclear or [[bioterrorism]].&quot; Gates also identified innovation as the &quot;real driver of progress&quot; and pronounced that &quot;America's way better today than it's ever been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann S.

Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the &quot;William H.

Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] as a major influence.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gates stated in regard to his faith: &quot;The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;God&quot; /&gt;

Gates also said: &quot;I agree with people like [[Richard Dawkins]] that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm&amp;nbsp;– not all&amp;nbsp;– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;God&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Goodell|first=Jeff|date=March 27, 2014|magazine=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 14, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509035553/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|archivedate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
