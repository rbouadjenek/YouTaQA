&lt;!--... Attention:  THIS IS AN OUTLINE

        part of the set of 740+ outlines listed at
             [[Portal:Contents/Outlines]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to dance:

[[Dance]] &amp;ndash; human movement either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. A great many dances and dance styles are performed to [[dance music]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==What ''type'' of thing is dance?==
Dance (also called &quot;dancing&quot;) can fit the following categories:

* an activity or [[Human behavior|behavior]]
** one of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; a creative endeavor or discipline.
*** one of the [[performing arts]].
** [[Hobby]] &amp;ndash; regular activity or interest that is undertaken for pleasure, typically done during one's leisure time.
** [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] &amp;ndash; bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.
**[[Sport]]—bodily activity that displays physical exertion
**[[Recreation]] &amp;ndash; leisure time activity
**[[Ritual]]

Some other things can be named &quot;dance&quot; metaphorically; see [[dance (disambiguation)]]

== Types of dance ==

Type of dance &amp;ndash; a particular dance or dance style.  There are many varieties of dance.  Dance categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[tango (dance)|tango]] is traditionally a ''partner dance''. While it is mostly ''social dance'', its [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] form may be ''competitive dance'', as in [[DanceSport]]. At the same time it is enjoyed as ''performance dance'', whereby it may well be a ''solo dance''.

=== Dance styles by number of interacting dancers ===
* [[Solo dance]] &amp;ndash; a dance danced by an individual dancing alone.
* [[Partner dance]] &amp;ndash; dance with just 2 dancers, dancing together. In most partner dances, one, typically a man, is the leader; the other, typically a woman, is the follower. As a rule, they maintain connection with each other. In some dances the connection is loose and called dance handhold. In other dances the connection involves body contact.
** [[Glossary of partner dance terms]]
* [[Group dance]] &amp;ndash; dance danced by a group of people simultaneously. Group dances are generally, but not always, coordinated or standardized in such a way that all the individuals in the group are dancing the same steps at the same time. Alternatively, various groups within the larger group may be dancing different, but complementary, parts of the larger dance.
