      <text xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}
A '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.

==Group I: dsDNA viruses==
[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]
[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').

A virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.

[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order — [[Megavirales]] — for the  nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Colson2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colson2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = &quot;Megavirales&quot;, a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517–21 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]]. Four [[genus|genera]] are recognised that have not yet been assigned a family.

Fifteen families are [[viral envelope|enveloped]]. These include all three families in the order ''Herpesvirales'' and the following families: ''Ascoviridae'', ''Ampullaviridae'', ''Asfarviridae'', ''Baculoviridae'', ''Fuselloviridae'', ''Globuloviridae'', ''Guttaviridae'', ''Hytrosaviridae'', ''Iridoviridae'', ''Lipothrixviridae'', ''Nimaviridae'' and ''Poxviridae''.

[[Bacteriophage]]s (viruses infecting [[bacteria]]) belonging to the families ''Tectiviridae'' and ''Corticoviridae'' have a lipid bilayer [[membrane]] inside the icosahedral [[protein]] [[capsid]] and the membrane surrounds the genome. The crenarchaeal virus ''Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus'' has a similar structure.

The genomes in this group vary considerably from ~10 kilobases to over 2.5 megabases in length. The largest bacteriophage known is Klebsiella Phage vB_KleM-RaK2 which has a genome of 346 kilobases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simoliūnas2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simoliūnas E, Kaliniene L, Truncaitė L, Zajančkauskaitė A, Staniulis J, Kaupinis A, Ger M, Valius M, Meškys R | title = Klebsiella phage vB_KleM-RaK2—a giant singleton virus of the family Myoviridae | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = e60717 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23593293 | pmc = 3622015 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0060717 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...860717S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virophages are a group of viruses that infect other viruses.

A virus with a novel method of genome packing infecting species of the genus ''[[Sulfolobus]]'' has been described.&lt;ref name=Liu2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Ishino S, Ishino Y, Pehau-Arnaudet G, Krupovic M, Prangishvili D | title = A Novel Type of Polyhedral Viruses Infecting Hyperthermophilic Archaea | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 91 | issue = 13 | pages = e00589–17 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28424284 | pmc = 5469268 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00589-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As this virus does not resemble any known virus it has been classified into a new family, the ''[[Portogloboviridae]]''.

Another ''[[Sulfolobus]]'' infecting virus—Sulfolobus ellipsoid virus 1—has been described.&lt;ref name=Wang2017&gt;Wang H, Guo Z, Feng H, Chen Y, Chen X, Li Z, Hernández-Ascencio W, Dai X, Zhang Z, Zheng X, Mora-López M, Fu Y, Zhang C, Zhu P, Huang L (2017) A novel Sulfolobus virus with an exceptional capsid architecture. J Virol&lt;/ref&gt; This enveloped virus has a unique capsid and may be classified into a new taxon.

===Unclassified viruses===

A group of double stranded DNA viruses have been found in fish that appear to be related to the herpesviruses.&lt;ref name=Aswad2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aswad A, Katzourakis A | title = A novel viral lineage distantly related to herpesviruses discovered within fish genome sequence data | journal = Virus Evolution | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = vex016 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28798873 | pmc = 5544889 | doi = 10.1093/ve/vex016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pleolipoviruses==

==Group II: ssDNA viruses==
[[File:Genome map of the bacteriophage ΦX174 showing overlapping genes.svg|thumb|300px|Genome of bacteriophage ΦX174,  a single-stranded DNA virus]]

Although [[bacteriophage]]s were first described in 1927, it was only in 1959 that Sinshemer working with phage [[Phi X 174]] showed that they could possess single-stranded DNA genomes.&lt;ref name=Sinshemer1959a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinshemer1959b/&gt; Despite this discovery, until relatively recently it was believed that most DNA viruses contained [[double-stranded DNA]]. Recent work, however, has shown that single-stranded DNA viruses can be highly abundant in [[seawater]], [[freshwater]], [[sediment]]s, terrestrial and extreme environments, as well as [[metazoa]]n-associated and marine [[microbial mat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labonte 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Labonté JM, Suttle CA | title = Previously unknown and highly divergent ssDNA viruses populate the oceans | journal = The ISME Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 2169–77 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23842650 | pmc = 3806263 | doi = 10.1038/ismej.2013.110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Desnues2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Angly/&gt; Many of these &quot;environmental&quot; viruses belong to the family ''[[Microviridae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roux S, Krupovic M, Poulet A, Debroas D, Enault F | title = Evolution and diversity of the Microviridae viral family through a collection of 81 new complete genomes assembled from virome reads | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e40418 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22808158 | pmc = 3394797 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0040418 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...740418R }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority has yet to be classified and assigned to genera and higher taxa. Because most of these viruses do not appear to be related, or are only distantly related to known viruses, additional taxa will have to be created to accommodate them.

;Archaea

Although ~50 archaeal viruses are known, all but two have double stranded genomes. These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''

===Taxonomy===

Families in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Eleven families are currently recognised.

* Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Bacilladnavirus|Bacilladnaviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Bidnaviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Genomoviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Microviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Smacoviridae]]''
* Family ''[[Spiraviridae]]''

===Classification===
A division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Rosario2009/&gt; This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.

Type I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.

Type II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.

Type III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.

Type IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.

Given the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme—if it is accepted by the ICTV—will need to be extended.

====CRESS DNA viruses====

All known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses also form icosahedral capsids. With the exception of the family ''Bidnaviridae'' and ''Anelloviridae'', all eukaryotic ssDNA viruses encode homologous rolling-circle replication initiation proteins with characteristic N-terminal endonuclease domains and C-terminal superfamily three helicase domains.&lt;ref name=Krupovic2013&gt;Krupovic M (2013) Networks of evolutionary interactions underlying the polyphyletic origin of ssDNA viruses. Current Opinion in Virology 3: 578–586&lt;/ref&gt; A name for this group of viruses has been proposed—circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink3=Mya Breitbart | vauthors = Rosario K, Duffy S, Breitbart M | title = A field guide to eukaryotic circular single-stranded DNA viruses: insights gained from metagenomics | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 157 | issue = 10 | pages = 1851–71 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22760663 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-012-1391-y | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8eba9d5af73302e49f0f1d873737c4d208a9f1f5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that CRESS-DNA viruses have evolved from bacterial plasmids, from which they inherited the Rep genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kazlauskas |first1=Darius |last2=Varsani |first2=Arvind |last3=Koonin |first3=Eugene V. |last4=Krupovic |first4=Mart |title=Multiple origins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic single-stranded DNA viruses from bacterial&amp;nbsp;and archaeal plasmids |journal=Nature Communications |date=2019 |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=3425 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-11433-0 |pmid=31366885 |pmc=6668415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciviridae====

A group of ssDNA viruses whose Rep proteins show homology to ssDNA viruses from the families Geminiviridae, Circoviridae, and Nanoviridae, while their coat protein is related to those of ssRNA viruses from the family Tombusviridae and unclassified oomycete-infecting viruses.&lt;ref name=Diemer2012/&gt; The name Cruciviridae has been proposed for this group.&lt;ref name=Quaiser2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quaiser A, Krupovic M, Dufresne A, Francez AJ, Roux S | title = Sphagnum-dominated peatlands | journal = Virus Evolution | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = vew025 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 29492276 | pmc = 5822885 | doi = 10.1093/ve/vew025 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host range===
The families ''Bidnaviridae'' and ''Parvoviridae'' have linear genomes while the other families have circular genomes. The ''Bidnaviridae'' have a two part genome and infect invertebrates. The ''Inoviridae'' and ''Microviridae'' infect [[bacteria]]; the ''Anelloviridae'' and ''Circoviridae'' infect [[animal]]s ([[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s respectively); and the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' infect [[plant]]s. In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.

===Molecular biology===
All viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form—a double stranded DNA intermediate—for genome replication. This is normally created from the viral DNA with the assistance of the host's own [[DNA polymerase]].

===Recently classified viruses===

In the 9th edition of the viral taxonomy of the ICTV (published 2011) the Bombyx mori densovirus type 2 was placed in a new family—the ''[[Bidnaviridae]]'' on the basis of its genome structure and replication mechanism. This is currently the only member of this family but it seems likely that other species will be allocated to this family in the near future.

A new genus — [[Bufavirus]] — was proposed on the basis of the isolation of two new viruses from human stool.&lt;ref name=Phan2012/&gt; Another member of this genus—megabat bufavius 1—has been reported from bats.&lt;ref name=Sasaki2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasaki M, Gonzalez G, Wada Y, Setiyono A, Handharyani E, Rahmadani I, Taha S, Adiani S, Latief M, Kholilullah ZA, Subangkit M, Kobayashi S, Nakamura I, Kimura T, Orba Y, Ito K, Sawa H | title = Divergent bufavirus harboured in megabats represents a new lineage of parvoviruses | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 24257 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27113297 | pmc = 4845017 | doi = 10.1038/srep24257 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...624257S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human viruses have since been renamed [[Primate protoparvovirus]] and been placed in the genus [[Protoparvovirus]].&lt;ref name=ICTV&gt;{{cite web|title=ICTV Official Taxonomy: Updates since the 8th Report|url=http://talk.ictvonline.org/files/ictv_official_taxonomy_updates_since_the_8th_report/m/vertebrate-official/4844.aspx|website=ICTV Official Taxonomy|publisher=ICTV Official Taxonomy|access-date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotmore SF, Agbandje-McKenna M, Chiorini JA, Mukha DV, Pintel DJ, Qiu J, Soderlund-Venermo M, Tattersall P, Tijssen P, Gatherer D, Davison AJ | title = The family Parvoviridae | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 159 | issue = 5 | pages = 1239–47 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24212889 | pmc = 4013247 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1914-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed genus is [[Pecovirus]]. These are similar in organisation to the Smacovirus but share little sequence similarity.

====Animal viruses — invertebrates====
Among these are the parvovirus-like viruses. These have linear single-stranded DNA genomes but unlike the parvoviruses the genome is bipartate. This group includes [[Hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus]] and [[Lymphoidal parvo-like virus]]. A new family [[Bidensoviridae]] has been proposed for this group but this proposal has not been ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]] to date.&lt;ref name=Tijssen1995/&gt; Their closest relations appear to be the ''[[Brevidensoviruses]]'' (family Parvoviridae).&lt;ref name=Sukhumsirichart2006/&gt;

A virus has been isolated from the mud flat snail (''[[Amphibola crenata]]'').&lt;ref name=Dayaram2013/&gt; This virus has a single stranded circular genome of 2351 nucleotides that encodes 2 open reading frames that are oriented in opposite directions. The smaller open reading frame (874 nucleotides) encodes a protein with similarities to the ''Rep'' (replication) proteins of circoviruses and [[plasmid]]s. The larger open reading frame (955 nucleotides) has no homology to any currently known protein.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An unusual — and as yet unnamed — virus has been isolated from the flatworm ''[[Girardia tigrina]]''.&lt;ref name=Rebrikov2002/&gt; Because of its genome organisation, this virus appears to belong to an entirely new family. It is the first virus to be isolated from a [[flatworm]].

==Satellite viruses==
[[Satellite virus]]es are small viruses with either RNA or DNA as their genomic material that require another virus to replicate. There are two types of DNA satellite viruses—the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s—both of which are dependent on [[begomovirus]]es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.

Alphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.

==Phylogenetic relationships==
===Introduction===

Phylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins—DNA polymerase and others—or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.

===ds DNA viruses===
====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====
While determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.

While the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.&lt;ref name=McGeoch2006/&gt; On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages—specifically the Caudoviruses.

The branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davison2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–69 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.

The vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].&lt;ref name=Grose2012/&gt; The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.&lt;ref name=McGeoch1995/&gt; The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.&lt;ref name=McGeoch1994/&gt; The mammalian species divided into two branches—the  Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.

Several dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.&lt;ref name=Davison2002/&gt; Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.&lt;ref name=Koonin2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–24 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.&lt;ref name=Baker2005/&gt; These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex. A second paper has suggested an evolutionary relationship between these two groups of viruses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koonin2015&quot;/&gt;

Examination of the ''pol'' genes that encode the DNA dependent [[DNA polymerase]] in various groups of viruses suggests a number of possible evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name=Knopf1998/&gt; All know viral DNA polymerases belong to the DNA ''pol'' families A and B. All possess a 3'-5'-[[exonuclease]] domain with three sequence motifs Exo I, Exo II and Exo III.

The putative sequence motifs A, B, and C of the polymerase domain are located near the C-terminus in family A Pol and more central in family B Pol.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Phylogenetic analysis of these genes places the adenoviruses (''Adenoviridae''), bacteriophages (''Caudovirales'') and the plant and fungal linear plasmids into a single clade. A second clade includes the  alpha- and delta-like viral Pol from insect ascovirus (''Ascoviridae''), mammalian herpesviruses (''Herpesviridae''), fish lymphocystis disease virus (''Iridoviridae'') and chlorella virus (''Phycoviridae''). The ''pol'' genes of the African swine fever virus (''Asfarviridae''), baculoviruses (''Baculoviridae''), fish herpesvirus (''Herpesviridae''), [[T-even bacteriophages]] (''Myoviridae'') and poxviruses (''Poxviridae'') were not clearly resolved.

==Bacteriophage evolution==
Since 1959 ~6300 prokaryote viruses have been described morphologically, including ~6200 bacterial and ~100 archaeal viruses.&lt;ref name=Ackermann2012/&gt; Archaeal viruses belong to 15 families and infect members of 16 archaeal genera. These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and γ-[[proteobacteria]].

The vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (&gt;3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.&lt;ref name=Ackermann2003/&gt; They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.

All of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.

A putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.&lt;ref name=Ackermann1998/&gt;

Tailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.

The virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.

New phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.

Subsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]–[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.

A possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.&lt;ref name=Erdmann2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an Antarctic haloarchaeon uses specialized membrane vesicles to disseminate and infect plasmid-free cells | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 1446–1455 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28827601 | doi = 10.1038/s41564-017-0009-2 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0511bb8e14484be808603f643c7e20e9e63d54cb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCLDVs==
{{main|Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses}}
The asfarviruses, iridoviruses, mimiviruses, phycodnaviruses and poxviruses have been shown to belong to a single group,&lt;ref name=&quot;Iyer2006&quot;/&gt;—the large nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA viruses. These are also abbreviated &quot;NCLDV&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20017929&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yutin N, Wolf YI, Raoult D, Koonin EV | title = Eukaryotic large nucleo-cytoplasmic DNA viruses: clusters of orthologous genes and reconstruction of viral genome evolution | journal = Virology Journal | volume = 6 | pages = 223 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20017929 | pmc = 2806869 | doi = 10.1186/1743-422X-6-223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clade can be divided into two groups:

* the iridoviruses-phycodnaviruses-mimiviruses group. The phycodnaviruses and mimiviruses are sister clades.
* the poxvirus-asfarviruses group.

It is probable that these viruses evolved before the separation of eukaryoyes into the extant crown groups. The ancestral genome was complex with at least 41 genes including (1) the replication machinery (2) up to four [[RNA polymerase]] subunits (3) at least three [[transcription factor]]s (4) capping and polyadenylation enzymes (5) the DNA packaging apparatus (6) and structural components of an icosahedral capsid and the viral membrane.

The evolution of this group of viruses appears to be complex with genes having been gained from multiple sources.&lt;ref name=Yutin2012/&gt; It has been proposed that the ancestor of NCLDVs has evolved from large, virus-like DNA transposons of the Polinton/Maverick family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krupovic M, Koonin EV | title = Polintons: a hotbed of eukaryotic virus, transposon and plasmid evolution | journal = Nature Reviews.

Another group of large viruses—the [[Pandoraviridae]]—has been described. Two species—[[Pandoravirus salinus]] and [[Pandoravirus dulcis]]—have been recognized. These were isolated from [[Chile]] and [[Australia]] respectively. These viruses are about one [[micrometre|micrometer]] in diameter making them one of the largest viruses discovered so far. Their gene complement is larger than any other known virus to date. At present they appear to be unrelated to any other species of virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennisi E | title = Microbiology.
