The '''Annapolis Valley''' is a valley and region in the Canadian province of [[Nova Scotia]]. It is located in the western part of the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]], formed by a trough between two parallel mountain ranges along the shore of the [[Bay of Fundy]]. [[Statistics Canada]] defines the Annapolis Valley as an economic region, composed of [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis County]], [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings County]], and [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]].

==Geography==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
[[Image:Annapolis Valley from lookoff1.JPG|200px|thumb|left|View of the Annapolis Valley as viewed from [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] looking southeast from Valleyview Provincial Park, north of [[Bridgetown, Nova Scotia|Bridgetown]], in October 2005.]]
The valley measures approximately {{convert|126|km|mi}} in length from [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] and the [[Annapolis Basin]] in the west to [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]] and the [[Minas Basin]] in the east, spanning the counties of [[Digby County, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis]] and [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings]].

Some also include the western part of [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]], including the towns of [[Hantsport, Nova Scotia|Hantsport]] and [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] even further to the east, but geographically speaking they are part of the [[Avon River (Nova Scotia)|Avon River]] valley.

The steep face of basaltic [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] shelters the valley from the adjacent Bay of Fundy and rises over {{convert|260|m|ft}} in elevation near [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101617/http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The granitic [[South Mountain (Nova Scotia)|South Mountain]] rises to a somewhat higher elevation and shelters the valley from the climate of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 100 kilometres further south on the province's [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]].

The shelter provided by these two mountainous ridges has produced a &quot;micro climate&quot; which provides relatively mild temperatures for the region and, coupled with the fertile glacial sedimentary soils on the valley floor, the region is conducive to growing vegetable and fruit crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novascotia.com/eat-drink/eating-local|title=Nova Scotia Local Produce {{!}} Seafood {{!}} Lobster {{!}} Farmers' Markets {{!}} Locavore|work=Tourism Nova Scotia|access-date=3 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly famous for its apple crop, the valley hosts in excess of 1,000 farms of various types, the majority being relatively small family-owned operations.

Within the valley itself are two &quot;major&quot; rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] which flows west from the Caribou Bog in the central part of the valley into the [[Annapolis Basin]], and the [[Cornwallis River]] which flows east from Caribou Bog into the [[Minas Basin]]. The [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] ridge forms the north side of the Annapolis Valley. Also flowing east, in two smaller valleys north of the Cornwallis River, are the Canard River and the Habitant River, both of which also flow into the Minas Basin.

==History==
[[File:W&amp;ARGabriel.jpg|200px|left|thumb|One of the [[Windsor and Annapolis Railway]] locomotives which transformed the valley's apple industry]]
Long settled by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] Nation, the valley experienced French settlement at the [[Habitation at Port-Royal]], near modern-day Annapolis Royal in the western part of the valley, beginning in 1605. From there, the Acadians spread throughout the Valley, in various communities, building dykes to claim the tidal lands along the Annapolis and Cornwallis Rivers. They continued throughout the Annapolis Valley until the British-ordered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expulsion]] of [[Acadian]]s in 1755 which is memorialized at [[Grand Pre, Nova Scotia|Grand Pré]] in the eastern part of the valley.  [[New England Planters]] moved in to occupy the abandoned Acadian farming areas and the region also saw subsequent settlement by [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalist]] refugees of the [[American Revolutionary War]], as well as foreign Protestants. These were followed by significant numbers of freed Africans in the [[War of 1812]], Irish immigrants in the mid-19th century and Dutch immigrants after [[World War II]]. Agriculture in the Annapolis valley boomed in the late 19th century with the arrival of the [[Windsor and Annapolis Railway]], later the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], which developed large export markets for Annapolis Valley apples.

The [[Annapolis Valley Regional Library]] was established in 1949. It was the first regional library system in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the Library : Annapolis Valley Regional Library|url = http://www.valleylibrary.ca/about-library|website = valleylibrary.ca|accessdate = 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

[[File:Grafton, Nova Scotia.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Corn growing at [[Grafton, Nova Scotia|Grafton]] in the Annapolis Valley in October 2011]]
The Valley has traditionally been built on a diversified agricultural industry, with a wide range of output ranging from livestock to fruit trees and berries. The last quarter century has also seen the development of a wine industry, with such notable wineries as [[Gaspereau Vineyards]] winning national and international awards for their produce.

Today, the Valley is still largely dominated by agriculture but also has a growing diversity in its economies, partly aided by the importance of post-secondary education centres provided by [[Acadia University]] in Wolfville, and the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] campuses located in [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]], [[Middleton, Nova Scotia|Middleton]], [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]], and [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]].

[[Michelin]] has an important truck tire manufacturing plant in [[Waterville, Nova Scotia|Waterville]] and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] has its largest [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]] base in [[Atlantic Canada]] located at [[CFB Greenwood]] along with an important training facility at [[Land Force Atlantic Area Training Centre Aldershot|Camp Aldershot]], near Kentville.

Tourism is also an important industry and the Annapolis Valley is known for its scenic farmland, although today some is threatened with suburban development in the eastern end, and a great deal has been abandoned. The valley also struggles with pollution from farm runoffs and residential sewers in its two major rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] and the [[Cornwallis River]]. The Annapolis Valley additionally has become home to the majority of Nova Scotia wineries, located in either the Gaspereau Valley or in the Canning, Grand Pré, or Bear River areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://winesofnovascotia.ca/ |title = The Wineries of Nova Scotia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valley is home to the annual [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival|Apple Blossom Festival]], held in late spring. In July is the annual Steer Bar-B-Que in Kingston, and Heart of the Valley Festival in Middleton. August sees Mud Creek Days in Wolfville and the Annapolis Valley Exhibition in Lawrencetown. Bridgetown's Cider Festival comes in mid-September. The Canadian Deep Roots Music Festival is held each year at the end of September in Wolfville, a community-based festival, supported by both The Town of Wolfville and Acadia University and built on countless hours of volunteerism by a stable base of over 100 volunteers, and on in-kind and financial support from virtually all sectors of the Valley community. Late October sees Wolfville and Kings County play host to [[Devour! The Food Film Fest|Devour The Food Film Fest]], an annual international film festival celebrating all things culinary. Farmers markets in Annapolis Royal, Bridgetown, Middleton, Kentville, Kingsport, Berwick and Wolfville bring a wealth of fresh produce and other fine goods to the public every week. In the fall the Pumpkin People in Kentville entice the imagination.
