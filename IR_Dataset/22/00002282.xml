'''Alexis Andrew Nicholas Koerner''' (19 April 1928 – 1 January 1984), known professionally as '''Alexis Korner''', was a British [[blues]] musician and radio broadcaster, who has sometimes been referred to as &quot;a founding father of [[British blues]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|iDE0dH6ZLwUC|Then, now and rare British beat 1960–1969 by Terry Rawlings|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major influence on the sound of the British music scene in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=&quot;ibndjr&quot;/&gt; Korner was instrumental in the formation of several notable British bands including [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Free (band)|Free]].

==Early career==
Korner was born in [[Paris]], France,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=723}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an Austrian Jewish father and a Greek mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=iTunes|title=Alexis Korner Biography|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/alexis-korner/id3194103|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Fricke's Picks: Free, Bluesman Alexis Korner, &quot;Scandinavia Action Jazz&quot;|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/frickes-picks-free-bluesman-alexis-korner-scandinavia-action-jazz-20061117|accessdate=3 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122212120/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/frickes-picks-free-bluesman-alexis-korner-scandinavia-action-jazz-20061117|archive-date=22 January 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood in France, Switzerland and North Africa and arrived in London in 1940 at the start of World War II. One memory of his youth was listening to a record by black pianist [[Jimmy Yancey]] during a German [[Strategic bombing|air raid]]. Korner said, &quot;From then on all I wanted to do was play the blues.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tsxbpf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alexis-korner-mn0000001020/biography |title=Alexis Korner &amp;#124; Biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Korner played piano and guitar (his first guitar was built by friend and author Sydney Hopkins, who wrote ''[[Mister God, This Is Anna]]'') and in 1949 joined [[Chris Barber]]'s Jazz Band&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/chris-barber-father-of-british-rb/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128073947/http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/chris-barber-father-of-british-rb/|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he met blues harmonica player [[Cyril Davies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; They started playing together as a duo, started the influential [[London Blues and Barrelhouse Club]] in 1955 and made their first record together in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Korner made his first official record on [[Decca Records]] DFE 6286 in the company of [[Ken Colyer]]'s [[Skiffle]] Group. His talent extended to playing [[mandolin]] on one of the tracks of this rare British [[Extended play|EP]], recorded in London on 28 July 1955. Korner encouraged many American blues artists, previously virtually unknown in Britain, to perform at the London Blues and Barrelhouse Club, which he established with Davies at the Round House pub in [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|4y-oDmH2YzYC|The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by Allan F. Moore|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1960s==
{{Main|Blues Incorporated}}
In 1961, Korner and Davies formed [[Blues Incorporated]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/blues-incorporated-how-british-rb-trashed-trad]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728141506/http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/blues-incorporated-how-british-rb-trashed-trad|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially a loose-knit group of musicians with a shared love of [[electric blues]] and [[R&amp;B]] music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; The group included, at various times, [[Charlie Watts]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Long John Baldry]], [[Graham Bond]], [[Danny Thompson]] and [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; It also attracted a wider crowd of mostly younger fans, some of whom occasionally performed with the group, including [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Mayall]] and [[Jimmy Page]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro1997&gt;{{cite book|last = Shapiro |first = Harry  |title = Alexis Korner: The Biography |year =1997|isbn = 0-7475-3163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Cyril Davies left the group in late 1962, Blues Incorporated continued to record, with Korner at the helm, until 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; However, by that time its originally stellar line-up (and crowd of followers) had mostly left to start their own bands. While his one-time acolytes, the Rolling Stones and [[Cream (band)|Cream]], made the front pages of music magazines all over the world, Korner was relegated to the role of 'elder statesman'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt;

In 1966, Korner formed the trio Free At Last with [[Hughie Flint]] and [[Binky McKenzie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Flint later recalled “I played with Alexis, right after leaving [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers|The Bluesbreakers]], in a trio, which Alexis named ''Free At Last'', a sort of mini and slightly restricted version of [[Blues Incorporated]]. Playing with Alexis was very loose. We would play anything from [[Percy Mayfield|Percy Mayfield’s]] ‘River’s Invitation’ to [[Charles Mingus|Charles Mingus's]] ‘Better Get It In Your Soul’ – with lots of freaky guitar and bass solos. Alexis, like [[John Mayall]] had the most eclectic taste in music, very knowledgeable, and generous, and I am indebted to both of them for my wide approach to music”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blues.gr/m/blogpost?id=1982923%3ABlogPost%3A227958 |title=Veteran British drummer Hughie Flint talks about the Blues, Jazz, Beano album, and Buddha’s teaching |publisher=Michael Limnios Blues Network |date= 9 September 2015 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Free At Last'' was short lived, Korner ensured its name lived on in part by christening another young group of aspiring musicians [[Free (band)|&quot;Free&quot;]]. Korner was instrumental in the formation of the band in April 1968 and continued to mentor them until they secured a deal with [[Island Records]].

Although he himself was a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians during the blues boom of the late 1960s for their blind adherence to [[Chicago blues]], as if the music came in no other form. He liked to surround himself with [[jazz]] musicians such as [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] and [[Binky McKenzie]] and often performed with a [[horn section]] drawn from a pool that included, among others, saxophone players [[Art Themen]], [[Mel Collins]], [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]], [[Lol Coxhill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9932/chodg_s.htm |title=Colin Hodgkinson sessions (The Musicians' Olympus) |publisher=Reocities.com |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203249/http://reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9932/chodg_s.htm |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Morrissey]], [[John Surman]] and [[trombonist]] [[Mike Zwerin]].

==Broadcasting==
In the 1960s, Korner began a media career, working initially as a show business interviewer and then on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''Five O'Clock Club'', a children's TV show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Korner also wrote about blues for the music papers, and continued to maintain his own career as a blues artist, especially in Europe.

On 17 October 1967, Korner interviewed [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] for the [[BBC]] radio show ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]''. Some of these tracks, including audio of Korner himself, appear on the Hendrix double-CD ''[[BBC Sessions (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|BBC Sessions]]'', including Korner playing slide guitar on &quot;[[(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man]]&quot;.

While touring [[Scandinavia]] he formed the band New Church with guitarist and singer [[Peter Thorup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; They subsequently were one of the support bands at the [[Stones in the Park|Rolling Stones Free Concert]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, on 5 July 1969. [[Jimmy Page]] reportedly found out about a new singer, [[Robert Plant]], who had been jamming with Korner, who wondered why Plant had not yet been discovered. Plant and Korner were recording an album with Plant on vocals until Page had asked him to join &quot;the New [[Yardbirds]]&quot;, a.k.a. [[Led Zeppelin]]. Only two songs are in circulation from these recordings: &quot;Steal Away&quot; and &quot;Operator&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt; Korner gave one of his last radio interviews to BBC Midlands on the ''Record Collectors Show'' with Mike Adams and Chris Savory.

===1970s===
{{Main|Collective Consciousness Society}}
[[Image:Alexis Korner 1968 Bremen.jpg|thumb|160px|Korner and [[Peter Thorup]] in [[Bremen]]]]
In 1970, Korner and Thorup formed a big-band ensemble, [[C. C. S. (pop group)|CCS]] – short for &quot;The Collective Consciousness Society&quot; – which had several hit singles produced by [[Mickie Most]], including a version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;, which was used as the theme for BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' between 1970 and 1981. Another instrumental called &quot;Brother&quot; was used as the theme to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Top 20/40 when [[Tom Browne (broadcaster and actor)|Tom Browne]]/[[Simon Bates]] presented the programme in the 1970s. It was also used in the 1990s on Radio Luxembourg for the Top 20 Singles chart. This was the period of Korner's greatest commercial success in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt; In 1973, he provided a voice part for the [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]] single release [[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=10625 |title=Brother Louie by Hot Chocolate |website=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s to 1984===
[[Image:Alexis Korner musician.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Korner with Snape]]
In 1973, he and Peter Thorup formed another group, Snape, with [[Boz Burrell]], [[Mel Collins]], and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]], who were previously together in [[King Crimson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; Korner also played on [[B.B. King]]'s ''In London'' album, and cut his own, similar &quot;supersession&quot; album; ''Get Off My Cloud'', with [[Keith Richards]], [[Steve Marriott]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and members of [[Joe Cocker]]'s [[The Grease Band|Grease Band]]. In the mid-1970s, while touring Germany, Korner established an intensive working relationship with bassist [[Colin Hodgkinson]] who played for the support act [[Back Door (jazz trio)|Back Door]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; They would continue to collaborate right up until Korner's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

In the 1970s, Korner's main career was in broadcasting. In 1973, he presented a unique 6-part documentary on [[BBC Radio 1]], ''The Rolling Stones Story'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ibndjr&quot;&gt;[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403083203/http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm|date=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 he established a Sunday-night blues and soul show on Radio 1, ''Alexis Korner's Blues and Soul Show'', which ran until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; He also used his gravelly voice to great effect as an advertising voice-over artist. In 1978, for Korner's 50th birthday, an all-star concert was held featuring many of his above-mentioned friends, as well as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Zoot Money]] and others, which was later released as ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner album)|The Party Album]]'', and as a video.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt;

In 1981, Korner joined another &quot;supergroup&quot;, [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], a project led by [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based on [[boogie-woogie]] keyboard players, which featured a [[rhythm section]] comprising [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Charlie Watts]], among others, as well as a [[horn section]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt; They toured Europe and released an album on [[Atlantic Records]]. He played in Italy with [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] and the Blues Society of Italian bluesman Guido Toffoletti.

==Family life and death==
In 1950, Korner married Roberta Melville, daughter of art critic [[Robert Melville (art critic)|Robert Melville]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Obituaries: Alexis Korner, 3 January 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Korner died of [[lung cancer]] aged 55 years, on 1 January 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;/&gt;  He was survived by a daughter, singer Sappho Gillett Korner (died 2006) and two sons, guitarist Nicholas 'Nico' Korner (died 1988) and sound engineer Damian Korner (died 2008).
