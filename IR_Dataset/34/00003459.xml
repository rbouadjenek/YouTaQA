Little is known of Benin's early history. From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], along with the city-state of [[Porto-Novo]], and a large area with many different nations to the north. This region was referred to as the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of enslaved people who were shipped to the New World during the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. After enslavement was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. The [[sovereign state]] has had a tumultuous history since then, with many different democratic governments, military coups, and military governments. A [[Marxist–Leninist state]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the current [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] Republic of Benin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibp Usa p85&quot;&gt;''Ibp Usa.

===Precolonial period===
[[File:Kingdom of Dahomy-1793.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], 1793.]]
The current country of Benin combines three areas which had distinctly different political systems and ethnicities prior to French colonial control. Before 1700, there were a few important city-states along the coast (primarily of the [[Aja people|Aja]] ethnic group, but also including [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] peoples) and a mass of tribal regions inland (composed of [[Bariba people|Bariba]], Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye peoples). The [[Oyo Empire]], located primarily to the east of modern Benin, was the most significant large-scale military force in the region. It regularly conducted raids and exacted tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bay-1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], consisting mostly of [[Fon people]], was founded on the [[Abomey]] plateau and began taking over areas along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akinjogbin|first=I.A.|title=Dahomey and Its Neighbors: 1708–1818|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|oclc=469476592|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1727, king [[Agaja]] of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of [[Allada]] and [[Ouidah|Whydah]], but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of [[Porto-Novo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Law-1986&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=Dahomey and the Slave Trade: Reflections on the Historiography of the Rise of Dahomey|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1986|volume=27|issue=2|pages=237–267|doi=10.1017/s0021853700036665}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey, the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo, and the continued tribal politics of the northern region, persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creevey|first1=Lucy|last2=Ngomo|first2=Paul|last3=Vengroff|first3=Richard|title=Party Politics and Different Paths to Democratic Transitions: A Comparison of Benin and Senegal|journal=Party Politics|year=2005|volume=11|issue=4|pages=471–493|doi=10.1177/1354068805053213|url=https://zenodo.org/record/897004/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dahomey|Dahomey Kingdom]] was known for its culture and traditions. Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers, and taught the kingdom's military customs until they were old enough to join the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harms2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Harms|first=Robert W.|title=The Diligent: A Voyage Through the Worlds of the Slave Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0YILMba_EnoC|year=2002|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-02872-6|page=172|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509061636/https://books.google.com/books?id=0YILMba_EnoC|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahomey was also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corps, called [[Ahosi]], i.e. the king's wives, or Mino, &quot;our mothers&quot; in the Fon language [[Fongbe]], and known by many Europeans as the Dahomean [[Amazons]]. This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of &quot;black [[Sparta]]&quot; from European observers and 19th-century explorers such as [[Sir Richard Burton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpern1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpern|first=Stanley B.|title=Amazons of Black Sparta: The Women Warriors of Dahomey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fdtg4e5_WoIC|year=1998|publisher=C.

===Early Portuguese colonization and the slave trade===
[[File:São João Baptista de Ajudá 1886 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Portuguese Empire]] was the longest colonial presence in Benin, beginning in 1680 and ending in 1961, when the last forces left [[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá|Ajudá]].]]
The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,91575,00.html African Ambassador Apologizes for Slavery Role] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522233737/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,91575,00.html |date=22 May 2010 }}.

By about 1750, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling African captives to European slave-traders.&lt;ref name=&quot;dahomey&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml African Slave Owners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308014748/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml |date=8 March 2013 }} the story of South Africa|BBC World Service&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the leaders of Dahomey appear to have initially resisted the slave trade, it flourished in the region of Dahomey for almost three hundred years, beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] merchants. The area was named the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|&quot;Slave Coast&quot;]] because of this flourishing trade. Court protocols, which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's many battles be decapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area. The number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=Slavery, Colonialism and Economic Growth in Dahomey, 1640–1960|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline was partly due to the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] banning the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] by Britain in 1808, followed by other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;dahomey&quot;/&gt; This decline continued until 1885, when the last slave ship departed from the coast of the modern Benin Republic bound for [[Brazil]] in South America, which had yet to abolish slavery. The capital's name [[Porto-Novo]] is of Portuguese origin, meaning &quot;New Port&quot;. It was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, Dahomey had begun to weaken and lose its status as the regional power. This enabled the French to take over the area in 1892. In 1899, the French included the land called [[French Dahomey]] within the larger [[French West Africa]] colonial region.

In 1958, France granted autonomy to the [[Republic of Dahomey]], and full independence on 1 August 1960, which is celebrated each year as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Benin|national holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://apanews.net/en/news/president-sirleaf-congratulates-benin-on-57th-independence-anniversary |title=President Sirleaf congratulates Benin on 57th Independence Anniversary |date=31 July 2017 |work=Agence de Presse Africane |access-date=30 July 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730234816/http://apanews.net/en/news/president-sirleaf-congratulates-benin-on-57th-independence-anniversary |archive-date=30 July 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president who led the country to independence was [[Hubert Maga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stokes|editor-first=Jamie|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East: L to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaFvrgEACAAJ|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7158-6|page=229|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171808/https://books.google.com/books?id=gaFvrgEACAAJ|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Araujo2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Araujo|first=Ana Lucia|title=Public Memory of Slavery: Victims and Perpetrators in the South Atlantic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kymzngEACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-60497-714-1|page=111|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617084013/https://books.google.com/books?id=kymzngEACAAJ|archive-date=17 June 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-colonial period===
For the next twelve years after 1960, ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence. There were several coups and regime changes, with the figures of [[Hubert Maga]], [[Sourou Migan Apithy|Sourou Apithy]], [[Justin Ahomadégbé]], and [[Émile Derlin Zinsou]] dominating; the first three each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country. These three agreed to form a [[Presidential Council (Benin)|Presidential Council]] after violence marred the 1970 elections.

On 7 May 1972, Maga ceded power to Ahomadégbé. On 26 October 1972, Lt. Col. [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and stating that the country would not &quot;burden itself by copying foreign [[ideology]], and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism&quot;. On 30 November 1974 however, he announced that the country was officially [[Marxism|Marxist]], under control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CMR), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On 30 November 1975, he renamed the country to the '''[[People's Republic of Benin]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickovick2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Dickovick, J.

The CMR was dissolved in 1979, and Kérékou arranged [[show election]]s in which he was the only allowed candidate. Establishing relations with [[China]], [[North Korea]], and [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]], he put nearly all businesses and economic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in Benin to dry up.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benin|author=Kneib, Martha|pages=[https://archive.org/details/benin0000knei/page/22 22–25]|isbn=0-7614-2328-1|date=7 January 2007|url=https://archive.org/details/benin0000knei/page/22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kérékou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own aphorisms such as &quot;Poverty is not a fatality&quot;, resulting in a mass [[emigration|exodus]] of teachers, along with numerous other professionals.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;/&gt; The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste, first from the Soviet Union and later from France.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;/&gt;

In 1980, Kérékou converted to [[Islam]] and changed his first name to Ahmed. He changed his name back after claiming to be a [[born-again Christian]]. In 1989, riots broke out when the regime did not have enough money to pay its army. The banking system collapsed. Eventually, Kérékou renounced [[Marxism]], and a convention forced Kérékou to release political prisoners and arrange elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;/&gt; [[Marxism–Leninism]] was abolished as the nation's form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialist.net/history-people-s-republic-of-benin.htm|title=A Short History of the People's Republic of Benin (1974–1990)|publisher=Socialist.net|date=27 August 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423134048/http://www.socialist.net/history-people-s-republic-of-benin.htm|archive-date=23 April 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's name was officially changed to the'' Republic of Benin'' on 1 March 1990, after the newly formed government's [[constitution]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/bj.html|title=Benin|publisher=Flagspot.net|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612012647/http://flagspot.net/flags/bj.html|archive-date=12 June 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BoniYayi inauguration2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Boni Yayi|Yayi Boni]]'s 2006 presidential inauguration]]
In a 1991 election, Kérékou lost to [[Nicéphore Soglo]]. Kérékou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote. In 2001, a closely fought election resulted in Kérékou winning another term, after which his opponents claimed election irregularities.

In 1999, Kérékou issued a national apology for the substantial role that Africans had played in the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]], &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all Ending the Slavery Blame-Game] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307174002/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all |date=7 March 2017 }}&quot;. ''The New York Times'', 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Kérékou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections, as both were barred by the constitution's restrictions on age and total terms of candidates.

On 5 March 2006, [[Beninese presidential election, 2006|an election]] was held that was considered free and fair. It resulted in a [[Two-round system|runoff]] between [[Thomas Boni Yayi|Yayi Boni]] and [[Adrien Houngbédji]]. The runoff election was held on 19 March and was won by Boni, who assumed office on 6 April. The success of the fair multi-party elections in Benin won praise internationally. Boni was [[Beninese presidential election, 2011|reelected in 2011]], taking 53.18% of the vote in the first round—enough to avoid a runoff election. He was the first president to win an election without a runoff since the restoration of democracy in 1991.

In the [[Beninese presidential election, 2016|March 2016 presidential elections]], in which Boni Yayi was barred by the constitution from running for a third term, businessman [[Patrice Talon]] won the second round with 65.37% of the vote, defeating investment banker and former Prime Minister [[Lionel Zinsou]]. Talon was sworn in on 6 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-benin-election-idUSKCN0X31QO|title=Businessman sworn in as Benin's president|date=6 April 2016|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=1 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417043022/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-benin-election-idUSKCN0X31QO|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the same day that the Constitutional Court confirmed the results, Talon said that he would &quot;first and foremost tackle constitutional reform&quot;, discussing his plan to limit presidents to a single term of five years in order to combat &quot;complacency&quot;. He also said that he planned to slash the size of the government from 28 to 16 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-benin-election-idUSKCN0WS08X|title=Newly-elected Benin president aims to reduce presidential terms|date=26 March 2016|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=1 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503063033/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-benin-election-idUSKCN0WS08X|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Politics of Benin}}&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;
Benin's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], in which the [[President of Benin]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], within a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the legislature. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The political system is derived from the 1990 [[Constitution of Benin]] and the subsequent transition to [[democracy]] in 1991.

Benin scored highly in the 2013 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]], which comprehensively measures the state of governance across the continent. Benin was ranked 18th out of 52 African countries and scored best in the categories of Safety &amp; Rule of Law and Participation &amp; Human Rights.&lt;ref name=IIAG&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG)|publisher=[[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]|date=2014|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/interact/|accessdate=16 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530015728/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/interact/|archivedate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benin is divided into 12 [[Department (subnational entity)|department]]s (French: ''départements'') which, in turn, are subdivided into 77 [[Commune (subnational entity)|communes]]. In 1999, the previous six departments were each split into two halves, forming the current 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url= http://www.statoids.com/ubj.html|title=Statoids - Benin| access-date= 26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six new departments were assigned official capitals in 2008.

{{main|Religion in Benin}}
In the 2013 census, 49.5% of the population of Benin were [[Christianity|Christian]] (25.5% [[Roman Catholic]], 6.7% [[Celestial Church of Christ]], 3.4% [[Methodist]], 12.9% other Christian denominations), 27.7% were [[Muslim]], 11.6% practiced [[Vodun]], 2.6% practiced other local traditional religions, 2.6% practiced other religions, and 5.8% claimed no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insae-bj.org/images/docs/insae-statistiques/enquetes-recensements/RGPH/1.RGPH_4/Indicateurs-et-Projetcions/Principaux%20Indicateurs%20projections%20Preface%20RGPH4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90082.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Benin] .

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent government survey conducted by the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] Program in 2011-2012 indicated that Christianity had increased to 57.5% of the population (with Catholics making up 33.9%, Methodists 3.0%, Celestials 6.2% and other Christians 14.5%), while Muslims had declined to 22.8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHS 2011-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR270/FR270.pdf|title=Enquête Démographique et de Santé (EDSB-IV) 2011-2012|publisher=Ministère du Développement, de l'Analyse Économique et de la Prospective Institut National de la Statistique et de l'Analyse Économique (INSAE)|page=39|language=French|accessdate=20 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623015547/http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr270/fr270.pdf|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional religions include local [[animism|animistic]] religions in the [[Atakora Department|Atakora]] (Atakora and Donga provinces), and [[Vodun]] and [[Orisha]] veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples in the center and south of the nation. The town of [[Ouidah]] on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun.

Today the two largest religions are Christianity, followed throughout the south and center of Benin and in [[Otammari]] country in the [[Atakora Department|Atakora]], and Islam, introduced by the [[Songhai Empire]] and Hausa merchants, and now followed throughout [[Alibori]], [[Borgou]] and [[Donga Department|Donga]] provinces, as well as among the Yoruba (who also follow Christianity). Many, however, continue to hold Vodun and Orisha beliefs and have incorporated the pantheon of Vodun and Orisha into Christianity. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], a sect originating in the 19th century, is also present in a significant minority.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Benin|Climate of Benin}}
[[File:Benin map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Benin map of Köppen climate classification.]]

Benin, a narrow, north-south strip of land in West Africa, lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0°]] and [[4th meridian east|4°E]]. Benin is bounded by Togo to the west, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]] to the north, [[Nigeria]] to the east, and the [[Bight of Benin]] to the south. The distance from the [[Niger River]] in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the south is about {{convert|650|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Although the coastline measures {{convert|121|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, the country measures about {{convert|325|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} at its widest point.

[[File:Atakora Benin Batia.jpg|thumb|[[Atakora Department|Atakora]], one of Benin's two northernmost departments.]]
[[File:West African male lion.jpg|thumb|left|The Pendjari National Park in Benin is one of the most important reserves for the [[West African lion]] and other large animals of West Africa.]]
Benin shows little variation in elevation and can be divided into four areas from the south to the north, starting with the low-lying, sandy, coastal plain (highest elevation {{convert|10|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}) which is, at most, {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} wide. It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean. Behind the coast lies the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]]-covered plateaus of southern Benin (altitude between {{convert|20|and|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}), which are split by valleys running north to south along the [[Couffo River|Couffo]], [[Zou River|Zou]], and [[Ouémé River]]s.

An area of flat land dotted with rocky hills whose altitude seldom reaches {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} extends around Nikki and Save.

A range of mountains extends along the northwest border and into Togo; these are the [[Togo Mountains|Atacora]]. The highest point, [[Mont Sokbaro]], is at {{convert|658|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Benin has fallow fields, [[mangrove]]s, and remnants of large sacred forests. In the rest of the country, the savanna is covered with thorny scrub and dotted with huge [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] trees. Some forests line the banks of rivers. In the north and the northwest of Benin, the [[W National Park|Reserve du W du Niger]] and [[Pendjari National Park]] attract tourists eager to see elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos, and monkeys.&lt;ref name=bn&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm &quot;Background Note: Benin&quot;] .

Benin's climate is hot and humid. Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300&amp;nbsp;mm or about 51&amp;nbsp;inches. Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September. Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast. In [[Cotonou]], the average maximum temperature is {{convert|31|°C|1}}; the minimum is {{convert|24|°C|1}}.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Variations in temperature increase when moving north through [[savanna]] and plateau toward the [[Sahel]]. A dry wind from the Sahara called the [[Harmattan]] blows from December to March, when grass dries up, other vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be overcast. It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

[[File:Extensive Landwirtschaft im Norden Benins bei Djougou.jpg|thumb|Extensive agriculture in north of Benin, near Djougou.]]
The economy of Benin is dependent on [[subsistence agriculture]], [[cotton]] production, and regional trade. Cotton accounts for 40% of the [[GDP]] and roughly 80% of official [[export]] receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm|title=Background Note: Benin|publisher=State.gov|date=3 February 2010|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in real output has averaged around 5% in the past seven years, but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase.{{when|date=February 2018}} Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Benin uses the [[CFA franc]], which is pegged to the euro.

Benin's economy has continued to strengthen over the past years, with real GDP growth estimated at 5.1 and 5.7% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The main driver of growth is the agricultural sector, with cotton being the country's main export, while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP largely because of Benin's geographical location, enabling trade, transportation, transit and tourism activities with its neighboring states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Benin: Financial Sector profile |accessdate=30 November 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513105544/http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 }}. MFW4A.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gossypium sp MS4007.JPG|thumb|Cotton field in northern Benin.]]
In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on [[Tourism in Benin|tourism]], facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's US$307 million [[Millennium Challenge Account]] grant signed in February 2006.&lt;ref name=MCC&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 Benin Compact Summary|website=Millennium Challenge Corporation|date=2006|url=https://assets.mcc.gov/agreements/022206_benin_compact_summary.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203153130/https://assets.mcc.gov/agreements/022206_benin_compact_summary.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Club]] and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bn.html Benin]. CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[trade unions in Benin]] represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of [[child labour|child labor]], and the continuing issue of [[unfree labour|forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious violations of core labour standards in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali|work=ICFTU Online|url=http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=991220267&amp;Language=EN|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benin is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa|url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php|accessdate=22 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033744/http://www.ohada.com/index.php|archive-date=26 March 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotonou has the country's only seaport and [[Cadjehoun Airport|international airport]]. A new port is currently under construction between Cotonou and Porto Novo. Benin is connected by two-lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries (Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria). Mobile telephone service is available across the country through various [[Mobile Network Code|operators]]. ADSL connections are available in some areas. Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections (since 1998) and a single submarine cable [[SAT-3/WASC (cable system)|SAT-3/WASC]] (since 2001), keeping the price of data extremely high. Relief is expected with the initiation of the [[ACE (cable system)|Africa Coast to Europe]] cable in 2011.

Despite the GDP growth rate of 4-5% remaining consistent over the past two decades, poverty has been increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/benin/overview|title=The World Bank In Benin|date=10 October 2017|website=The World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309013038/http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/benin/overview|archive-date=9 March 2018|url-status=live|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Analysis in Benin, those living under the poverty line have increased from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benin: Request for a Three-year Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility-Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Benin|last=International Monetary Fund.

==Education==
[[File:BEN 2001-007-S20.jpg|thumb|Beninese students.]]
{{main|Education in Benin}}
The [[literacy]] rate in Benin is among the lowest in the world: in 2015 it was estimated to be 38.4% (49.9% for males and 27.3% for females).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt; Benin has achieved universal primary education and half of the children (54%) were enrolled in secondary education in 2013, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]].

Although at one time the education system was not free,&lt;ref name=&quot;ilab&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/af/861.htm|title=Benin|date=23 February 2001|publisher=U.

The government has devoted more than 4% of GDP to education since 2009. In 2015, public expenditure on education (all levels) amounted to 4.4% of GDP, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Within this expenditure, Benin devoted quite a large share to tertiary education: 0.97% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=West Africa.

Between 2009 and 2011, the share of young people enrolled at university rose from 10% to 12% of the 18''–''25 year age cohort, one of the highest ratios in West Africa. Student enrollment in tertiary education more than doubled between 2006 and 2011 from 50,225 to 110,181. These statistics encompass not only bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. programmes but also students enrolled in non-degree post-secondary diplomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Benin}}

=== National policy framework ===
The [[Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research]] is responsible for implementing science policy. The [[National Directorate of Scientific and Technological Research]] handles planning and coordination, whereas the [[National Council for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters]] each play an advisory role. Financial support comes from Benin's [[National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation]]. [[The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation]] carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 till date when the country's first science policy was prepared. This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations (2013);
* a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation (2013) for competitive grants;
* a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014;
* a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation (under development in 2015).
Equally important are Benin's efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents:
* ''Benin Development Strategies 2025'': ''Benin 2025 Alafia'' (2000);
* Growt''h Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011–2016'' (2011);
* Phase 3 of the ''Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector'', covering 2013–2015;
* ''Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 2013–2017'' (2014).
In 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The main challenges facing research and development in Benin are:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* the unfavorable organizational framework for research: weak governance, a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers;
* the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers; and 
* the mismatch between research and development needs.

=== Human and financial investment in research ===
In 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in headcounts). This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants. The main research structures in Benin are the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research, National Institute of Agricultural Research, National Institute for Training and Research in Education, Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for Entomological Research.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the [[World Bank]] in 2014 to participate in its Centres of Excellence project, owing to its expertise in applied mathematics. Within this project, the World Bank has loaned $8 million to Benin. The Association of African Universities has also received funds to enable it to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa involved in the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

There are no available data on Benin's level of investment in research and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 2013, the government devoted 2.5% of GDP to public health. In December 2014, 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, as part of a joint initiative by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) a&lt;nowiki/&gt;nd its specialized agency, the West African Health Organisation, to help combat the epidemic. The Ebola epidemic has been a tragic reminder of the chronic underinvestment in West African health systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The Government of Benin devoted less than 5% of GDP to agricultural development in 2010, even though the members of the [[African Union]] had agreed to commit at least 10% of GDP to this area in the ''Maputo Declaration'' of 2003. They reiterated this goal in the ''Malabo Declaration'' adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|title=One Applauds AU Malabo Declaration's Recommitment to Agriculture Transformation|date=2 July 2014|work=ONE.org|access-date=12 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010183945/https://www.one.org/africa/press/one-applauds-au-malabo-declarations-re-commitment-to-agriculture-transformation/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research output ===
Benin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded. There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants cataloged in this database in 2014. This compares with 65.0 for the Gambia, 49.6 for Cape Verde, 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana. The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's main scientific collaborators were based in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254), Belgium (198) and Germany (156).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Transportation==
{{main|Transport in Benin}}
[[Transport in Benin]] includes road, rail, water and air transportation. Benin possesses a total of 6,787&amp;nbsp;km of [[highway]], of which 1,357&amp;nbsp;km are paved. Of the paved highways in the country, there are 10 [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]]. This leaves 5,430&amp;nbsp;km of unpaved road. The [[Trans–West African Coastal Highway|Trans-West African Coastal Highway]] crosses Benin, connecting it to [[Nigeria]] to the east, and [[Togo]], [[Ghana]] and [[Ivory Coast]] to the west. When construction in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] is finished, the highway will continue west to seven other [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) nations. A paved highway also connects Benin northwards to [[Niger]], and through that country to [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the north-west.

[[Rail transport in Benin]] consists of {{convert|578|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of [[Single track (rail)|single track]], {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} railway. Benin does not, at this time, share railway links with adjacent countries, but construction work has commenced on international lines connecting Benin with Niger and Nigeria, with outline plans announced for further connections to Togo and Burkina Faso. Benin will be a participant in the [[AfricaRail]] project.

[[Cadjehoun Airport]], located at Cotonou, has direct international jet service to [[Accra]], Niamey, [[Monrovia]], [[Lagos]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Lomé]], and [[Douala]], as well as other cities in Africa. Direct services also link Cotonou to Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul.

The [[HIV/AIDS]] rate in Benin was estimated in 2013 at 1.13% of adults aged 15–49 years.&lt;ref name=CIA3&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV/AIDS—Adult Prevalence Rate|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|accessdate=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221190412/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|archive-date=21 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaria]] is a problem in Benin, being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children younger than five years.&lt;ref name=Malaria&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria in Benin|website=malaria.com|date=24 February 2011|url=http://www.malaria.com/featured/malaria-beni|accessdate=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122100605/http://www.malaria.com/featured/malaria-beni|archive-date=22 January 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, less than 30% of the country's population had access to primary health care services. Benin had one of the highest death rates for children under the age of five in the world. Its [[infant mortality rate]] stood at 203 deaths for every {{gaps|1|000}} live births. Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services. The [[Bamako Initiative]] changed that dramatically by introducing community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/inf-new/child6.htm|title=Bamako Initiative revitalizes primary health care in Benin|publisher=WHO.int|accessdate=28 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133809/http://www.who.int/inf-new/child6.htm|archive-date=6 January 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, Benin had the 26th highest rate of [[maternal mortality]] in the world.&lt;ref name=CIA2&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality Rate|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|accessdate=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418113820/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|archive-date=18 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 13% of women had undergone [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p27&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405083031/http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf |date=5 April 2015 }}.

[[File:Who's coming ?.jpg|thumb|Traditional music group.]]
Beninese literature had a strong oral tradition long before French became the dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benin|url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/CountryBeninEN.html|accessdate=30 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813054658/http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/CountryBeninEN.html|archive-date=13 August 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Couchoro]] wrote the first Beninese novel, ''[[L'Esclave (Beninese novel)|L'Esclave]]'' (The Slave), in 1929.

Post-independence, the country was home to a vibrant and innovative music scene, where native folk music combined with [[Ghana]]ian [[highlife]], French [[cabaret]], American [[rock and roll|rock]], [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]], and [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[African Rumba|rumba]].

Singer [[Angélique Kidjo]] and actor [[Djimon Hounsou]] were born in Cotonou, Benin. Composer [[Wally Badarou]] and singer [[Gnonnas Pedro]] are also of Beninese descent.

Biennale Benin, continuing the projects of several organizations and artists, started in the country in 2010 as a collaborative event called &quot;Regard Benin&quot;. In 2012, the project became a Biennial coordinated by the Consortium, a federation of local associations. The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012 Biennale Benin are curated by Abdellah Karroum and the Curatorial Delegation.

A number of Beninese artists have received major international recognition, such as [[Georges Adéagbo]], [[Meschac Gaba]], [[Romuald Hazoumè]], [[Dominique Zinkpè]] and [[Emo de Medeiros]].

===Customary names===
Many Beninese in the south of the country have [[Akan name|Akan-based names]] indicating the day of the week on which they were born. This is due to influence of the [[Akan people]] like the [[Akwamu]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/Akwamu Akwamu – Encyclopedia Article and More from] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122016/http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/akwamu |date=12 January 2012 }}. Merriam-Webster (13 August 2010), retrieved 15 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{main|Languages of Benin}}
Local languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French only introduced after several years. In wealthier cities, however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. At the secondary School level, local language is generally forbidden and French is the sole language of instruction. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s are written ''é è, ô, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, ɛ, o, ɔ}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s are written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''ŋ'' and ''c.'' However, digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/fõ ɡ͡be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Bahia acaraje.jpg|thumb|[[Acarajé]] is peeled [[black-eyed pea]]s formed into a ball and then deep-fried.]]
{{main|Benin cuisine}}
Beninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes. Beninese cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, the most common ingredient is [[Maize|corn]], often used to prepare [[dough]] which is mainly served with [[peanut]]- or [[tomato]]-based [[sauce]]s. [[Fish]] and [[chicken]] are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine, but [[beef]], [[goat]], and [[Aethomys|bush rat]] are also consumed. The main staple in northern Benin is [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and [[pork]] meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. [[Cheese]] is used in some dishes. [[Couscous]], rice, and [[bean]]s are commonly eaten, along with fruits such as [[mango]]es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.

Meat is usually quite expensive, and meals are generally light on meat and generous on [[vegetable fat]]. Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation, and [[smoked fish]] is commonly prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare [[Cornmeal|corn flour]], which is made into a dough and served with sauces. &quot;Chicken on the spit&quot; is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.

===Sports===
[[Association football|Football]] is generally considered the most popular sport in Benin. In the past decade, [[baseball]] has been introduced to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Mozey, Brian.
