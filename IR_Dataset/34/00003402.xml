A '''bead''' is a small, decorative object that is formed in a variety of shapes and sizes of a material such as stone, bone, shell, glass, plastic, wood or pearl and with a small hole for [[yarn|threading]] or stringing. Beads range in size from under {{convert|1|mm|in}} to over {{convert|1|cm|in}} in diameter. A pair of beads made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' sea snail shells, approximately 100,000 years old, are thought to be the earliest known examples of [[jewellery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1670011.htm|title=News in Science - Shell beads suggest new roots for culture - 23/06/2006|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/24/9964|title=82,000-year-old shell beads from North Africa and implications for the origins of modern human behavior|first1=Abdeljalil|last1=Bouzouggar|first2=Nick|last2=Barton|first3=Marian|last3=Vanhaeren|first4=Francesco|last4=d'Errico|first5=Simon|last5=Collcutt|first6=Tom|last6=Higham|first7=Edward|last7=Hodge|first8=Simon|last8=Parfitt|first9=Edward|last9=Rhodes|first10=Jean-Luc|last10=Schwenninger|first11=Chris|last11=Stringer|first12=Elaine|last12=Turner|first13=Steven|last13=Ward|first14=Abdelkrim|last14=Moutmir|first15=Abdelhamid|last15=Stambouli|date=12 June 2007|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=24|pages=9964–9969|accessdate=23 October 2017|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.0703877104|pmid=17548808|pmc=1891266}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beadwork]] is the art or craft of making things with beads. Beads can be woven together with specialized [[yarn|thread]], strung onto thread or soft, flexible [[wire]], or adhered to a surface (e.g. [[Cloth|fabric]], [[clay]]).

==Types of beads==
[[Image:Cloisonnebeads.jpg|thumb|right|Cloisonné beads]]
Beads can be divided into several types of overlapping categories based on different criteria such as the materials from which they are made, the process used in their manufacturing, the place or period of origin, the patterns on their surface, or their general shape. In some cases, such as [[millefiori]] and [[cloisonné]] beads, multiple categories may overlap in an interdependent fashion.

==Components==
Beads can be made of many different materials. The earliest beads were made of a variety of natural materials which, after they were gathered, could be readily drilled and shaped. As humans became capable of obtaining and working with more difficult materials, those materials were added to the range of available substances. But nowadays synthetic materials were added.

In modern manufacturing, the most common bead materials are wood, [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[metal]], and [[Rock (geology)|stone]].

=== Natural materials ===
Beads are still made from many naturally occurring materials, both organic (i.e., of [[animal]]- or [[plant]]-based origin) and inorganic (purely [[mineral]] origin). However, some of these materials now routinely undergo some extra processing beyond mere shaping and drilling such as color enhancement via [[dyes]] or irradiation.

The natural organics include [[bone]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[ivory]], [[seed]]s (such as [[tagua]] nuts), [[animal shell]], and [[wood]]. For most of human history [[pearl]]s were the ultimate precious beads of natural origin because of their rarity; the modern [[cultured pearl|pearl-culturing process]] has made them far more common. [[Amber]] and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] are also of natural organic origin although both are the result of partial [[fossil]]ization.

The natural inorganics include various types of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s, ranging from [[gemstone]]s to common [[mineral]]s, and [[metal]]s. Of the latter, only a few [[precious metal]]s occur in pure forms, but other purified [[base metal]]s may as well be placed in this category along with certain naturally occurring alloys such as [[electrum]]. There are also paper beads.

=== Synthetic materials ===

[[File:Swedish patent 217875 Sätt att för arbetsterapi.pdf|thumb|upright|page=3|Swedish patent 217875: The plastic bead pegboard (1962).]]

The oldest-surviving synthetic materials used for beadmaking have generally been [[ceramic]]s: [[pottery]] and [[glass]]. Beads were also made from ancient alloys such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]], but as those were more vulnerable to [[oxidation]] they have generally been less well-preserved at archaeological sites.

Many different subtypes of [[glass]] are now used for beadmaking, some of which have their own component-specific names. [[Lead crystal]] beads have a high percentage of [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] in the glass formula, increasing the [[refractive index]]. Most of the other named glass types have their formulations and patterns inseparable from the manufacturing process.

Small, colourful, [[fusible plastic beads]] (some brands are Nabbi, Hama, Perler, and Pyssla) can be placed on a solid plastic-backed peg array to form designs and then melted together with a [[Ironing|clothes iron]]; alternatively, they can be strung into necklaces and bracelets or woven into keychains. Fusible beads come in many colors and degrees of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]]/[[opacity (optics)|opacity]], including varieties that glow in the dark or have internal [[glitter]]; peg boards come in various shapes and several geometric patterns. Plastic toy beads, made by chopping plastic tubes into short pieces, were introduced in 1958 by Munkplast AB in [[Munka-Ljungby]], Sweden. Known as [[Indian bead]]s, they were originally sewn together to form ribbons. The pegboard for bead designs was invented in the early 1960s (patented 1962, patent granted 1967) by Gunnar Knutsson in Vällingby, Sweden, as a therapy for elderly homes; the pegboard later gained popularity as a toy for children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://was.prv.se/spd/search?content=SE+217875&amp;lang=en&amp;tab=1&amp;hits=true Swedish patent 217875: Sätt att för arbetsterapi e.d. framställa permanenta, mönstrade skivor samt möstrad skiva framställd enligt sättet], applied April 24, 1962; granted July 6, 1967; published December 19, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2YdeOnMtPI|title=Danya's Perler beads 2014 (four year old)|first=|last=Arun Jagatheesan|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bead designs were glued to cardboard or [[Masonite]] boards and used as [[trivet]]s. Later, when the beads were made of [[polyethylene]], it became possible to fuse them with a flat iron. Hama come in three sizes: mini (diameter 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm), midi (5&amp;nbsp;mm) and maxi (10&amp;nbsp;mm). Perler beads come in two sizes called classic (5&amp;nbsp;mm) and biggie (10&amp;nbsp;mm). Pyssla beads (by [[IKEA]]) only come in one size (5&amp;nbsp;mm).

==Manufacturing==
Modern [[mass production|mass-produced]] beads are generally shaped by [[carving]] or [[casting]], depending on the material and desired effect. In some cases, more specialized [[metalworking]] or [[glass]]working techniques may be employed, or a combination of multiple techniques and materials may be used such as in [[cloisonné]].

=== Glassworking ===
[[Image:Pressedglass.jpg|thumb|right|Pressed glass beads (matte finish with an AB coating)]]
[[File:Assorted beads in a box 23June2019 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A box of assorted beads]]
Most glass beads are [[pressed glass]], mass-produced by preparing a molten batch of [[Glass coloring and color marking|glass of the desired color]] and pouring it into molds to form the desired shape. This is also true of most [[plastic]] beads.

A smaller and more expensive subset of glass and lead crystal beads are cut into precise faceted shapes on an individual basis. This was once done by hand but has largely been taken over by precision machinery.

&quot;Fire-polished&quot; faceted beads are a less expensive alternative to hand-cut faceted glass or crystal. They derive their name from the second half of a two-part process: first, the glass batch is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, &quot;polishing&quot; out any minor surface irregularities from the grinding wheel.

==== Specialized glass techniques and types ====
[[Image:Dichroicclose.jpg|thumb|upright|Dichroic beads ({{convert|10|mm}})]]
[[Image:Furnaceglass.jpg|thumb|Furnace glass beads]]
There are several specialized glassworking techniques that create a distinctive appearance throughout the body of the resulting beads, which are then primarily referred to by the glass type.

If the glass batch is used to create a large massive block instead of pre-shaping it as it cools, the result may then be carved into smaller items in the same manner as stone. Conversely, glass artisans may make beads by [[lampworking]] the glass on an individual basis; once formed, the beads undergo little or no further shaping after the layers have been properly [[annealing (glass)|anneal]]ed.

Most of these glass subtypes are some form of [[fused glass]], although [[Goldstone (gemstone)|goldstone]] is created by controlling the reductive atmosphere and cooling conditions of the glass batch rather than by fusing separate components together.

[[Dichroic glass]] beads incorporate a semitransparent microlayer of metal between two or more layers. [[Fibre optic]] glass beads have an eyecatching [[chatoyant]] effect across the grain.

There are also several ways to fuse many small glass canes together into a multicolored pattern, resulting in [[millefiori]] beads or [[chevron bead]]s (sometimes called &quot;trade beads&quot;). &quot;Furnace glass&quot; beads encase a multicolored core in a transparent exterior layer which is then annealed in a furnace.

More economically, millefiori beads can also be made by limiting the patterning process to long, narrow canes or rods known as murrine. Thin cross-sections, or &quot;decals&quot;, can then be cut from the murrine and fused into the surface of a plain glass bead.

== Shapes ==

'''Round'''

This is the most common shape of beads that are strung on wire to create necklaces, and bracelets. The shape of the round beads lay together and are pleasing to the eye. Rounds beads can be made of glass, stone, ceramic, metal, or wood.

'''Square or Cubed'''

Square beads can be to enhance a necklace design as a spacer however a necklace can be strung with just square beads. The necklaces with square beads are used in [[Rosary]] necklaces/prayer necklaces, and wooden or shell ones are made for beachwear.

'''Oval'''

'''Tube'''

'''Potato'''
'''Hair pipe beads'''
Elk rib bones were the original material for the long, tubular [[hair pipe]] beads.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 43, 44&lt;/ref&gt; Today these beads are commonly made of [[bison]] and [[water buffalo]] bones and are popular for breastplates and chokers among [[Plains Indians]]. Black variations of these beads are made from the animals' horns.

'''Seed beads'''
{{Main|Seed bead}}
Seed beads are uniformly shaped spheroidal or tube shaped beads ranging in size from under a millimetre to several millimetres. &quot;Seed bead&quot; is a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for [[Bead weaving|loom]] and [[Bead weaving|off-loom]] bead weaving.

== Place or period of origin ==
[[Image:Cinnabarbead.jpg|thumb|right|Carved [[Cinnabar]] [[lacquer]] beads]]
'''African trade beads''' or '''[[slave beads]]''' may be antique beads that were manufactured in Europe and used for trade during the colonial period, such as chevron beads; or they may have been made in West Africa by and for Africans, such as Mauritanian [[Kiffa beads]], Ghanaian and Nigerian [[powder glass beads]], or African-made brass beads.

'''Austrian crystal''' is a generic term for cut lead-crystal beads, based on the location and prestige of the [[Swarovski]] firm.

'''Czech glass''' beads are made in the [[Czech Republic]], in particular an area called [[Jablonec nad Nisou]]. Production of glass beads in the area dates back to the 14th century, though production was depressed under communist rule. Because of this long tradition, their workmanship and quality has an excellent reputation.

'''Vintage beads''', in the collectibles and antique market, refers to items that are at least 25 or more years old. Vintage beads are available in materials that include lucite, plastic, crystal, metal and glass.

=== Miscellaneous ethnic beads ===
[[Tibet]]an [[Dzi bead]]s and [[Rudraksha bead]]s are used to make Buddhist and Hindu rosaries ([[Prayer beads|malas]]). [[Magatama]] are traditional [[Japan]]ese beads, and [[cinnabar]] was often used for making beads&lt;!--It would be good to add the name of these beads.--&gt; in [[China]]. [[Wampum]] are cylindrical white or purple beads made from [[quahog]] or North Atlantic [[channeled whelk]] shells by northeastern Native American tribes, such as the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] and [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Job's tears]] are seed beads popular among southeastern Native American tribes. [[Heishe]] are beads made of shells or stones by the [[Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico|Kewa Pueblo people]] of [[New Mexico]].

==Symbolic meaning of beads==
In many parts of the world, beads are used for symbolic purposes, for example:
* [[Prayer beads|use for prayer or devotion]] - e.g. [[rosary beads]] for Roman Catholics, [[misbaha]] for Muslims, [[japamala]]/[[Buddhist prayer beads]]/nenju for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, some Sikhs, [[Confucianism]], [[Tao]]ists/[[Dao]]ists, [[Shinto]], etc.
* use for anti-tension devices, e.g. [[worry beads]]
* use as currency e.g. [[Aggrey beads]] from [[Ghana]]
* use for gaming e.g. [[owari beads]] for [[mankala]]
* Greek [[komboloi]] beads as in [[Crete]]

==History==
Beads are thought to be one of the earliest forms of trade between members of the human race. It is thought that bead trading was one of the reasons why humans developed language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagel|first1=Mark|title=Why We Speak|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/why-humans-speak-language-origins/396635/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beads are said to have been used and traded for most of our history. The oldest beads found to date were at [[Blombos Cave]], about 72,000 years old, and at [[Ksar Akil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dating of beads sets new timeline for early humans|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2013-09-12-dating-beads-sets-new-timeline-early-humans|website=University of Oxford|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lebanon, about 40,000 years old.

==Surface patterns==
After shaping, glass and crystal beads can have their surface appearance enhanced by etching a translucent frosted layer, applying an additional colour layer, or both. ''Aurora Borealis'', or AB, is a surface coating that diffuses light into a rainbow. Other surface coatings are vitrail, moonlight, dorado, satin, star shine, and heliotrope.

Faux beads are beads that are made to look like a more expensive original material, especially in the case of fake [[pearl]]s and simulated rocks, [[minerals]] and [[gemstone]]s. Precious metals and [[ivory]] are also imitated.

[[Tagua nut]]s from South America are used as an ivory substitute since the natural [[ivory trade]] has been restricted worldwide.
