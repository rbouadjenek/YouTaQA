'''Birds''' are a group of [[warm-blooded]] [[vertebrate]]s constituting the [[class (biology)|class]] '''Aves''', characterized by [[feather]]s, toothless beaked jaws, the [[Oviparity|laying]] of [[Eggshell|hard-shelled]] eggs, a high [[Metabolism|metabolic]] rate, a four-chambered [[heart]], and a strong yet lightweight [[Bird skeleton|skeleton]]. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[bee hummingbird]] to the {{convert|2.75|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Common ostrich|ostrich]]. There are about ten thousand living species,&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, D.1998 ''The Life of Birds''. BBC books. {{ISBN|0563 38792 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than half of which are [[passerine]], or &quot;perching&quot; birds. Birds have {{Birdgloss|wings}} whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct [[moa]] and [[elephant bird]]s. Wings, which evolved from [[forelimb]]s, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including [[ratite]]s, [[penguin]]s, and diverse [[endemism|endemic]] island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly [[seabird]]s and some [[Water bird|waterbirds]], have further evolved for swimming.

Birds are a group of [[feathered dinosaur|feathered]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s, and constitute the [[Origin of birds|only living dinosaurs]]. Likewise, the closest living relatives of birds are the [[crocodilia]]ns. Birds are descendants of the primitive [[aviala]]ns (whose members include ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'') which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds ('''Neornithes''') evolved in the [[Middle Cretaceous|Middle]] to [[Late Cretaceous]], and diversified dramatically around the time of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 mya, which killed off the [[pterosaur]]s and all non-avian dinosaurs.

Some birds, especially [[corvids]] and [[parrot]]s, are among the most intelligent animals; several bird species [[tool use by animals|make and use tools]], with certain birds' use of tools rivaling the best performances of [[primate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[social animal|social species]] pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered [[Animal_culture#Examples_of_culturally_transmitted_behaviors_in_birds|a form of culture]]. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and [[bird vocalization|songs]], and participating in such behaviours as [[helpers at the nest|cooperative breeding]] and hunting, [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], and [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]], usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] (one male with many females) or, rarely, [[Polyandry in nature|polyandrous]] (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through [[sexual reproduction]]. They are usually laid in a nest and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.

Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with [[Poultry|domesticated]] and [[Game (hunting)|undomesticated]] birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. [[Songbird]]s, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. [[Guano]] (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become [[Bird extinction|extinct]] due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational [[birdwatching]] is an important part of the [[ecotourism]] industry.

===Definition===
Aves and a sister group, the order [[Crocodilia]], contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade [[Archosauria]]. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] as all descendants of the [[most recent common ancestor]] of modern birds and ''[[Archaeopteryx|Archaeopteryx lithographica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Padian|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Padian|author2=L.M. Chiappe |author3=Chiappe LM |editor=[[Philip J. Currie]] |editor2=Kevin Padian |title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs|year=1997|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego|pages=41–96|chapter=Bird Origins|isbn=0-12-226810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an earlier definition proposed by [[Jacques Gauthier]] gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the [[Phylocode]] system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the [[crown group]] of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from [[fossils]], and assigning them, instead, to the Avialae,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gauthier |first=Jacques|editor=Kevin Padian |title=The Origin of Birds and the Evolution of Flight|series= Memoirs of the California Academy of Science '''8'''|year=1986|pages=1–55|chapter=Saurischian Monophyly and the origin of birds|isbn=0-940228-14-9 |publisher=Published by California Academy of Sciences |location=San Francisco, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of ''Archaeopteryx'' in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.&lt;!-- See WP:RS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phylonames.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;!--Mayr et al. 2005 &quot;A well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features&quot; + comment + Mayr's comment on the comment--&gt;

Gauthier&lt;ref name=&quot;gauthier&amp;dequeiroz2001&quot;/&gt; identified four different definitions for the same biological name &quot;Aves&quot;, which is a problem. Gauthier proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants, which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. He assigned other names to the other groups.

# Aves can mean all [[archosaur]]s closer to birds than to [[crocodile]]s (alternately [[Avemetatarsalia]])
# Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternately [[Avifilopluma]])
# Aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly (alternately [[Avialae]])
# Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a &quot;crown group&quot;, in this sense synonymous with '''Neornithes''')

Under the fourth definition ''Archaeopteryx'' is an avialan, and not a member of Aves. Gauthier's proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and [[bird evolution]], though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term &quot;bird&quot; by these researchers.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Pascal Godefroit |author2=Andrea Cau |author3=Hu Dong-Yu |author4=François Escuillié |author5=Wu Wenhao |author6=Gareth Dyke |year=2013 |title=A Jurassic avialan dinosaur from China resolves the early phylogenetic history of birds |journal=Nature |volume= 498|issue= 7454|pages= 359–362|doi=10.1038/nature12168 |pmid=23719374|bibcode=2013Natur.498..359G|author1-link=Pascal Godefroit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many authors have used a definition similar to &quot;all [[theropod]]s closer to birds than to ''[[Deinonychus]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;weishampel2004&quot;&gt;Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; Osmólska, Halszka (eds.)

The consensus view in contemporary [[paleontology|palaeontology]] is that the flying theropods, or [[Avialae|avialans]], are the closest relatives of the [[deinonychosaur]]s, which include dromaeosaurids and [[troodontid]]s.&lt;ref name=Xiaotingia&gt;{{cite journal |title=An ''Archaeopteryx''-like theropod from China and the origin of Avialae |date=28 July 2011 |journal=Nature |volume=475 |pages=465–470 |doi=10.1038/nature10288 |issue=7357 |author1=Xing Xu |author2=Hailu You |author3=Kai Du |author4=Fenglu Han |pmid=21796204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these form a group called [[Paraves]].

The [[Late Jurassic]] ''Archaeopteryx'' is well known as one of the first [[transitional fossil]]s to be found, and it provided support for the [[theory of evolution]] in the late 19th century. ''Archaeopteryx'' was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics—teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail—as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayretal2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2006.00245.x | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | last2 = Pohl | first2 = B. | last3 = Hartman | first3 = S. | last4 = Peters | first4 = D.S. | date = January 2007 | title = The tenth skeletal specimen of ''Archaeopteryx''| journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 149 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known avialan fossils come from the [[Tiaojishan Formation]] of China, which has been dated to the late [[Jurassic]] period ([[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] stage), about 160 million years ago. The avialan species from this time period include ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', ''[[Xiaotingia zhengi]]'', and ''[[Aurornis xui]]''.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

The well-known early avialan, ''Archaeopteryx'', dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from [[Germany]]. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or &quot;hind wings&quot; covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.&lt;ref name=zhengetal2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zheng | first1 = X. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z. | last3 = Wang | first3 = X. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = F. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = X. | last6 = Wang | first6 = Y. | last7 = Wei | first7 = G. | last8 = Wang | first8 = S. | last9 = Xu | first9 = X. | date = 15 March 2013 | title = Hind Wings in Basal Birds and the Evolution of Leg Feathers | journal = Science | volume = 339 | issue = 6125| pages = 1309–1312 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228753 | pmid=23493711| citeseerx = 10.1.1.1031.5732 | bibcode = 2013Sci...339.1309Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the [[enantiornithes]], or &quot;opposite birds&quot;, so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of [[Ecological niche|ecological niches]], from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period, enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the [[Mesozoic era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt;

Many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify, the [[Euornithes]] (meaning &quot;true birds&quot;, because they include the ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked [[Perching bird|perching]] adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species, waders, and swimming and diving species.

The latter included the superficially [[gull]]-like ''[[Ichthyornis]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke |first=Julia A.|year=2004 |title=Morphology, Phylogenetic Taxonomy, and Systematics of ''Ichthyornis'' and ''Apatornis'' (Avialae: Ornithurae) |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=286 |pages=1–179 |doi= 10.1206/0003-0090(2004)286&lt;0001:MPTASO&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/454/1/B286.pdf|hdl=2246/454}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hesperornithiformes]], which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).&lt;ref name=louchart2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Louchart | first1 = A. | last2 = Viriot | first2 = L. | year = 2011 | title = From snout to beak: the loss of teeth in birds | url = http://198.81.200.84/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347%2811%2900264-3?switch=standard | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 663–673 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2011.09.004 | pmid = 21978465 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140728053547/http://198.81.200.84/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347%2811%2900264-3?switch=standard | archivedate = 28 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true [[pygostyle]] and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers,&lt;ref name=yixianornis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = F. | date = March 2006 | title = Insight into the evolution of avian flight from a new clade of Early Cretaceous ornithurines from China and the morphology of ''Yixianornis grabaui'' | url = | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 208 | issue = 3| pages = 287–308 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00534.x | pmid=16533313 | pmc=2100246}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may have replaced the &quot;hind wing&quot; as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.&lt;ref name=zhengetal2013/&gt;

The classification of birds is a contentious issue. [[Charles Sibley|Sibley]] and [[Jon Ahlquist|Ahlquist]]'s ''Phylogeny and Classification of Birds'' (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sibley |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Sibley |author2=Jon Edward Ahlquist  |year=1990 |title=Phylogeny and classification of birds |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-04085-7|author2-link=Jon Edward Ahlquist }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is frequently debated and constantly revised.

Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a [[body plan]] that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate [[bird flight|flight]].

===Skeletal system===

The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Paul R. |author2=David S.

===Excretory system===

===Respiratory and circulatory systems===

Birds have one of the most complex [[respiratory system]]s of all animal groups.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior [[Parabronchi|air sac]] which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maina |first=John N. |date=November 2006 |title=Development, structure, and function of a novel respiratory organ, the lung-air sac system of birds: to go where no other vertebrate has gone |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=545–579 |pmid=17038201 |doi=10.1017/S1464793106007111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound production is achieved using the [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea;&lt;ref name = &quot;Suthers&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suthers |first=Roderick A. |author2=Sue Anne Zollinger |pmid = 15313772 |doi=10.1196/annals.1298.041 |volume=1016 |issue=1 |title=Producing song: the vocal apparatus |date=June 2004 |journal=Ann.

In birds, the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right [[aortic arches|aortic arch]] (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the [[aorta]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system.

====Heart type and features====

[[File:Didactic model of an avian heart-FMVZ USP-13.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of an avian heart.]]
The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a [[serous fluid]] for lubrication.&lt;ref name=Whittow&gt;Whittow, G. (2000). Sturkie's Avian Physiology/ edited by G. Causey Whittow. San Diego : Academic Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by [[atrioventricular valves]] which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.

The [[sinoatrial node]] uses calcium to cause a [[Depolarization|depolarising]] [[signal transduction pathway]] from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of [[endocardial]], [[myocardial]] and [[epicardial]] layers.&lt;ref name=Whittow /&gt; The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoagstrom&quot;&gt;Hoagstrom, C.W. (2002). &quot;Vertebrate Circulation&quot;. ''Magill's Encyclopedia of Science: Animal Life''. Vol 1, pp. 217–219. Pasadena, California, Salem Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organisation====

Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to [[gas exchange]] volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoagstrom&quot; /&gt; The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular contractions, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo [[vasoconstriction]], and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;Hill, Richard W. (2012) Animal Physiology/ Richard W. Hill, Gordon A. Wyse, Margaret Anderson. Third Edition pp. 647–678. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA&lt;/ref&gt; As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.

Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds, blood flow is slowed to allow maximum [[diffusion]] of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called [[vasodilation]] bringing blood back to the heart.&lt;ref name=Hill /&gt; Once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.

===Chromosomes===

Birds have two sexes: either [[female]] or [[male]]. The sex of birds is determined by the [[ZW sex-determination system|Z and W sex chromosomes]], rather than by the [[XY sex-determination system|X and Y chromosomes]] present in [[mammal]]s. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilisation.

Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in [[Feathered dinosaurs|some dinosaurs]] not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate [[bird flight|flight]], provide insulation that aids in [[thermoregulation]], and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called [[Pterylography|pterylae]]. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called [[plumage]], may vary within species by age, [[social status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belthoff |first=James R. |date=1 August 1994|title=Plumage Variation, Plasma Steroids and Social Dominance in Male House Finches |journal=The Condor |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=614–625 |doi=10.2307/1369464 |author2=Dufty |author3=Gauthreaux|url=http://works.bepress.com/james_belthoff/29 |jstor=1369464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual dimorphism|sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guthrie| first=R.

Plumage is regularly [[moult]]ed; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the &quot;{{Birdgloss|basic plumage|non-breeding}}&quot; plumage, or—in the [[Humphrey–Parkes terminology]]—&quot;basic&quot; plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey–Parkes system as &quot;{{Birdgloss|alternate plumage|alternate}}&quot; plumages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphrey |first=Philip S. |date=1 June 1959|title=An approach to the study of molts and plumages |journal=The Auk |volume=76 |pages=1–31 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v076n01/p0001-p0031.pdf |issue=1 |jstor=4081839|last2=Parkes|first2=K.C.|doi=10.2307/4081839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moulting is annual in most species, although [[Glossary of bird terms#cite note-32|some]] may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, [[flight feather]]s are replaced one at a time with the innermost {{Birdgloss|primary}} being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost {{Birdgloss|tertiaries}} begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the {{Birdgloss|secondaries}} starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary {{Birdgloss|coverts}} are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.&lt;ref name=&quot;pettingill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pettingill Jr. OS|year=1970|title=Ornithology in Laboratory and Field|isbn=0-12-552455-2|publisher=Burgess Publishing Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bird anatomy#Scales|scales]] of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs.

Most birds can [[Flying and gliding animals|fly]], which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb ([[wing]]) that serves as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

===Water and drinking===
Water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of [[sweat gland]]s reduces the physiological demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2005|url=http://irs.ub.rug.nl/ppn/287916626|isbn=90-367-2378-7|last=Engel|first=Sophia Barbara|title=Racing the wind: Water economy and energy expenditure in avian endurance flight|publisher=University of Groningen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The role of hyperthermia in the water economy of desert birds|journal= Physiol.

Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the [[Columbidae|pigeon]], [[Estrildidae|finch]], [[Coliidae|mousebird]], [[Turnicidae|button-quail]] and [[Otididae|bustard]] families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sara L.|last=Hallager|title=Drinking methods in two species of bustards|journal=Wilson Bull.|volume=106|issue=4|year=1994|pages=763–764|hdl=10088/4338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some desert birds depend on water sources and [[sandgrouse]] are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes.

===Feather care===
Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, [[ectoparasitic]] feather mites and [[Bird louse|bird lice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The alterations of plumage of parasitic origin|first1=Principato|last1=Mario|first2=Lisi|last2=Federica|first3=Moretta|last3=Iolanda|first4=Samra|last4=Nada|first5=Puccetti|last5=Francesco|journal=Italian Journal of Animal Science|url=http://ijas.pagepress.org/index.php/ijas/article/download/ijas.2005.296/610|volume=4|issue=3|pages=296–299|year=2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617234727/http://ijas.pagepress.org/index.php/ijas/article/download/ijas.2005.296/610|archivedate=17 June 2013|df=dmy-all|doi=10.4081/ijas.2005.296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical condition of feathers are maintained by {{Birdgloss|preening}} often with the application of secretions from the {{Birdgloss|preen gland}}. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]] in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Auk |volume=121|issue=4|pages=1262–1268| year=2004| doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[1262:BAFAOA]2.0.CO;2| title=Bactericidal and fungicidal activity of ant chemicals on feather parasites: an evaluation of anting behavior as a method of self-medication in songbirds| first1=Hannah C. |last1=Revis|first2=Deborah A. |last2=Waller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Open Ornithology Journal|year=2010|volume=3|pages=41–71|doi=10.2174/1874453201003010041|title=How Birds Combat Ectoparasites|first1=Dale H.|last1=Clayton|first2=Jennifer A.H.|last2=Koop|first3=Christopher W.|last3=Harbison|first4=Brett R.|last4=Moyer|first5=Sarah E.|last5=Bush|url=http://darwin.biology.utah.edu/PubsHTML/PDF-Files/Bush24.pdf|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153758/http://darwin.biology.utah.edu/pubshtml/PDF-Files/Bush24.pdf|archive-date=11 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration===
{{Main|Bird migration}}
[[File:CanadianGeeseFlyingInVFormation.jpg|thumb|A flock of [[Canada geese]] in [[V formation]]]]
Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of [[season]]al temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, [[shorebird]]s, and [[waterbird]]s undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the [[temperate]] or [[polar region]]s and a non-breeding season in the [[tropical]] regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Battley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Klaassen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaassen |first=Marc |date=1 January 1996|title=Metabolic constraints on long-distance migration in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=57–64 |pmid=9317335 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around {{convert|2500|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} and shorebirds can fly up to {{convert|4000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gill |first=Frank |year=1995 |title=Ornithology |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=W.H.

[[Albatross]]es nesting in the [[Southern Ocean]] often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croxall |first=John P. |year=2005 |title=Global Circumnavigations: Tracking year-round ranges of nonbreeding Albatrosses |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5707 |pages=249–250 |doi=10.1126/science.1106042 |pmid=15653503 |last2=Silk |first2=JR |last3=Phillips |first3=RA |last4=Afanasyev |first4=V |last5=Briggs |first5=DR|bibcode=2005Sci...307..249C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. [[wikt:irruptive|Irruptive]] species such as the boreal [[finch]]es are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson |first=W.

[[Altitudinal migration]] is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when [[territory (animal)|the normal territories]] also become inhospitable due to lack of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabenold |first=Kerry N. |year=1985 |title=Variation in Altitudinal Migration, Winter Segregation, and Site Tenacity in two subspecies of Dark-eyed Juncos in the southern Appalachians |journal=The Auk |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=805–819 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v102n04/p0805-p0819.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. [[True parrots|Parrots]] as a [[family (biology)|family]] are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collar |first=Nigel J. |year=1997 |chapter=Family Psittacidae (Parrots) |title=Handbook of the Birds of the World |volume=4: Sandgrouse to Cuckoos |editor=Josep del Hoyo |editor2=Andrew Elliott |editor3=Jordi Sargatal |location=Barcelona |publisher=Lynx Edicions |isbn=84-87334-22-9|title-link=Handbook of the Birds of the World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s, a [[Manx shearwater]] released in [[Boston]] in the United States returned to its colony in [[Skomer]], in Wales within 13 days, a distance of {{convert|5150|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews |first=G.V.T. |date=1 September 1953|title=Navigation in the Manx Shearwater |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=370–396 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/30/3/370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] migrants, the [[sun]] is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an [[Chronobiology|internal clock]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the [[constellation]]s surrounding [[Polaris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouritsen |first=Henrik |date=15 November 2001|title=Migrating songbirds tested in computer-controlled Emlen funnels use stellar cues for a time-independent compass |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=204 |issue=8 |pages=3855–3865 |pmid= 11807103 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/204/22/3855 |author2=L}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's [[geomagnetism]] through specialised [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutschlander |first=Mark E. |date=15 April 1999|title=The case for light-dependent magnetic orientation in animals |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=202 |issue=8 |pages=891–908 |pmid= 10085262 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/202/8/891 |author2=P |author3=B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Möller |first=Anders Pape |year=1988 |title=Badge size in the house sparrow ''Passer domesticus''|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=373–378 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226147226 |doi=10.1007/BF00295107|doi-broken-date=2019-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the [[sunbittern]]'s mimicry of a large predator to ward off [[hawk]]s and protect young chicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas |first=Betsy Trent |date=1 August 1990 |title=Nesting Behavior of Sunbitterns (''Eurypyga helias'') in Venezuela |journal=The Condor |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=576–581 |doi=10.2307/1368675 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v092n03/p0576-p0581.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305194240/http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v092n03/p0576-p0581.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 |author2=Strahl |url-status=dead |df=dmy |jstor=1368675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.

Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where &quot;dances&quot; are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering |first=S.P.C. |year=2001 |title=Courtship behaviour of the Wandering Albatross ''Diomedea exulans'' at Bird Island, South Georgia |journal=Marine Ornithology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |url=http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/29_1/29_1_6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pruett-Jones |first=S.G. |date=1 May 1990|title=Sexual Selection Through Female Choice in Lawes' Parotia, A Lek-Mating Bird of Paradise |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=486–501 |doi=10.2307/2409431 |author2=Pruett-Jones|jstor=2409431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bird vocalization|Bird calls and songs]], which are produced in the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], are the major means by which birds communicate with [[sound]].

While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large [[flock (birds)|flocks]]. The principal benefits of flocking are [[safety in numbers]] and increased foraging efficiency.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where [[ambush predation]] is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many [[mixed-species feeding flock]]s, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terborgh |first=John |year=2005 |title=Mixed flocks and polyspecific associations: Costs and benefits of mixed groups to birds and monkeys |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=21 |issue=2|pages=87–100 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350210203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutto |first=Richard L. |date=January 1988|title=Foraging Behavior Patterns Suggest a Possible Cost Associated with Participation in Mixed-Species Bird Flocks |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=79–83 |doi=10.2307/3565809 |jstor=3565809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening &quot;peeks&quot;, allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gauthier-Clerc |first=Michael |year=2000 |title=Sleep-Vigilance Trade-off in Gadwall during the Winter Period |journal=The Condor |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=307–313 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v102n02/p0307-p0313.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227194439/http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v102n02/p0307-p0313.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2004 |doi=10.1650/0010-5422(2000)102[0307:SVTOIG]2.0.CO;2|last2=Tamisier |first2=Alain |last3=Cézilly |first3=Frank|jstor=1369642}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swift]]s are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=205|pages=905–910|date=1 April 2002|title=Harmonic oscillatory orientation relative to the wind in nocturnal roosting flights of the swift ''Apus apus''|first=Johan|last=Bäckman|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/205/7/905|pmid=11916987|issue=7|author2=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rattenborg|first=Niels C. |year=2006 |title=Do birds sleep in flight? |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=93 |issue=9 |pages=413–425 |doi=10.1007/s00114-006-0120-3|pmid=16688436|bibcode=2006NW.....93..413R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into [[slow-wave sleep]] one [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for [[predator]]s by viewing the outer margins of the flock.

Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their [[beak|bills]] in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. [[Passerine|Perching birds]] have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.

====Territories, nesting and incubation====
{{See also|Bird nest}}
Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as [[seabird]]s and [[swift]]s, often breed in [[Bird colony|colonies]] instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H | last2 = Harris | first2 = M | last3 = Wanless | first3 = S | year = 2004 | title = Competition for breeding sites and site-dependent population regulation in a highly colonial seabird, the common guillemot ''Uria aalge'' | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 367–376 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00813.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All birds lay [[amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay [[camouflage]]d eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting [[nightjar]]s have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of [[brood parasites]] have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booker | first1 = L | last2 = Booker | first2 = M | year = 1991 | title = Why Are Cuckoos Host Specific? | journal = [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 301–309 | doi = 10.2307/3565958 | jstor=3565958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Golden-backed Weaver.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Yellow weaver (bird) with black head hangs an upside-down nest woven out of grass fronds.|Male [[golden-backed weaver]]s construct elaborate suspended nests out of grass.]]
Bird eggs are usually laid in a [[Bird nest|nest]]. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hansell&quot;&gt;Hansell M (2000). ''Bird Nests and Construction Behaviour''. University of Cambridge Press {{ISBN|0-521-46038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; [[albatross]] nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests.

[[Egg incubation|Incubation]], which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through [[brood patch]]es, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as {{convert|83|g}} of body weight per day of incubation.&lt;ref&gt;Warham, J.

====Parental care and fledging====
{{Main|Parental care in birds}}
At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed ''[[altricial]]'', and tend to be born small, [[Blindness|blind]], immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed ''[[precocial]]''. Altricial chicks need help [[thermoregulation|thermoregulating]] and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. The young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an &quot;altricial-precocial spectrum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urfi2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Urfi|first=A.J.|title=The Painted Stork: Ecology and Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9tczTapYXMC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-8468-5|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicks at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed {{Birdgloss|semi-precocial}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Khanna2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Khanna|first=D.R.|title=Biology of Birds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDblIChi7KwC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2005|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7141-933-3|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{Birdgloss|semi-altricial}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Lynnette|title=Wildlife Rehabilitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpAOAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association|isbn=978-1-931439-23-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in [[megapode]]s ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot A (1994). &quot;Family Megapodiidae (Megapodes)&quot; in ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]. Volume 2; New World Vultures to Guineafowl'' (eds del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J)  Lynx Edicions:Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-87334-15-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the [[great frigatebird]], whose chicks take up to six months to [[fledge]] and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.&lt;ref&gt;Metz VG, Schreiber EA (2002). &quot;Great Frigatebird (''Fregata minor'')&quot; In ''The Birds of North America, No 681'', (Poole, A. and Gill, F., eds) The Birds of North America Inc: Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chick guard stage'' describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Euan. ''Skua and Penguin. Predator and Prey.''. Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, [[helpers at the nest|other members]] of the same species—usually close relatives of the [[breeding pair]], such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Family living amongst birds |  journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 289–298 | doi = 10.1111/j.2006.0908-8857.03666.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such alloparenting is particularly common among the [[Corvida]], which includes such birds as the true [[Corvidae|crows]], [[Australian magpie]] and [[fairy-wren]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cockburn A|veditors=Floyd R, Sheppard A, de Barro P |title=Frontiers in Population Ecology|year=1996|publisher=CSIRO|location=Melbourne|pages=21–42|chapter=Why do so many Australian birds cooperate? Social evolution in the Corvida}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been observed in species as different as the [[Rifleman (bird)|rifleman]] and [[red kite]]. Among most groups of animals, [[Paternal care|male parental care]] is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Although territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a [[division of labour]] in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3458|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|volume=273|issue=1592|pages=1375–1383|pmid=16777726|pmc=1560291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which chicks [[fledge]] varies dramatically. The chicks of the ''[[Synthliboramphus]]'' murrelets, like the [[ancient murrelet]], leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston AJ (1994). Ancient Murrelet (''Synthliboramphus antiquus''). In ''The Birds of North America, No. 132'' (A. Poole and F. Gill, Eds.). Philadelphia: The Academy of Natural Sciences; Washington, D.C.: The American Ornithologists' Union.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = HC | last2 = Eshiamwata | first2 = GW | last3 = Munyekenye | first3 = FB | last4 = Böhning-Gaese | first4 = K | year = 2004 | title = Life-history of two African ''Sylvia'' warblers: low annual fecundity and long post-fledging care |  journal = [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] | volume = 146 | issue = 3| pages = 427–437 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicks may also follow their parents during their first [[bird migration|migration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = JC | last2 = Bautista | first2 = LM | last3 = Alonso | first3 = JA | year = 2004 | title = Family-based territoriality vs flocking in wintering common cranes ''Grus grus'' |  journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 434–444 | doi = 10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03290.x | hdl = 10261/43767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brood parasites====
{{Main|Brood parasite}}
[[File:Reed warbler cuckoo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Small brown bird places an insect in the bill of much larger grey bird in nest|[[Reed warbler]] raising a [[common cuckoo]], a [[brood parasite]].]]
[[Brood parasitism]], in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.&lt;ref name = &quot;brood&quot;&gt;Davies N (2000). ''Cuckoos, Cowbirds and other Cheats''. [[T. &amp; A. D. Poyser]]: London {{ISBN|0-85661-135-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either ''obligate brood parasites'', which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or ''non-obligate brood parasites'', which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of [[conspecific]]s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/beheco/8.2.153 | last1 = Sorenson | first1 = M | year = 1997 | title = Effects of intra- and interspecific brood parasitism on a precocial host, the canvasback, ''Aythya valisineria'' | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 153–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred bird species, including [[honeyguide]]s, [[icterid]]s, and [[Black-headed duck|ducks]], are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the [[cuckoo]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;brood&quot;/&gt; Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Spottiswoode| first1=C.N.| last2=Colebrook-Robjent| first2=J.F.R.| title=Egg puncturing by the brood parasitic Greater Honeyguide and potential host counteradaptations| journal=Behavioral Ecology| volume=18| pages=792–799| year=2007| doi=10.1093/beheco/arm025| issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual selection====
[[File:Peacock Flying.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a [[Fisherian runaway]]]]
{{main|Sexual selection in birds}}
Birds have [[evolution|evolved]] a variety of [[mating]] behaviours, with the [[peafowl|peacock]] tail being perhaps the most famous example of [[sexual selection]] and the [[Fisherian runaway]]. Commonly occurring [[sexual dimorphism]]s such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations.&lt;ref name=edwards2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=DB|title=Immune investment is explained by sexual selection and pace-of-life, but not longevity in parrots (Psittaciformes).|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e53066|pmid=23300862|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053066|pmc=3531452|bibcode=2012PLoSO...753066E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of avian [[sexual selection]] have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate. Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual's fitness. Conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and [[courtship behavior|courtship behaviour]] are &quot;honest&quot; traits. Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours.&lt;ref name=doutrelant2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doutrelant|first=C|author2=Grégoire, A |author3=Midamegbe, A |author4=Lambrechts, M |author5= Perret, P |title=Female plumage coloration is sensitive to the cost of reproduction.

====Inbreeding avoidance====
{{main|Inbreeding avoidance}}
Incestuous matings by the [[Purple-crowned fairywren|purple-crowned fairy wren]] ''Malurus coronatus'' result in severe fitness costs due to [[inbreeding depression]] (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs).&lt;ref name=Kingma&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kingma | first1 = SA | last2 = Hall | first2 = ML | last3 = Peters | first3 = A | year = 2013 | title = Breeding synchronization facilitates extrapair mating for inbreeding avoidance | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 1390–1397 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/art078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see [[Promiscuity#Other animals]] for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding. However, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings. Nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young.&lt;ref name=Kingma /&gt;

Inbreeding depression occurs in the [[great tit]] (''Parus major'') when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of ''Parus major'', inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18211876&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szulkin M, Sheldon BC |title=Dispersal as a means of inbreeding avoidance in a wild bird population |journal=Proc.

[[Southern pied babbler]]s ''Turdoides bicolor'' appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways. The first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22471769&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson-Flower MJ, Hockey PA, O'Ryan C, Ridley AR |title=Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms: dispersal dynamics in cooperatively breeding southern pied babblers |journal=J Anim Ecol |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=876–883 |year=2012 |pmid=22471769 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01983.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although both males and females disperse locally, they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered. Within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated.

[[File:Pinzón azul de Gran Canaria (macho), M. A. Peña.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gran Canaria blue chaffinch]], an example of a bird highly specialised in its habitat, in this case in the [[Pinus canariensis|Canarian pine]] forests.]]
Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.&lt;ref name = &quot;flycatcher&quot;/&gt; While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the [[Ecological niche|niches]] occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the [[forest canopy]], others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be [[insectivore]]s, [[frugivore]]s, and [[nectarivore]]s. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or [[kleptoparasitism]]. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised [[scavenger]]s. [[Avivore]]s are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.

Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal.&lt;ref name = &quot;Clout&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clout | first1 = M | last2 = Hay | first2 = J | year = 1989 | title = The importance of birds as browsers, pollinators and seed dispersers in New Zealand forests | url = http://www.newzealandecology.org/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol12_s_27.pdf | journal = New Zealand Journal of Ecology | volume = 12 | pages = 27–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and pollinating birds often [[coevolution|coevolve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gary Stiles | first1=F. | title=Geographical Aspects of Bird-Flower Coevolution, with Particular Reference to Central America | journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume=68 | issue=2 | pages=323–351 | year=1981 |doi= 10.2307/2398801 | jstor=2398801}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Temeles | first1 = E | last2 = Linhart | first2 = Y | last3 = Masonjones | first3 = M | last4 = Masonjones | first4 = H | year = 2002 | title = The Role of Flower Width in Hummingbird Bill Length–Flower Length Relationships | url = http://www.amherst.edu/~ejtemeles/Temeles%20et%20al%202002%20biotropica.pdf | journal = Biotropica | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 68–80 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2002.tb00243.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand nine species of [[moa]] were important browsers, as are the [[kererū]] and [[kokako]] today.&lt;ref name = &quot;Clout&quot;/&gt; Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bond | first1=William J. | last2=Lee | first2=William G. | last3=Craine | first3=Joseph M. | title=Plant structural defences against browsing birds: a legacy of New Zealand's extinct moas | journal=Oikos | volume=104 | pages=500–508 | year=2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12720.x | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nesting [[seabird]]s may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of [[guano]], which may enrich the local soil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainright | first1 = S | last2 = Haney | first2 = J | last3 = Kerr | first3 = C | last4 = Golovkin | first4 = A | last5 = Flint | first5 = M | year = 1998 | title = Utilization of nitrogen derived from seabird guano by terrestrial and marine plants at St. Paul, Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska | journal = Marine Ecology | volume = 131 | issue = 1| pages = 63–71 | doi=10.1007/s002270050297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surrounding seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3354/meps032247 | last1 = Bosman | first1 = A | last2 = Hockey | first2 = A | year = 1986 | title = Seabird guano as a determinant of rocky intertidal community structure | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 32 |pages = 247–257 | bibcode = 1986MEPS...32..247B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as [[psittacosis]], [[salmonellosis]], [[campylobacteriosis]], mycobacteriosis (avian [[tuberculosis]]), [[avian influenza]] (bird flu), [[giardiasis]], and [[cryptosporidiosis]] over long distances.

Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called [[poultry]], are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, {{Nowrap|76 million}} tons of poultry and {{Nowrap|61 million}} tons of eggs were produced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown|first1=Lester|title=Outgrowing the Earth: The Food Security Challenge in an Age of Falling Water Tables and Rising Temperatures |chapter-url=http://www.earth-policy.org/datacenter/xls/book_ote_ch3_2.xls|year=2005|publisher=earthscan |isbn=978-1-84407-185-2|chapter=3: Moving Up the Food Chain Efficiently. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicken]]s account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated [[domesticated turkey|turkeys]], [[domestic duck|ducks]], and [[domestic goose|geese]] are also relatively common. Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include [[pheasant]]s, [[wild turkey]]s, quail, [[dove]]s, [[partridge]], [[grouse]], [[snipe]], and [[woodcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Simeone | first1=A. | last2=Navarro | first2=X. | year=2002 | title=Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene | journal=Rev.

Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the [[Down feather|down]] of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces ([[guano]]), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The [[War of the Pacific]], sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/19cen/guanowar.html|title=The Guano War of 1865–1866|publisher=World History at KMLA|accessdate=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as [[Parrot (family)|parrots]] and [[myna]]s, are bred in [[aviculture|captivity]] or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0030605306000056 | last1=Cooney | first1=R. | last2=Jepson | first2=P | year=2006 | title=The international wild bird trade: what's wrong with blanket bans? | journal=Oryx | volume=40 | issue=1| pages=18–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falcon]]s and [[cormorant]]s have long been used for [[Falconry|hunting]] and [[Cormorant fishing|fishing]], respectively.

Birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology.
In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a [[deity]], such as in the Cult of [[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]], in which the [[Tangata manu]] of [[Easter Island]] served as chiefs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Routledge | first1=S. | last2=Routledge | first2=K. | year=1917 | title=The Bird Cult of Easter Island |  journal=Folklore | volume=28 | issue=4| pages=337–355 | doi=10.1080/0015587X.1917.9719006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as attendants, as in the case of [[Hugin and Munin]], the two [[common raven]]s who whispered news into the ears of the [[Norse god]] [[Odin]]. In several civilisations of [[History of Italy|ancient Italy]], particularly [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Religion in Ancient Rome|religion]], priests were involved in [[augur]]y, or interpreting the words of birds while the &quot;auspex&quot; (from which the word &quot;auspicious&quot; is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, Ernest (1923).

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California condor]] and [[Norfolk parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1=Butchart | first1=S. | last2=Stattersfield | first2=A. | last3=Collar | first3=N | year=2006 | title=How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal=Oryx | volume=40 | issue=3| pages=266–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
