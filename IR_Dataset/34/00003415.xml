'''Bulgaria''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bulgaria.ogg|b|ʌ|l|ˈ|ɡ|ɛər|i|ə|,_|b|ʊ|l|-}}; {{lang-bg|България|Balgariya}}), officially the '''Republic of Bulgaria''' ({{lang-bg|Република България|links=no|Republika Balgariya}}, {{IPA-bg|rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ|IPA}}), is a country in [[Southeast Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The capital and largest city is [[Sofia]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]]. With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2}}, Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|16th-largest country]].

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[ancient Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire]] lost some of these territories to an invading [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries.

The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|one-party socialist state]] and part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[multi-party]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy.

Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the [[sovereign state]] has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million resides mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the [[Provinces of Bulgaria|27 provinces]]. The population has declined since the late 1980s.

Bulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the [[UN Security Council]] three times. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. Bulgaria is a [[developing country]] and ranks 52nd in the [[Human Development Index]], the lowest development rank in the EU alongside [[Romania]]. [[Corruption in Bulgaria|Widespread corruption]] is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/files/content/pages/2018_CPI_Executive_Summary.pdf |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 Executive Summary p. 12 |publisher=[[Transparency International]]|website=transparency.org |access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Bulgaria'' is derived from the ''[[Bulgars]]'', a tribe of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin that founded the country. Their name is not completely understood and is difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD,{{sfn|Golden|1992|pages=103–104}} but it is possibly derived from the [[Proto-Turkic]] word ''bulģha'' (&quot;to mix&quot;, &quot;shake&quot;, &quot;stir&quot;) and its derivative ''bulgak'' (&quot;revolt&quot;, &quot;disorder&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowersock|first=Glen W.|title=Late Antiquity: a Guide to the Postclassical World|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=354|year=1999|isbn=978-0674511736|url={{Google books|c788wWR_bLwC|page=354|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning may be further extended to &quot;rebel&quot;, &quot;incite&quot; or &quot;produce a state of disorder&quot;, and so, in the derivative, the &quot;disturbers&quot;.{{sfn|Chen|2012|page=97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petersen|first=Leif Inge Ree|title=Siege Warfare and Military Organization in the Successor States (400–800 AD): Byzantium, the West and Islam|publisher=Brill |year=2013|page=369 |isbn=978-9004254466|url={{Google books|BRGaAAAAQBAJ|page=369|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Golden|1992|page=104}} Ethnic groups in [[Inner Asia]] with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the [[Jie people|Buluoji]], a component of the &quot;[[Five Barbarians|Five Barbarian]]&quot; groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a &quot;mixed race&quot; and &quot;troublemakers&quot;.{{sfn|Chen|2012|pages=92–95, 97}}

Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, [[Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040-1041)|the largest]] being led by [[Peter Delyan]]. The empire's authority declined after a catastrophic military [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat at Manzikert]] against [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] invaders, and was further disturbed by the [[Crusades]]. This prevented Byzantine attempts at [[Hellenisation]] and created fertile ground for further revolt. In 1185 [[Asen dynasty]] nobles [[Ivan Asen I]] and [[Peter IV of Bulgaria|Peter IV]] organized a [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|major uprising]] and succeeded in re-establishing the Bulgarian state.

The Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country from west to east. The mountainous southwest has two distinct [[Glacial landform|alpine type]] ranges - [[Rila]] and [[Pirin]], which border the lower but more extensive [[Rhodope Mountains]] to the east, and various medium altitude mountains to west, northwest and south, like [[Vitosha]], [[Osogovo]] and [[Belasitsa]].{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}} [[Musala]], at {{convert|2925|m|ft|0}}, is the highest point in both Bulgaria and the Balkan peninsula.

Bulgaria is a [[parliamentary democracy]] where the [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]] and the most powerful executive position.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}} The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with [[universal suffrage]] for [[citizen]]s at least 18 years old. The [[Constitution of Bulgaria|Constitution]] also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national [[referendum|referenda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DD-Navi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/countries/bulgaria/legal_designs|title=Overview of direct democratic instruments in Bulgaria|publisher=Navigator to Direct Democracy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183501/http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/countries/bulgaria/legal_designs|archive-date=16 January 2014|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=17}} Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}}

Unlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected [[President of Bulgaria|president]] serves as [[head of state]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the [[presidential veto]] by a simple majority vote.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}} Political parties gather in the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]], a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|pages=16–17}}

[[Freedom House]] has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance after 2009, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms, abuse of authority at the highest level and increased dependence of local administrations on the central government.&lt;ref name=&quot;FH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2018/bulgaria|title=Bulgaria Country Profile|publisher=Freedom House|first=Emilia|last=Zankina|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria is still [[Freedom in the World|listed as &quot;Free&quot;]], with a political system designated as a semi-consolidated democracy, albeit with deteriorating scores.&lt;ref name=&quot;FH&quot;/&gt; The [[Democracy Index]] defines it as a &quot;Flawed democracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2017|title=Democracy Index 2017: Free speech under attack|publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 survey by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] reported that less than 15% of respondents considered elections to be fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPI&quot;/&gt;

=== Legal system === 
Bulgaria has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Bulgaria.html |title=The Bulgarian Legal System and Legal Research |publisher=Hauser Global Law School Program|date=August 2006 |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=17}} The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges.

All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces are subdivided into 265 [[Municipalities of Bulgaria|municipalities]]. Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly [[centralization|centralized]] state where the [[Government of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=17}}
