The '''Piano Trio''' in [[B-flat major]], [[Opus number|Op]]. 97, by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] is a [[piano trio]] completed in 1811.  It is commonly referred to as the '''Archduke Trio''', because it was dedicated to [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788–1831)|Archduke Rudolph of Austria]], the youngest of twelve children of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Rudolf was an amateur pianist and a patron, friend, and composition student of Beethoven. Beethoven dedicated a total of fourteen compositions to the Archduke, who dedicated one of his own to Beethoven in return.

The trio was written late in Beethoven's so-called &quot;middle period&quot;. He began composing it in the summer of 1810, and completed it in March 1811.

Although the &quot;Archduke Trio&quot; is sometimes numbered as &quot;No. 7&quot;, the numbering of Beethoven's twelve piano trios is not standardized, and in other sources the Op. 97 trio may be shown as having a different number, if any.

==First performance==
The first public performance was given by Beethoven himself, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]] (violin) and [[Josef Linke]] (cello) at the Viennese hotel ''Zum römischen Kaiser'' on 11 April 1814, as his deafness continued to encroach upon his ability as a performer. After a repeat of the work a few weeks later, Beethoven did not appear again in public as a pianist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Piano_Trio_in_B-flat_major,_Op.97_(Beethoven,_Ludwig_van) Piano Trio in B-flat major, Op.97] imslp.org, accessed 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moran&gt;[http://bf.press.illinois.edu/view.php?vol=14&amp;iss=1&amp;f=br_2.pdf Historically Informed Performances: “Archduke” and “Ghost” Trios, by John Moran] bf.press.illinois.edu, accessed 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orga&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TVde8Ah-PqgC&amp;pg=PT241&amp;lpg=PT241&amp;dq=archduke+trio+schuppanzigh+spohr Beethoven: Illustrated Lives Of The Great Composers, by Ates Orga] accessed 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The violinist and composer [[Louis Spohr]] witnessed a rehearsal of the work, and wrote:  &quot;On account of his deafness there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist which had formerly been so greatly admired. In ''forte'' passages the poor deaf man pounded on the keys until the strings jangled, and in ''piano'' he played so softly that whole groups of notes were omitted, so that the music was unintelligible unless one could look into the pianoforte part. I was deeply saddened at so hard a fate.&quot;&lt;ref name=orga/&gt;

The pianist and composer [[Ignaz Moscheles]] attended the first performance, and wrote about the work: &quot;In the case of how many compositions is the word &quot;new&quot; misapplied! But never in Beethoven's, and least of all in this, which again is full of originality. His playing, aside from its intellectual element, satisfied me less, being wanting in clarity and precision; but I observed many traces of the grand style of playing which I had long recognized in his compositions.&quot;&lt;ref name=moran/&gt;

==Structure==
The work is in four [[movement (music)|movements]]:

#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] moderato, 4/4
#[[Scherzo]] ([[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]]), 3/4
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Andante]] cantabile ma però con moto. Poco piu adagio, [[D major]], 3/4
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] moderato{{spaced ndash}}Presto, 2/4{{spaced ndash}}6/8

A typical performance runs approximately 36 to 45 minutes in length.
