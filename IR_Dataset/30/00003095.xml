}}The '''Amiga 500''', also known as the '''A500''', is the first low-end [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] [[16-bit|16]]/[[32-bit]] [[multimedia]] home/[[personal computer]]. It was announced at the winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1987{{snd}}at the same time as the high-end [[Amiga 2000]]{{snd}}and competed directly against the [[Atari ST|Atari 520ST]]. Before it shipped Commodore suggested a list price of {{nowrap|[[United States dollar|US$]]595.95}} without a monitor. At delivery in October 1987 Commodore announced that the machine would carry a {{nowrap|US$699/£499}} list price.

In Europe the Amiga 500 was released in May 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/sales.html|title=Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures|website=www.amigahistory.plus.com|access-date=2020-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands it was available from April 1987 for a list price of 1499 [[Dutch guilder|HFL]] (US$730 in 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nieuwsblad van het Noorden, 1987-04-23 |website=www.dekrantvantoen.nl |url=http://www.dekrantvantoen.nl/vw/article.do?id=NVHN-19870423-AE0028001&amp;vw=org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga 500 represents a return to Commodore's roots by being sold in the same mass retail outlets as the [[Commodore 64]]{{snd}}to which it was a spiritual successor{{snd}}as opposed to the computer-store-only [[Amiga 1000]], as well as being another computer whose keyboard is included in the same case.

The original Amiga 500 proved to be Commodore's best-selling Amiga model, enjoying particular success in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gareth Knight |url=http://www.amigau.com/aig/sales.html |title=Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures |publisher=amigau.com |website=www.amigau.com |accessdate=2013-07-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524012705/http://www.amigau.com/aig/sales.html |archivedate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although popular with hobbyists, arguably its most widespread use was as a gaming machine, where its advanced graphics and sound were of significant benefit.

It has been claimed that over 6 million A500s were sold worldwide,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} however, according to Commodore UK, the entire sales of all Amigas in both Europe and the USA were 4-5 million.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} While not the first computer to have an [[open architecture]], the Amiga is considered due to its expandability as one of the early examples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/history-of-computers,4518-31.html Computer History: From The Antikythera Mechanism To The Modern Era] on [[tomshardware.com]] by Aris Mpitziopoulos &quot;''Amiga was one of the first computers with an open architecture. It had two expansion slots, one on the side and one on the bottom.''&quot; (July 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Releases ==
In October 1989, the Amiga 500 dropped its price from [[Pound sterling|£]]499 to £399 and was bundled with the ''Batman Pack'' in the United Kingdom (from October 1989 to September 1990) which included the games [[Batman (1989 Ocean video game)|''Batman'']], ''[[F/A-18 Interceptor]]'', [[The NewZealand Story|''The New Zealand Story'']] and the bitmap graphics editor, [[Deluxe Paint|Deluxe Paint 2]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/a500batman.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also included was the Commodore [[Amiga video connector|A520]] RF Modulator, an adaptor which allowed the A500 to be used with a conventional CRT television set, via its RF antenna socket.

In late 1991, an enhanced model known as the [[Amiga 500 Plus]] replaced the original 500 in some markets; it was bundled with the ''Cartoon Classics'' pack in the United Kingdom at £399, although many stores still advertised it as an 'A500'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gareth Knight |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/cartoon.html |title=Cartoon Classics Bundles |website=Amigahistory.co.uk |date=2002-10-21 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga 500 series was discontinued in June 1992&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/AmigaShopperIssue15Jul92&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by the similarly specified and priced [[Amiga 600]], although this new machine had originally been intended as a much cheaper model, which would have been the A300. In late 1992, Commodore released the &quot;next-generation&quot; [[Amiga 1200]], a machine closer in concept to the original Amiga 500, but featuring significant technical improvements. Despite this, neither the A1200 nor the A600 replicated the commercial success of its predecessor, as by this time, the popular market was definitively shifting from the [[home computer]] platforms of the past to commodity [[Wintel]] [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]] and the new &quot;low-cost&quot; [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC|LC]] and [[IIsi]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gareth Knight |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/commodore.html |title=Commodore History |website=Amigahistory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Outwardly resembling the [[Commodore 128]]&lt;ref name=&quot;byte198706&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1987-06/1987_06_BYTE_12-06_CAD_Mice_12-MHz_ATs_IBM_PS2_Family#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Low-End Amiga | work=BYTE | date=June 1987 | accessdate=5 November 2013 | pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and codenamed &quot;[[Rock Lobster]]&quot; during development, the Amiga 500 houses the keyboard and CPU in one shell, unlike the [[Amiga 1000]]. It utilizes a Motorola 68000 microprocessor running at {{nowrap|7.15909 [[MHz]]}} (NTSC) or {{nowrap|7.09379 MHz}} (PAL). The CPU implements a 32-bit model, has 32-bit registers and 32-bit internal data bus, but it has a 16-bit main [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], uses a 16-bit external data bus and 24-bit address bus, providing a maximum of 16&amp;nbsp;MB of [[address space]].

The earliest Amiga 500 models use nearly the same [[Original Amiga chipset]] as the Amiga 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Agnus was enhanced to control up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB [[Random access memory|RAM]] and glue logic was integrated into [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] to reduce costs.&lt;/ref&gt; So graphics can be displayed in multiple resolutions and color depths, even on the same screen. Resolutions vary from 320×200 (up to 32 colors) to 640×400 (up to 16 colors) for NTSC (704×484 overscan) and 320×256 to 640×512 for PAL (704×576 overscan.)&lt;ref name=&quot;displaysize&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Peck|first1 = Robert|last2 = Deyl|first2 = Susan|last3 = Miner|first3 = Jay|last4 = Raymond|first4 = Chris|title = Amiga hardware reference manual|publisher = [[Addison Wesley]]|date=September 1986|page = 72|isbn = 0-201-11077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses [[planar (computer graphics)|planar]] graphics, with up to five bitplanes (four in high resolution) allowing 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-color screens, from a palette of 4096 colors. Two special graphics modes are also available: Extra HalfBrite, which uses a 6th bitplane as a mask to cut the brightness of any pixel in half (resulting in 32 arbitrary colors plus 32 more colors set at half the value of the first 32), and {{nowrap|[[Hold And Modify]] (HAM)}} which allows all 4096 colors to be used on screen simultaneously.&lt;ref name=bitplanes&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Peck|first1 = Robert|last2 = Deyl|first2 = Susan|last3 = Miner|first3 = Jay|last4 = Raymond|first4 = Chris|title = Amiga hardware reference manual|publisher = [[Addison Wesley]]|date=September 1986|page = 37|isbn = 0-201-11077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later revisions of the chipset are [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] switchable in software.

The sound chip produces four hardware-mixed channels, two to the left and two to the right, of 8-bit PCM at a sampling frequency of up to {{nowrap|28 kHz}}.  Each hardware channel has its own independent volume level and sampling rate, and can be designated to another channel where it can modulate both volume and frequency using its own output.  With [[Direct memory access|DMA]] disabled it's possible to output with a sampling frequency up to {{nowrap|56 kHz}}.  There's a common trick to [[Original Chip Set#Audio|output sound with 14-bit precision]] that can be combined to output 14-bit {{nowrap|56 kHz}} sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/mus/play/Play16 |title=Aminet: mus/play/Play16.lha |date=2003-11-09 |website=aminet.net |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stock system comes with [[AmigaOS]] version 1.2 or 1.3 and {{nowrap|512 KiB}} of [[Amiga Chip RAM|chip RAM]] (150 ns access time), one built-in double-density [[floppy disk drive|standard floppy disk drive]] that is completely programmable and can read {{nowrap|720 KiB}} [[IBM PC]] disks, {{nowrap|880 KiB}} standard Amiga disks, and up to {{nowrap|984 KiB}} using custom-formatting drivers.

Despite the lack of [[Amiga Zorro II|Amiga 2000-compatible internal expansion slots]], there are many ports and expansion options. There are two [[D-subminiature|DE9M]] [[Atari joystick port]]s for [[joystick]]s or [[mouse (computing)|mice]], stereo audio ([[RCA connector]]s 1&amp;nbsp;V [[peak-to-peak|p-p]]). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to three extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector.&lt;ref name=&quot;gbwxgm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |website=amigahardware.mariomisic.de |title=Hi Res Version, Rear of Amiga 500 - 122K|url=http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/download_photos/a500_4_big.jpg}} 070728 amigahardware.mariomisic.de&lt;/ref&gt; The then-standard [[RS-232]] serial port (DB25M) and [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]] (DB25F) are also included. The power supply is ({{nowrap|+5V}}, {{nowrap|+/-12V}}).&lt;ref name=itgehi&gt;{{cite web |website=www.ntrautanen.fi |title=Amiga 500/600/1200 Power Connector|url=http://www.ntrautanen.fi/computers/hardware/misc/a500_power.htm}} 070808 ntrautanen.fi&lt;/ref&gt; 
The system displays video in analog [[component video|RGB]] {{nowrap|50 [[hertz|Hz]]}} PAL or {{nowrap|60 Hz}} NTSC through a proprietary DB23M connector and in NTSC mode the line frequency is {{nowrap|15,750 Hz}} [[synchronization|HSync]] for standard video modes, which is compatible with NTSC television and CVBS/RGB video, but out of range for most [[video graphics array|VGA]]-compatible monitors, while a [[multisync monitor]] is required for some of the higher resolutions. This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] to provide output on [[television]]s with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome [[composite video]] is available via an [[RCA connector]] (also coaxial). There is also a Zorro bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's [[AutoConfig]] standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to {{nowrap|8 MB}} of so-called &quot;fast RAM&quot; (memory that can be accessed by the CPU only) can be added using the side expansion slot.  This connector is electronically identical with the Amiga 1000's, but swapped on the other side.

The Amiga 500 has a &quot;trap-door&quot; slot on the underside for a RAM upgrade (typically of {{nowrap|512 KiB}}). This extra RAM is classified as &quot;fast&quot; RAM, but is sometimes referred to as &quot;slow&quot; RAM: due to the design of the expansion bus, it is actually on the chipset bus. Such upgrades usually include a battery-backed [[real-time clock]]. All versions of the A500 can have the additional RAM configured as chip RAM by a simple hardware modification, which involves fitting a later model (8372A) [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip. Likewise, all versions of the A500 can be upgraded to {{nowrap|2 MB}} chip RAM by fitting the {{nowrap|8372B Agnus}} chip and adding additional memory.

The Amiga 500 also sports an unusual feature for a budget machine, socketed chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips. The CPU can be directly upgraded on the motherboard to a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]; or to a [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]], or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] via the side expansion slot; or by removing the CPU and plugging a CPU expansion card into the CPU socket (though this will require opening the computer and voiding any remaining warranty).  In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) versions.

The case is made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastics which may become brown with time. This may be reversed by using the [[public-domain]] chemical mix &quot;[[Retr0bright]]&quot;, though without a clearcoat to block oxygen, the brown colouring will return.

Whenever the computer is powered on a self-diagnostic test is run that will show any failure with a specific colour where {{background color|#00B300|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} medium green means no chip RAM found or is damaged, {{background color|darkred|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} red means bad [[Kickstart (Amiga)|kickstart]]-[[Read-only memory|ROM]], {{background color|yellow|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} yellow means the [[central processing unit|CPU]] has crashed (no trap routine or trying to run bad code) or a bad [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro]] [[expansion card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=497 abime.net - Question blinking power LED/no screen on Amiga 500] read 2011-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{background color|blue|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} Blue means custom chip problem ([[Denise (OCS)|Denise]], [[Paula (computer chip)|Paula]], or [[Original Chip Set#Agnus|Agnus]]),
{{background color|lime|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|light green}} means [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] problem.
Stopping on {{background color|silver|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|light gray}} means that the CIA might be defective. {{nowrap|{{background color|black|&amp;nbsp;}} {{background color|black|&amp;nbsp;}} Black and white stripes}}&lt;!--verify?--&gt; mean there is a ROM or [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] problem, while
{{background color|black|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} black only (no video) means there is no video output.&lt;ref name=a3b&gt;[http://amiga.serveftp.net/A3000_HardwareGuide/booting-problems.html amiga.serveftp.net - A3000 Booting Problems] read 2011-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;
The keyboard [[light-emitting diode|LED]] uses blink codes: one blink means the keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure.&lt;ref name=a3b/&gt; Using [[Caps Lock]] key and getting a response means [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] and the CPU works.&lt;ref name=a3b/&gt; There is no guarantee that every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is '''very''' brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so there is no guarantee that any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvqZuIs8uJg youtube.com - Discussion relating to incorrect diagnostic of green screen fault on Amiga 500] retrieved 2017-03-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical specifications ==
[[Image:Amiga 1.3 and disks.jpg|thumb|right|The standard Amiga 500 requires floppies to boot]]
* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] (1.2 &amp; 1.3 models) or [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] (1.3 and 500+ 2.04 models) chipset. ECS revisions of the chipset made [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] mode switchable in software.
** Graphics can be of arbitrary dimensions, resolution and colour depth, even on the same screen.
** Without using overscan, the graphics can be 320 or 640 pixels wide by 200/256 or 400/512 pixels tall.
** [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] graphics are used, with up to 5 bitplanes (4 in hires); this allowed 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 colour screens, from a palette of 4096 colours. Two special graphics modes were also included: Extra HalfBrite, which used a 6th bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen, and [[Hold And Modify]] (HAM), which allowed all 4096 colours on screen at once.
** [[Rhett Anderson]] developed the so-called ''Sliced HAM'' or ''SHAM'' mode, which is based on HAM mode, but used the [[Original Amiga chipset#Copper|Copper]] (part of the Agnus chip which can change hardware registers at given screen positions) to reprogram the color palette registers at each scanline. The advantage of SHM files is the ability to display all 4096 colors while eliminating the color blur of HAM compression.
** Sound is 4 hardware-mixed channels of 8-bit sound at up to {{nowrap|28 kHz}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amiga 500 |website=www.old-computers.com |url=http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=65&amp;st=1 |accessdate=December 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330022140/http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=65| archive-date=March 30, 2010  |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware channels have independent volumes (65 levels) and sampling rates, and are mixed down to two fully left and fully right stereo outputs. A software controllable low-pass audio filter is also included.
* 512&amp;nbsp;KB of chip RAM (150&amp;nbsp;ns access time).
* [[AmigaOS]] 1.2 or 1.3  (upgradeable up to 3.1.4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AmigaOS 3.1.4 on A500 |website=amigax1000.blogspot.com |url=http://amigax1000.blogspot.com/2018/12/amigaos-314-on-a500.html |accessdate=September 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; if 2MB of RAM are installed)
* One double-density [[floppy disk drive]] is built in, which is completely programmable and thus can read {{nowrap|720 KiB}} [[IBM PC]] disks, {{nowrap|880 KiB}} standard Amiga disks, and up to {{nowrap|984 KiB}} with custom formatting (such as Klaus Deppich's [http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/Diskspr3 diskspare.device]). Uses {{nowrap|300 rpm}} (5 rotations/second) and {{nowrap|250 kbit/s}}.
* Built in keyboard.
* A two-button mouse is included.

=== Graphics ===
* [[PAL]] mode: 320×256, 640×256, 640×512 ([[Interlaced video|interlaced]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;amiga.lychesis.net&quot;&gt;http://amiga.lychesis.net/knowledge/ScreenModes.html&lt;/ref&gt; 704×576 in overscan.
* [[NTSC]] mode: 320×200, 640×200, 640×400 (interlaced),&lt;ref name=&quot;amiga.lychesis.net&quot;/&gt; 704×484 in overscan.
Max 6 [[Color depth|bpp]]. The Amiga can show multiple resolution modes at the same time, splitting the screen vertically. An additional mode called [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM) makes it possible to utilize {{nowrap|12 bpp}} over a {{nowrap|3 [[pixel]]s}} wide span. This works by letting each pixel position use the previous RGB value and modify one of the red, green or blue values to a new 4-bit value. This will cause some negligible colour artifacts however.

=== Connectors ===
[[Image:AMIGA500-3.jpg|thumb|290px|Backside with connectors]]
[[Image:Amiga_520_1.jpg|thumb|right|The Amiga 520 adapter allowed for an [[RF modulator|RF modulated]] output, to be connected to a TV]]
* Two [[DE-9 connector|DE9M]] [[Atari joystick port]]s for [[joystick]]s or [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]
* Stereo audio ([[RCA connector]]s 1&amp;nbsp;V [[Peak-to-peak|p-p]])
* A floppy drive port (DB23F), for daisy-chaining up to 3 extra floppy disk drives via an [[D-subminiature|DB23F]] connector&lt;ref name=&quot;gbwxgm&quot;/&gt;
* A standard [[RS-232]] serial port (DB25M)
* A [[parallel port]] (DB25F)
* Power inlet ({{nowrap|+5 V}}, {{nowrap|+/-12 V}})&lt;ref name = &quot;itgehi&quot; /&gt;
* Analogue [[RGB color model|RGB]] 50&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] PAL and {{nowrap|60 Hz}} NTSC video output, provided on an Amiga-specific [[DB23]]M [[Amiga video connector|video connector]]. Can drive video with {{nowrap|15,750 Hz}} [[Synchronization|HSync]] for standard Amiga video modes. This is not compatible with most [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] monitors. A [[Multisync monitor]] is required for some higher resolutions. This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. An [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] (A520) was frequently bundled with the machine to provide output on regular [[television]]s or on [[composite video|composite]] monitors. A digital 16 colour Red-Green-Blue-Intensity signal is available too on the same connector.
* Monochrome video via an [[RCA connector]]
* [[Zorro II]] bus expansion on the left side behind a plastic cover
* Trapdoor slot under the machine, for RAM expansion and [[real-time clock]]

=== Expansions ===
* Expansion ports are limited to a side expansion port and a trapdoor expansion on the underside of the machine. The casing can also be opened up (voiding the warranty), all larger chips are socketed rather than being [[Through-hole technology|TH]]/[[Surface Mount Device|SMD]] soldered directly to the motherboard, so they can be replaced by hand.
* The CPU can be upgraded to a Motorola 68010 directly or to a 68020, 68030 or 68040 via the side expansion slot or a CPU socket adapter board.
* The chip RAM can be upgraded to 1&amp;nbsp;MB directly on the motherboard, provided a [[Fat Agnus]] chip is also installed to support it.
* Likewise, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Extended chip set|ECS]] chipset.
* The A500+ model instead allowed upgrading by {{nowrap|1 MB}} trapdoor chip RAM without clock, but there was no visible means on board to map any of this as FAST, causing incompatibility with some stubbornly coded programs.
* There were modification instructions available for the A500 to solder or socket another 512&amp;nbsp;RAM on the board, then run extra address lines to the trapdoor slot to accommodate an additional {{nowrap|1 MB}} of fast or chip RAM depending on the installed chipset.
* Up to 8&amp;nbsp;MB of &quot;fast RAM&quot; can be added via the side expansion slot, even more if an [[Hardware acceleration|accelerator]] with a non-EC (without reduced data/address bus) processor and 32-bit RAM is used.
* Hard drive and other peripherals can be added via the side expansion slot.
* Several companies provided combined CPU, memory and hard drive upgrades{{snd}}or provided chainable expansions that extended the bus as they were added{{snd}}as there is only one side expansion slot.
* Expansions are configured automatically by [[AutoConfig]] software, so multiple pieces of hardware did not conflict with each other.

== Trap-door expansion 501 ==
[[Image:RAM 512K for Amiga 500 ubt.jpeg|thumb|An A501 compatible expansion]]
A popular expansion for the Amiga 500 was the Amiga 501 circuit board that can be installed underneath the computer behind a plastic cover. It contains {{nowrap|512 KiB}} RAM configured by default as &quot;[[Amiga Chip RAM#Fast RAM|Slow RAM]]&quot; or &quot;trap-door RAM&quot; and a battery-backed [[real-time clock]] (RTC). However, the RAM is pseudo-fast RAM, only accessible by the processor, but still as slow as chip RAM. The motherboard can be modified to relocate the trap-door RAM to the chip memory pool, provided a compatible [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip is fitted on the motherboard.
