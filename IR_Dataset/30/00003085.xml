'''Alexandria Troas''' (&quot;Alexandria of the [[Troad]]&quot;; {{lang-el|Αλεξάνδρεια Τρωάς}}; {{lang-tr|Eski Stambul}}) is the site of an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city situated on the [[Aegean Sea]] near the northern tip of [[Turkey]]'s western coast, a little south of [[Tenedos]] (modern [[Bozcaada]]). It is located southeast of modern Dalyan, a village in the [[Ezine, Çanakkale|Ezine]] district of [[Çanakkale Province]]. The site sprawls over an estimated {{convert|400|ha}}; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined [[Thermae|bath]], an [[Odeon (building)|odeon]], a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]], [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] complex&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;&gt;[[John Freely]] (2003). ''The Aegean Coast of Turkey''. Redhouse Press, Istanbul, pp.3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently uncovered [[Stadion (running race)|stadion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;/&gt;  The circuit of the old walls can still be traced.

==History==

===Hellenistic===
According to [[Strabo]], this site was first called Sigeia (Σιγία);&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:13.1.47 Strabo, Geography, 13.47]&lt;/ref&gt; around 306&amp;nbsp;BC [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendering&quot;&gt;Jona Lendering (2006). [http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexandria/alexandria_troas.html Alexandria in Troas] (from Livius.org). Retrieved 2010-4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; including the once influential city of [[Neandreia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewett&quot;&gt;Robert Jewett (2005). [http://www.philipharland.com/travel/TravelJewettTroas.pdf The Troas Project: Investigating Maritime and Land Routes to Clarify the Role of Alexandria Troas in Commerce and Religion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014702/http://www.philipharland.com/travel/TravelJewettTroas.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }} Retrieved 2010-4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not receive its name until its name was changed by [[Lysimachus]] to Alexandria Troas, in 301 BC, in memory of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] [[Macedon|of Macedon]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] merely states, in his view, that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Naturalis Historia'' 5:124.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, Pliny's view is not correct, because the city continued being called Alexandria Troas, and so is also stated in the 4th-5th c. AD Tabula Peutingeriana. As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a &quot;free and autonomous city&quot; as early as 188&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendering&quot;/&gt; and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewett&quot;/&gt; [[Strabo]] mentions that a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] was created at the location in the reign of [[Augustus]], named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, [[Hadrian]] and the rich grammarian [[Herodes Atticus]] contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. [[Constantine I|Constantine]] considered making Troas the capital of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Troas|first=Siméon|last=Vailhé|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman===
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between [[Anatolia]] and Europe. According to the account in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]]. ''[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]'' 16:8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of [[Eutychus]] is said to have occurred&lt;ref&gt;''[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]'' 20:5-12.&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Ignatius of Antioch]] also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ignatius of Antioch]]. ''Ad Philad''. 11:2; ''Ad Smyrn''. 12:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine===
Several of its later [[bishop]]s are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]], and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of [[Cyzicus]] and distinct from the famous [[Troy]] ([[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum'', 552; ''[[Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani]]'', 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The bishopric remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Catholic Church]] under the name Troas, vacant since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 997&lt;/ref&gt;

Troas is also a titular see of the [[Orthodox Church]] under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Bishop Savas (Zembillas) of Troas&lt;ref&gt;Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (2002-1-28). [http://www.goarch.org/news/goa.news92 Ordination of Bishop-Elect Savas Zembillas on Saturday, February 2, 2002 at Holy Trinity Cathedral.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613094805/http://goarch.org/news/goa.news92 |date=2010-06-13 }} Retrieved 2010-4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; served as hierarch from 2002 to 2011, and then became [[Metropolitan Savas (Zembillas) of Pittsburgh]] in the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (2011-11-3). [http://www.goarch.org/news/metsavaselection-11032011 Bishop Savas of Troas Elected Metropolitan of Pittsburgh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104135701/http://www.goarch.org/news/metsavaselection-11032011 |date=2011-11-04 }}. Retrieved 2011-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman===
[[Karasids|Karasid]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turkomans]] settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their ''[[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|beylik]]'' was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as ''Eski Stambul'', the &quot;Old City&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;/&gt; The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example [[Mehmed IV]] took columns to adorn his [[Yeni Valide Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]). As of the mid-18th century the site served as &quot;a lurking place for bandetti&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Chandler. ''Travels in Asia Minor, 1764-65.'' Quoted in Freely, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
By 1911, the site had been overgrown with [[Vallonea oak]]s and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. 
They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alexandria Troas|volume=1|page=575|first=David George|last=Hogarth|authorlink=David George Hogarth}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as ''Bal Saray'' (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;/&gt; [[Trajan]] built an aqueduct which can still be traced.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt; 
The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. 
It is the subject of an early twenty-first century study by German archaeologists digging and surveying at the site. 
Their excavation uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;&gt;Gina Jacobs (2010).
