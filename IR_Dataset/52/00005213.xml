'''Computing''' is any activity that uses [[computer]]s to manage, process, and communicate information. It includes development of both hardware and software. Computing is a critical, integral component of modern industrial technology. Major computing disciplines include computer engineering, software engineering, [[computer science]], information systems, and information technology.

== Definitions ==

The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] ''Computing Curricula 2005''&lt;ref name=curricula&gt;{{cite web|author=The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf|title=Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined &quot;computing&quot; as follows:

{{quote|&quot;In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast.&quot;}}

ACM also defines five sub-disciplines of the ''computing'' field:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations |title=Curricula Recommendations |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Computer engineering]].
* [[Computer science]].
* [[Information system]]s.
* [[Information technology]].
* [[Software engineering]].

However, ''Computing Curricula 2005''&lt;ref name=curricula/&gt; also recognizes that the meaning of &quot;computing&quot; depends on the context:

{{quote|''Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.''}}

The term &quot;computing&quot; has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] report on ''Computing as a Discipline'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf |title=Computing as a Discipline |date=January 1989 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |author=Peter J. Denning |accessdate=2012-11-30 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1145/63238.63239 |volume=32 |pages=9–23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928184550/http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''The discipline of computing is the systematic study of [[algorithm]]ic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all computing is &quot;What can be (efficiently) automated?&quot; ''}}

The term &quot;computing&quot; is also [[synonymous]] with counting and calculating. In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by [[Mechanical computer|mechanical computing machines]], and before that, to [[human computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/computer-hist-web.htm|title=The History of Computing|website=mason.gmu.edu|access-date=2019-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of computing|Timeline of computing}}

The history of computing is longer than the [[history of computing hardware]] and [[computer|modern computing technology]] and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.

Computing is intimately tied to the representation of [[number]]s. But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization.{{clarify|date=June 2019 |reason=Referring to math without numbers can confuse people unfamiliar with this subject}} These concepts include [[one-to-one correspondence]] (the basis of counting), comparison to a standard (used for measurement), and the ''3-4-5'' right triangle (a device for assuring a ''right angle'').

The earliest known tool for use in computation was the [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] circa 2400 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known calculation aid – preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years{{citation needed|reason=What Greek methods?|date=March 2018}}.

The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper &quot;The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena&quot; by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wynn-Williams | first = C. E. | author-link = C. E. Wynn-Williams | title = The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 132 | issue = 819 | pages = 295–310 | date = July 2, 1931 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1931.0102 |bibcode = 1931RSPSA.132..295W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Shannon]]'s 1938 paper &quot;[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]&quot; then introduced the idea of using electronics for [[Boolean algebra]]ic operations.

The concept of a [[field-effect transistor]] was proposed by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] in 1925. [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Brattain]], while working under [[William Shockley]] at [[Bell Labs]], built the first working [[transistor]], the [[point-contact transistor]], in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Thomas H. |title=The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits |date=2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781139643771 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee214/ee214.1032/Handouts/HO2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puers&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Puers |first1=Robert |last2=Baldi |first2=Livio |last3=Voorde |first3=Marcel Van de |last4=Nooten |first4=Sebastiaan E. van |title=Nanoelectronics: Materials, Devices, Applications, 2 Volumes |date=2017 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9783527340538 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOqVDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the [[University of Manchester]] built the first [[transistorized computer]], called the [[Manchester computers|Transistor Computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lavington|first=Simon|title=A History of Manchester Computers|year=1998|edition=2|publisher=The British Computer Society|location=Swindon|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, early [[junction transistor]]s were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moskowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moskowitz |first1=Sanford L. |title=Advanced Materials Innovation: Managing Global Technology in the 21st century |date=2016 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470508923 |pages=165–167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2STRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MOSFET|metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) was invented by [[Mohamed Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] at Bell Labs in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/metal-oxide-semiconductor-mos-transistor-demonstrated/|title=1960 - Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Transistor Demonstrated|journal=The Silicon Engine|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lojek&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |pages=321–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first truly compact transistor that could be [[MOSFET scaling|miniaturised]] and [[Moore's law|mass-produced]] for a wide range of uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moskowitz&quot;/&gt; The MOSFET made it possible to build [[very large-scale integration|high-density]] [[integrated circuit]] chips,&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory-transistor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Invented the Transistor? |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-invented-the-transistor/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |date=4 December 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hittinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hittinger |first1=William C. |title=Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Technology |journal=Scientific American |date=1973 |volume=229 |issue=2 |pages=48–59 |issn=0036-8733|jstor=24923169 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0873-48 |bibcode=1973SciAm.229b..48H }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is known as the [[computer revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fossum |first1=Jerry G. |last2=Trivedi |first2=Vishal P. |title=Fundamentals of Ultra-Thin-Body MOSFETs and FinFETs |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107434493 |page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZJfAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[microcomputer revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malmstadt |first1=Howard V. |last2=Enke |first2=Christie G. |last3=Crouch |first3=Stanley R. |title=Making the Right Connections: Microcomputers and Electronic Instrumentation |date=1994 |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |isbn=9780841228610 |page=389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyJGAQAAIAAJ |quote=The relative simplicity and low power requirements of MOSFETs have fostered today's microcomputer revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer ==
{{Main|Computer|Outline of computers|Glossary of computer terms}}

A computer is a machine that manipulates [[Data (computing)|data]] according to a set of instructions called a computer program.  The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.  The same program in its human-readable source code form, enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the CPU type.

The execution [[process (computing)|process]] carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the computations performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] of the instructions.

=== Computer software and hardware ===
Computer software or just &quot;software&quot;, is a collection of computer programs and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. Program software performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast with the old term hardware (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software is intangible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software
| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning application software only.

==== Application software ====
{{Main|Application software}}

Application software, also known as an &quot;application&quot; or an &quot;app&quot;, is a [[computer software]] designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include [[enterprise software]], [[accounting software]], [[office suite]]s, [[graphics software]] and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s.  Many application programs deal principally with [[Document file format|documents]].  Apps may be [[Product bundling|bundled]] with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately.  Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install additional applications.

Application software is contrasted with [[system software]] and [[middleware]], which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user.  The system software serves the application, which in turn serves the user.

Application software applies the power of a particular [[computing platform]] or system software to a particular purpose.  Some apps such as [[Microsoft Office]] are available in versions for several different platforms; others have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|Geography]] application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application for [[Educational software|education]] or [[Linux gaming]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]].

====System software====
{{Main|System software}}

System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software.  System software includes [[operating system]]s, [[utility software]], [[device driver]]s, [[window system]]s, and [[firmware]].  Frequently development tools such as [[compiler]]s, [[linker (computing)|linker]]s, and [[Debugging|debuggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=system software |last=Rouse|first=Margaret|publisher=TechTarget|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|website = WhatIs.com|date = March 2019|url = https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/system-software}}&lt;/ref&gt; are classified as system software.

=== Computer network ===
{{Main|Computer network}}

A computer network, often simply referred to as a network, is a collection of hardware components and computers '''[[Computer network|interconnected]]''' by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |title=Computer network definition |accessdate=2011-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121061919/http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |archivedate=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices are said to be in a network.

Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data, [[communications protocol]] used, scale, [[Network topology|topology]], and organizational scope.

[[Communications protocol]]s define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network, and provide the basis for [[computer network programming|network programming]]. Well-known communications protocols are [[Ethernet]], a hardware and [[Link Layer]] standard that is ubiquitous in [[local area network]]s, and the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], which defines a set of protocols for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks, as well as host-to-host data transfer, and application-specific data transmission formats.

Computer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of [[electrical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines.

==== Internet ====
{{main|Internet}}
The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of [[information]] resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]]  and the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support [[email]].

=== Computer programming ===
{{Main|Computer programming|Software engineering}}

Computer programming in general is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code and documentation of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]], which is an [[artificial language]] often more restrictive or demanding than [[natural language]]s, but easily translated by the computer. The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior (customization) from the machine. The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain  ''and'' the computer science domain.  The highest-quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts, each person a specialist in some area of development.  But the term ''programmer'' may apply to a range of program quality, from [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] to [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|open source contributor]] to professional. And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the [[proof of concept]] to launch a new [[Killer application|&quot;killer&quot; application]].

==== Computer programmer ====
{{Main|Programmer|Software engineer|Software developer}}

A programmer, computer programmer, or coder is a person who writes [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computer programming]] or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]], etc.) is often prefixed to the above titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with ''web''. The term ''programmer'' can be used to refer to a [[software developer]], [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], or [[software analyst]]. However, members of these [[profession]]s typically&lt;ref&gt;https://news.codecademy.com/5-skills-developers-need-beyond-writing-code/&lt;/ref&gt; possess other [[software engineering]] skills, beyond programming.

=== Computer industry ===
{{Main|Computer industry}}

The computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing [[computer software]], designing [[computer hardware]] and [[computer networking]] infrastructures, the manufacture of [[computer]] components and the provision of [[information technology]] services including [[System administrator|system administration]] and maintenance.

==== Software industry ====
{{Main|Software industry}}

The software industry includes businesses engaged in [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]]. The industry also includes software [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], and [[consultancy|consulting]].

=={{Anchor|DISCIPLINES}}Sub-disciplines of computing==

=== Computer engineering ===
{{Main|Computer engineering}}

Computer engineering is a [[academic discipline|discipline]] that integrates several fields of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] required to develop computer hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = IEEE Computer Society | authorlink = IEEE Computer Society |author2=ACM |authorlink2=Association for Computing Machinery  | title = Computer Engineering 2004: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering | url = http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/CE-Final-Report.pdf | accessdate = 2012-12-17 |date=12 December 2004 | page = iii | quote = Computer System engineering has traditionally been viewed as a combination ofboth electronic engineering (EE) and computer science (CS).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer engineers usually have training in [[electronic engineering]] (or [[electrical engineering]]), [[software design]], and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual [[microprocessor]]s, [[personal computer]]s, and [[supercomputer]]s, to [[circuit design]]. This field of engineering not only focuses on the design of hardware within its own domain, but as well the interactions between hardware and the world around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 | last = Trinity College Dublin | url = http://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/about/what_is_eng/computer_eng_intro.html | title = What is Computer System Engineering | accessdate = 2006-04-21}}, &quot;Computer engineers need not only to understand how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. Consider the car. A modern car contains many separate computer systems for controlling such things as the engine timing, the brakes and the air bags. To be able to design and implement such a car, the computer engineer needs a broad theoretical understanding of all these various subsystems &amp; how they interact.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software engineering ===
{{Main|Software engineering}}

Software engineering (SE) is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of [[software]], and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of [[engineering]] to software.&lt;ref name=&quot;BoDu04&quot;&gt;{{cite book|pages =1| first1= Alain| last1=Abran| first2=James W.| last2=Moore| first3=Pierre| last3=Bourque| first4=Robert| last4=Dupuis| first5=Leonard L.| last5=Tripp| title=Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge| year=2004| publisher=IEEE| isbn=978-0-7695-2330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ACM | year = 2006 | url = http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 | title = Computing Degrees &amp; Careers | publisher = ACM | accessdate = 2010-11-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053818/http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 | archive-date = 2011-06-17 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laplante | first = Phillip | title = What Every Engineer Should Know about Software Engineering | publisher = CRC | location = Boca Raton | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8493-7228-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pFHYk0KWAEgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=What%20Every%20Engineer%20Should%20Know%20about%20Software%20Engineering.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage | accessdate = 2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In layman's terms, it is the act of using insights to conceive, model and scale a solution to a problem.

Bauer|Fritz Bauer]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Software development]]'', a much used and more generic term, does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm. The generally accepted concepts of Software Engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the Guide to the [[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge]] (SWEBOK). The SWEBOK has become an internationally accepted standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897| id= ISO/IEC TR 19759:2015| accessdate = 21 May 2019|title = Software Engineering -- Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge (SWEBOK)|publisher = International Organization for Standardization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer science ===
{{Main|Computer science|Computer scientist}}

Computer science or computing science (abbreviated CS or Comp Sci) is the [[science|scientific]] and practical approach to [[computation]] and its applications. A [[computer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search - 3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in [[computer system]]s and purely theoretical areas. Some, such as [[computational complexity theory]], which studies fundamental properties of [[computational problem]]s, are highly abstract, while others, such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], emphasize real-world applications. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, [[programming language theory]] studies approaches to description of computations, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]], and [[human–computer interaction]] focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to [[human]]s.

=== Information technology ===
{{Main|Information technology}}

Information technology (IT) is the application of [[computer]]s and [[telecommunications equipment]] to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data,&lt;ref name=&quot;DOP&quot;&gt;

==== Systems administration ====
{{Main|System administrator}}

A system administrator, IT systems administrator, systems administrator, or sysadmin is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network. The duties of a system administrator are wide-ranging, and may vary substantially from one organization to another. Sysadmins are usually charged with installing, supporting and maintaining [[server (computing)|server]]s or other computer systems, and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems. Other duties may include [[Scripting language|scripting]] or light [[computer programming|programming]], [[project management]] for systems-related projects, supervising or training computer operators, and being the consultant for computer problems beyond the knowledge of [[technical support]] staff.

Fiber-optic and photonic (optical) devices, which already have been used to transport data over long distances, have started being used by data centers, side by side with CPU and semiconductor memory components. This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/25924/?a=f Tom Simonite, &quot;Computing at the speed of light&quot;, ''Technology Review'' Wed., August 4, 2010] [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has created an [[integrated circuit]] with both electronic and optical information processing in one chip. This is denoted &quot;CMOS-integrated nanophotonics&quot; or  (CINP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/computing/142881-ibm-creates-first-cheap-commercially-viable-silicon-nanophotonic-chip Sebastian Anthony (Dec 10,2012), &quot;IBM creates first commercially viable silicon nanophotonic chip&quot;], accessdate=2012-12-10&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of optical interconnects is that motherboards which formerly required a certain kind of system on a chip (SoC)  can now move formerly dedicated memory and network controllers off the motherboards,  spreading the controllers out onto the rack. This allows standardization of backplane interconnects and motherboards for multiple types of SoCs, which allows more timely upgrades of CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/open-compute-does-the-data-center-have-an-open-future-7000013012/ Open Compute: Does the data center have an open future?] accessdate=2013-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Spintronics can provide computing power and storage, without heat buildup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6935638.stm Putting electronics in a spin]&lt;/ref&gt; Some research is being done on hybrid chips, which combine [[photonics]] and spintronics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spice.uni-mainz.de/files/2018/11/UFS_2018_Koopmans.pdf Merging spintronics with photonics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08062-4 Integrating all-optical switching with spintronics]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also research ongoing on combining [[plasmonics]], photonics, and electronics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaaw2687 Plasmonic nanogap enhanced phase-change devices with dual electrical-optical functionality]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Cloud Computing ===
Cloud computing is a model that allows for the use of computing resources, such as servers or applications, without the need for much interaction between the owner of these resources and the user using them. Typically, this is offered as a service making it another example of [[Software as a service|Software as a Service]], [[Platform as a service|Platforms as a Service]], and [[Infrastructure as a service|Infrastructure as a Service]] depending on what functionality is offered. Key characteristics include on-demand access, broad network access, and the capability of rapid scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/domanm/csci411/Handouts/NIST.pdf|title=The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing|last=|first=|date=September 2011|work=U.S. Department of Commerce|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud computing is also being talked about regarding energy conservation. Allowing thousands of instances of computation to occur on one single machine instead of thousands of individual machines could be a way to save energy. It would also ease the act of transitioning to more renewable energy because you would only need to power one server farm with a set of solar panels or wind turbines instead of millions of peoples' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berl|first=A.|last2=Gelenbe|first2=E.|last3=Girolamo|first3=M.

One of the major ones is security. With cloud computing companies having no obligation to tell you what data they have on you, where it's being kept, or how they are using it. Laws in the modern day are not yet equipped to handle these circumstances. In the future, lawmakers in many countries will have to push to regulate cloud computing and protect the privacy of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=L. M.|date=July 2009|title=Data Security in the World of Cloud Computing|journal=IEEE Security Privacy|volume=7|issue=4|pages=61–64|doi=10.1109/MSP.2009.87|issn=1558-4046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud computing is also a way for individual users or small business to benefit from [[economies of scale]]. While currently the cloud computing infrastructure is too underdeveloped to benefit the scientific community, within a few years of development it could also be used to help smaller research groups get the computing power they need to answer a lot of the world's questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iosup|first=A.|last2=Ostermann|first2=S.|last3=Yigitbasi|first3=M.

=== Quantum Computing ===
[[Quantum computing]] is an area of research that brings together the disciplines of computer science, information theory, and quantum physics. The idea of information being a basic part of physics is relatively new, but there seems to be a strong tie between information theory and quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steane|first=Andrew|date=1998-02-01|title=Quantum computing|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=117–173|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/61/2/002|issn=0034-4885|bibcode=1998RPPh...61..117S|arxiv=quant-ph/9708022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas traditional computing operates on a binary system of ones and zeros, quantum computing uses [[qubit]]s. Qubits are capable of being in a superposition, which means that they are in both states, one and zero, simultaneously. This means the qubit is not somewhere between 1 and 0, but actually the value of the qubit will change depending on when you measure it. This trait of qubits is called [[quantum entanglement]] and is the core idea of quantum computing and is what allows quantum computers to do the large scale equations they are used for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horodecki|first=Ryszard|last2=Horodecki|first2=Paweł|last3=Horodecki|first3=Michał|last4=Horodecki|first4=Karol|date=2009-06-17|title=Quantum entanglement|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=81|issue=2|pages=865–942|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.865|bibcode=2009RvMP...81..865H|arxiv=quant-ph/0702225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum computing is often used for scientific research where a normal computer does not have nearly enough computational power to do the calculations necessary. A good example would be [[Molecular modelling|molecular modeling]]. Large molecules are far too complex for modern computers to calculate what happens to them during a reaction, but the power of quantum computers could open the doors to further understanding these molecules.
