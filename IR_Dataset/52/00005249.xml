'''Crony capitalism''' is an [[economy|economic system]] in which businesses thrive not as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the [[political class]]. This is often achieved by using state power rather than competition in managing permits, government grants, [[tax break]]s, or other forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/publications/policy-magazine/article/2877-feature-crony-capitalism-and-the-east-asian-currency-and-financial-crises|author=Helen Hughes|volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Spring 1999|title=Crony Capitalism and the East Asian Currency and Financial 'Crises'|magazine=Policy|quote=Japan's dismal performance in the 1990s and the East Asian collapses of 1997 indicate that [[dirigisme]] can only boost economies in the short run and at high cost.

Money is then made not merely by making a profit in the market, but through profiteering by [[Rent-seeking|rent seeking]] using this [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]]. [[Entrepreneurship]] and innovative practices which seek to reward risk are stifled since the value-added is little by crony businesses, as hardly anything of significant value is created by them, with transactions taking the form of trading. Crony capitalism spills over into the government, the politics, and the media,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism, 1981&quot;&gt;''The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism'', by McCormick, Richard. 1981. The American Historical Review, Vol. 86, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 247–74.&lt;/ref&gt; when this nexus distorts the economy and affects society to an extent it corrupts [[Public good (economics)|public-serving]] economic, political, and social ideals.

== Historical usage ==
The first extensive use of the term &quot;crony capitalism&quot; came about in the 1980s, to characterize the [[Philippine economy under Ferdinand Marcos|Philippine economy under the dictatorship]] of [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name=Caroline&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.grips.ac.jp/~esp/en/event/what-is-%E2%80%9Ccrony-capitalism%E2%80%9D/ |title=What is 'Crony Capitalism'? |last=Hau  |first=Caroline S. |website=Emerging State Project |publisher=[[National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies]] |location=Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses of this term to describe the economic practices of the Marcos regime included that of [[Ricardo Manapat]], who introduced it in his 1979 pamphlet &quot;Some are Smarter than Others,&quot; which was later published in 1991&lt;ref name=Caroline/&gt;; former ''Time'' magazine business editor George M. Taber, who used the term in a ''Time'' magazine article in 1980&lt;ref name=Caroline/&gt;, and activist (and later Finance Minister) [[Jaime Ongpin]], who used the term extensively in his writing and is sometimes credited for having coined it.&lt;ref name=&quot;BantayogProfileOngpinJaimeV&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bantayog.org/ongpin-jaime/ |title=Heroes and Martyrs: ONGPIN, Jaime V. |date=May 26, 2016 |website=Bantayog ng mga Bayani  |access-date=July 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term crony capitalism made a significant impact in the public as an explanation of the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cronycapitalismc0000kang|title=Crony Capitalism: Corruption and Development in South Korea and the Philippines|last=Kang|first=David C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-521-00408-4|location=Cambridge|quote=Focused only on explaining successful outcomes, the conventional model provided no analytic way to explain the 1997 crisis. Countries previously regarded as miracles now were nothing more than havens for crony capitalists (p. 3)|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also used to describe governmental decisions favoring cronies of governmental officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cover-Story/Crony-capital-How-Duterte-embraced-the-oligarchs |title=Crony capital: How Duterte embraced the oligarchs |access-date=2020-01-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204170146/https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cover-Story/Crony-capital-How-Duterte-embraced-the-oligarchs |archive-date=2019-12-04 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term is often used comparatively with [[corporate welfare]], a technical term often used to assess government bailouts and favoritistic monetary policy as opposed to the economic theory described by crony capitalism. The extent of difference between these terms is whether a government action can be said to benefit the individual rather than the industry.

== In practice ==
Crony capitalism exists along a continuum. In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of collusion among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front (sometimes called a trade association or [[industry trade group]]) to the government in requesting subsidies or aid or regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/uber-vs-washington-dc-this-is-insane/259614/|title=Uber vs. Washington, D.C.: This Is Insane|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012|quote=a fight over a new competitor to the District's (often horrible) taxi service offers something I haven't seen in a while. Not routine retail-level corruption, nor skillful top-level favor trading, but instead what appears to be a blatant attempt to legislate favors for one set of interests by hamstringing another.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, newcomers to a market then need to surmount significant barriers to entry in seeking loans, acquiring shelf space, or receiving official sanction. Some such systems are very formalized, such as sports leagues and the Medallion System of the [[taxicabs of New York City]], but often the process is more subtle, such as expanding training and certification exams to make it more expensive for new entrants to enter a market and thereby limiting potential competition. In technological fields, there may evolve a system whereby new entrants may be accused of infringing on patents that the established competitors never assert against each other. In spite of this, some competitors may succeed when the legal [[Barriers to entry|barriers]] are light.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The term crony capitalism is generally used when these practices either come to dominate the economy as a whole, or come to dominate the most valuable industries in an economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20140327&quot;/&gt; Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business activity, but in practice they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides an incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. Troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have these laws suddenly enforced against them, leading to fines or even jail time. Even in high-income democracies with well-established legal systems and freedom of the press in place, a larger state is generally associated with increased political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013). [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf &quot;Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction&quot;].

The term crony capitalism was initially applied to states involved in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] such as Thailand and Indonesia. In these cases, the term was used to point out how family members of the ruling leaders become extremely wealthy with no non-political justification.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Southeast Asian nations still score very poorly in rankings measuring this. Hong Kong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Stephen|title=Why Hong Kong's latest No 1 ranking was greeted with silence|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/1462317/why-hong-kongs-latest-no-1-ranking-was-greeted-silence|accessdate=April 4, 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1213&amp;context=facultyworkingpapers&lt;/ref&gt; are perhaps most noted for this, and the term has also been applied to the system of [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/2668298?story_id=E1_NGGRNJR |title=Having it both ways |work=The Economist |date=May 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The countries where politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet|accessdate=April 4, 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not list every country in the world, just the ones that are both corrupt AND capitalist enough.

Many prosperous nations have also had varying amounts of cronyism throughout their history, including the United Kingdom especially in the 1600s and 1700s, the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20140327&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet |title=Planet Plutocrat: The countries where politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper |work=The Economist |date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.

=== Crony capitalism index ===
''[[The Economist]]'' benchmarks countries based on a [[crony-capitalism index]] calculated via how much economic activity occurs in industries prone to cronyism. Its 2014 Crony Capitalism Index ranking listed Hong Kong, Russia and Malaysia in the top three spots.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;/&gt;

== In finance ==
Crony capitalism in finance was found in the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. It was a private company, but its largest stockholder was the federal government which owned 20%. It was an early bank regulator and grew to be one being the most powerful organizations in the country due largely to being the depository of the government's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] in 1999 completely removed [[Glass–Steagall legislation|Glass–Steagall]]’s separation between commercial banks and investment banks. After this repeal, commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies combined their [[lobbying]] efforts. Critics claim this was instrumental in the passage of the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In sections of an economy ==
More direct government involvement in a specific sector can also lead to specific areas of crony capitalism, even if the economy as a whole may be competitive. This is most common in natural resource sectors through the granting of mining or drilling concessions, but it is also possible through a process known as [[regulatory capture]] where the government agencies in charge of regulating an industry come to be controlled by that industry. Governments will often establish in good faith [[regulatory agency|government agencies to regulate an industry]]. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of that regulatory body while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected. As a result, it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the watchdog and to use it against competitors. This typically takes the form of making it very expensive for a new entrant to enter the market. An [[Gibbons v. Ogden#Background|1824 landmark United States Supreme Court ruling]] overturned a New York State-granted monopoly (&quot;a veritable model of state munificence&quot; facilitated by [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]) for the then-revolutionary technology of [[North River Steamboat|steamboats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=T.J. |last=Styles |title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt|isbn=978-0-375-41542-5|quote=Property requirements for suffrage under New York's constitution of 1777 hardened the culture of rank into law. Two distinct levels of wealth were required to vote, one for state assembly, and a second and higher level for the state senators and governor... [this [[suffrage]] scheme fostered] [[mercantilism]], which in the state empowered private parties to carry out activities thought to serve the public interest. The standard reward for such an undertaking was a monopoly—just what Chancellor Livingston sought when he offered to meet a most pressing public need, the need for steamboats...Livingston maneuvered...the monopoly through the legislature (&quot;a veritable model of state munificence,&quot; as legal scholar Maurice G. Baxter writes—that gave him the right to seize steamboats the entered New York waters from other states. But Livingston had overreached. With so many inventors and investors interested in the steamboat, the monopoly on served to limit its adoption.  The new technology was simply too important for the monopoly to remain unchallenged. [pp. 39–42]|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging the Supreme Court's establishment of Congressional supremacy over commerce, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] was established in 1887 with the intent of regulating railroad [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]. President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed [[Thomas M. Cooley]], a railroad ally, as its first chairman and a permit system was used to deny access to new entrants and legalize [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Lee |title=Entangling the Web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03lee.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense industry in the United States is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry. Connections with [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] and lobbyists in Washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts. In the [[United States–European Union relations#Boeing and Airbus subsidies|Airbus-Boeing WTO dispute]], Airbus (which receives outright [[subsidy|subsidies]] from European governments) has stated Boeing receives similar subsidies which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Boeing Out of a Tailspin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862121_mz029.htm |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |quote=A national treasure, once No. 1 in commercial aviation, Boeing has become a risk-averse company stumbling to compete in the marketplace and dependent on political connections and chicanery to get government contracts.

Gerald P. O'Driscoll, former vice president at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], stated that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] became examples of crony capitalism as government backing let Fannie and Freddie dominate [[mortgage underwriting]], saying. &quot;The politicians created the mortgage giants, which then returned some of the profits to the pols—sometimes directly, as campaign funds; sometimes as &quot;contributions&quot; to favored constituents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |work=New York Post |title=Fannie/Freddie Bailout Baloney |first=Gerald P. |last=O'Driscoll Jr |date=September 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913195535/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In developing economies ==
In its worst form, crony capitalism can devolve into simple corruption where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with. Bribes to government officials are considered ''de rigueur'' and [[tax evasion]] is common. This is seen in many parts of Africa and is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).

Corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others. This may also be done with, religious, or ethnic favoritism. For instance, [[Alawites]] in Syria have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there ([[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] himself is an Alawite).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01makhlouf.html Syrian Businessman Becomes Magnet for Anger and Dissent] &quot;Like Mr. Ezz in Egypt, he has become a symbol of how economic reforms turned crony socialism into crony capitalism, making the poor poorer and the connected rich fantastically wealthier.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by considering personal relationships as a [[social network]]. As government and business leaders try to accomplish various things, they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors. These people form hubs in the network. In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.

Normally, this will be untenable to maintain in business as new entrants will affect the market. However, if business and government are entwined, then the government can maintain the small-hub network.

[[Raymond Vernon]], specialist in economics and international affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|title=Raymond Vernon Dies at 85|date=September 23, 1999|work=The Harvard University Gazette|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=February 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503203741/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|archivedate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Great Britain because they were the first to successfully limit the power of veto groups (typically cronies of those with power in government) to block innovations,&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; writing: &quot;Unlike most other national environments, the British environment of the early 19th century contained relatively few threats to those who improved and applied existing inventions, whether from business competitors, labor, or the government itself.  In other European countries, by contrast, the merchant guilds [...] were a pervasive source of veto for many centuries. This power was typically bestowed upon them by government&quot;. For example, a Russian inventor produced a steam engine in 1766 and disappeared without a trace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Vermon further stated that &quot;a steam powered horseless carriage produced in France in 1769 was officially suppressed&quot;. [[James Watt]] began experimenting with steam in 1763, got a patent in 1769 and began commercial production in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989, p. 8); see also [[Watt steam engine]] and [[James Watt#Patents|James Watt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raghuram Rajan]], former governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], has said: &quot;One of the greatest dangers to the growth of developing countries is the [[middle income trap]], where crony capitalism creates oligarchies that slow down growth. If the debate during the elections is any pointer, this is a very real concern of the public in India today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crony capitalism a big threat to countries like India, RBI chief Raghuram Rajan says|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Crony-capitalism-a-big-threat-to-countries-like-India-RBI-chief-Raghuram-Rajan-says/articleshow/40076743.cms|accessdate=November 6, 2014|work=The Times of India|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tavleen Singh]], columnist for ''[[The Indian Express]]'', has disagreed. According to Singh, India's corporate success is not a product of crony capitalism, but because India is no longer under the influence of crony socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/no-crony-capitalism-in-india/821341/|title=No crony capitalism in India – Indian Express|website=The Indian Express|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political viewpoints ==
{{misleading|date=May 2016}}
While the problem is generally accepted across the political spectrum, ideology shades the view of the problem's causes and therefore its solutions. Political views mostly fall into two camps which might be called the socialist and capitalist critique. The socialist position is that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of any strictly capitalist system and thus broadly democratic government must regulate economic, or wealthy, interests to restrict monopoly. The capitalist position is that [[natural monopolies]] are rare, therefore governmental regulations generally abet established wealthy interests by restricting competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |title=Uber Driving Down Price of Taxi Medallions |accessdate=January 8, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083819/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critique ===
Critics of crony capitalism including [[socialism|socialists]] and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]] often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of any strictly capitalist system. [[Jane Jacobs]] described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing [[power (sociology)|power]] and trade while [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that the word crony is superfluous when describing capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081114.htm &quot;Black Faces in Limousines:&quot; A Conversation with Noam Chomsky] from Chomsky.info. Retrieved June 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since businesses make money and money leads to political power, business will inevitably use their power to influence governments. Much of the impetus behind [[campaign finance reform in the United States]] and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power.

[[Ravi Batra]] argues that &quot;all official economic measures adopted since 1981 ... have devastated the middle class&quot; and that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement should push for their repeal and thus end the influence of the super wealthy in the political process which he considers a manifestation of crony capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474 |title=The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism |first=Ravi |last=Batra |publisher=[[Truthout]] |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013183247/http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474 |archive-date=October 13, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist economists, such as [[Robin Hahnel]], have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Let's Review |url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/bpn/znet/april08.txt |author=Robin Hahnel |quote=IMF officials Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer were quick to explain that the afflicted economies had only themselves to blame. Crony capitalism, lack of transparency, accounting procedures not up to international standards, and weak-kneed politicians too quick to spend and too afraid to tax were the problems according to IMF and US Treasury Department officials. The fact that the afflicted economies had been held up as paragons of virtue and IMF/World Bank success stories only a year before, the fact that neoliberalism's only success story had been the Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC's) who were now in the tank, and the fact that the IMF and Treasury department story just didn't fit the facts since the afflicted economies were no more rife with crony capitalism, lack of transparency, and weak-willed politicians than dozens of other economies untouched by the Asian financial crisis, simply did not matter. |author-link=Robin Hahnel |access-date=2011-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910183553/http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/bpn/znet/april08.txt |archive-date=2006-09-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist economists dismiss the term as an [[apologetic]] for failures of [[neoliberal]] policy and more fundamentally their perception of the weaknesses of market allocation.

Even if the initial regulation was well-intentioned (to curb actual abuses) and even if the initial lobbying by corporations was well-intentioned (to reduce illogical regulations), the mixture of business and government stifle competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Take the &quot;Crony&quot; Out of &quot;Crony Capitalism&quot;|url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/john-stossel/let-s-take-the-crony-out-of-crony-capitalism.html|accessdate=November 26, 2011|quote=Which are more likely to be hampered by vigorous regulatory standards: entrenched corporations with their overstaffed legal and accounting departments or small startups trying to get off the ground?

[[Burton W. Folsom Jr.]] distinguishes those that engage in crony capitalism—designated by him political entrepreneurs—from those who compete in the marketplace without special aid from government, whom he calls market entrepreneurs. The market entrepreneurs such as [[James J. Hill]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]] succeeded by producing a quality product at a competitive price. For example, the political entrepreneurs such as [[Edward Knight Collins|Edward Collins]] in steamships and the leaders of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in railroads were men who used the power of government to succeed. They tried to gain subsidies or in some way use government to stop competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth of the Robber Barons|url=http://www.burtfolsom.com/?page_id=29|accessdate=November 28, 2011|quote=The author, Burton Folsom, divides the entrepreneurs into two groups:  market entrepreneurs and political entrepreneurs.|last1=Folsom|first1=Burton|authorlink=Burton W.
