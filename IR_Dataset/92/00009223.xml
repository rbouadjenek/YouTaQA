Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] and how [[economy|economies]] work. [[Microeconomics]] analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and [[market (economics)|markets]], their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. [[Macroeconomics]] analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, saving, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), [[inflation]], [[economic growth]], and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies).  See [[glossary of economics]].

Other broad distinctions within economics include those between [[positive economics]], describing &quot;what is&quot;, and [[normative economics]], advocating &quot;what ought to be&quot;; between economic theory and [[applied economics]]; between [[Rational choice theory|rational]] and [[behavioural economics]]; and between [[mainstream economics]] and [[heterodox economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Andrew |editor-last1=Caplin |editor-first2=Andrew |editor-last2=Schotter |title=The Foundations of Positive and Normative Economics: A Handbook |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-532831-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2d8SFFyeNEC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The term and its various definitions ==

The discipline was renamed in the late 19th century, primarily due to [[Alfred Marshall]], from &quot;[[political economy]]&quot; to &quot;economics&quot; as a shorter term for &quot;economic science&quot;. At that time, it became more open to rigorous thinking and made increased use of mathematics, which helped support efforts to have it accepted as a science and as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.{{efn|The term ''economics'' is derived from ''economic science'', and the word ''economic'' is perhaps shortened from ''economical'' or derived from the French word ''économique'' or directly from the Latin word ''oeconomicus'' &quot;of domestic economy&quot;. This in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἰκονομικός}} (''oikonomikos''), &quot;practiced in the management of a household or family&quot; and therefore &quot;frugal, thrifty&quot;, which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἰκονομία|οἰκονομία]]}} (''oikonomia'') &quot;household management&quot; which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἶκος|οἶκος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|oikos}}'' &quot;house&quot;) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|nomos}}'', &quot;custom&quot; or &quot;law&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Harper |title=Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Economy |date=February 2007 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=economic |accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Free2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Free|editor-first=Rhona C. |title=21st Century Economics: A Reference Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRFadIRMaMsC&amp;pg=PA8 |volume=Volume 1 |year=2010 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-6142-4 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallMarshall1888&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=Alfred |authorlink1=Alfred Marshall |last2=Marshall |first2=Mary Paley |authorlink2=Mary Paley Marshall |title=The Economics of Industry |url=https://archive.org/details/economicsindust00marsgoog |year=1888 |publisher=Macmillan |page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsindust00marsgoog/page/n22 2]|orig-year=1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jevons1879&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |authorlink=William Stanley Jevons |title=The Theory of Political Economy |url=https://archive.org/details/theorypolitical00jevogoog |edition=second |year=1879 |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people&amp;nbsp;... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groenwegen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Smith |date=1776 |title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|title-link=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations }} and Book IV, as quoted in {{cite encyclopedia |first=Peter |last=Groenwegen |date=2008 |pages=476–480 |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume  |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000114 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1300 |chapter=Political Economy |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1803), distinguishing the subject from its [[public policy|public-policy]] uses, defines it as the science ''of'' production, distribution, and consumption of [[wealth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Say1803&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Say|first=Jean Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Say|title=A Treatise on Political Economy|year=1803|publisher=Grigg and Elliot|ref=harv|title-link=Say's Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[satirical]] side, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1849) coined &quot;[[the dismal science]]&quot; as an [[Epithet#Alternative contemporary usage|epithet]] for [[classical economics]], in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of [[Malthus]] (1798).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dismal&quot;&gt;• {{cite magazine |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Carlyle |date=1849 |title=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question |magazine=[[Fraser's Magazine]] |title-link=Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Malthus |first=Thomas Robert |author-link=Thomas Robert Malthus |date=1798 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |publisher=J.

{{quote|text=The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|title=Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4TxQqkP40fYC&amp;pg=PA99|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo|isbn=978-1-60206-978-7|chapter=On the Definition of Political Economy; and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It|orig-year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alfred Marshall]] provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' (1890) that extends analysis beyond [[Economic wealth|wealth]] and from the [[societal]] to the [[microeconomic]] level:

{{quote|text=Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Alfred|authorlink=Alfred Marshall|title=Principles of Economics|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesecono00marsgoog|year=1890|publisher=Macmillan and Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesecono00marsgoog/page/n196 1]–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Lionel Robbins]] (1932) developed implications of what has been termed &quot;[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;BackhouseMedema2009&quot;/&gt;

{{quote |text=Economics is a science which studies [[human behaviour]] as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nySoIkOgWQ4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2007|orig-year=1932|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=978-1-61016-039-1|page=15|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robbins describes the definition as not ''classificatory'' in &quot;pick[ing] out certain ''kinds'' of behaviour&quot; but rather ''analytical'' in &quot;focus[ing] attention on a particular ''aspect'' of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of [[scarcity]].&quot;{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow.{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|pp=4–7}} But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus.  This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after '''end'''), generates both cost and benefits; and, '''resources''' (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal.  If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding '''actors''' (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a '''decision''') but rather explore other alternatives. We cannot define economics as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end).

Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and [[rational choice|rational-choice]] modelling [[Economic imperialism (economics)|expanded the domain]] of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backhouse2009Stigler&quot;&gt;• {{cite journal |last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E. |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |date=October 2009 |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |volume=76 |issue=s1 |pages=805–820 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |author-link=George J.

[[Gary Becker]], a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, describes the approach he favours as &quot;combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable [[preference (economics)|preferences]], and [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]], used relentlessly and unflinchingly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|title=The Economic Approach to Human Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwEOFKSKbMgC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-04112-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the &quot;choice process and the type of [[social interaction]] that [such] analysis involves.&quot; The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.&lt;ref name=BackhouseMedema2009/&gt;

Two groups, who later were called &quot;mercantilists&quot; and &quot;physiocrats&quot;, more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of [[economic nationalism]] and [[History of capitalism#Merchant capitalism and mercantilism|modern capitalism]] in Europe. [[Mercantilism]] was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |title=Mercantilism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=26 August 2016 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mercantilism}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Blaug|2017|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physiocrats]], a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a [[circular flow]] of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of ''[[laissez-faire]]'', which called for minimal government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |title=Physiocrat|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=7 March 2014 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/physiocrat}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=Economic Theory in Retrospect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nd6alor2goC&amp;pg=PA24|edition=fifth|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57701-4|pages=24–29, 82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of Adam Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, has been described as &quot;the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline.&quot;{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=343}} The book identified land, labour, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation's wealth, as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive.

Smith discusses potential benefits of specialization by [[division of labour]], including increased [[labour productivity]] and [[gains from trade]], whether between town and country or across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Alan Deardorff |last=Deardorff |first=Alan V. |date=2016 |title=Division of labor |website=Deardorffs' Glossary of International Economics |publisher=University of Michigan |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/d.html#DivisionOfLabor}}&lt;/ref&gt; His &quot;theorem&quot; that &quot;the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market&quot; has been described as the &quot;core of a [[Theory of the firm|theory of the functions of firm]] and [[industrial organization|industry]]&quot; and a &quot;fundamental principle of economic organization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=George J.

The [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1798) used the concept of [[diminishing returns]] to explain low living standards. [[Human population]], he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malthus |first=Thomas |date=1798 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |publisher=J.

While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income, [[David Ricardo]] (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of [[comparative advantage]], according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower ''relative'' cost of production, rather relying only on its own production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Ricardo |date=1817 |title=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation |publisher=John Murray|title-link=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been termed a &quot;fundamental analytical explanation&quot; for [[gains from trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Ronald Findlay |first=Ronald |last=Findlay |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000254 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0274|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=28–33 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Comparative advantage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming at the end of the classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1848 |title=Principles of Political Economy |publisher=John W. Parker Publisher|title-link=Principles of Political Economy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the &quot;real price of every thing&amp;nbsp;... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it&quot;. Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity.{{sfnp|Smith|1776|loc=Bk. 1, Ch. 5, 6}} Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the '[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]'. Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a [[Steady-state economy#The stationary state in classical economics|final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size]].

Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics and it derives from the work of [[Karl Marx]]. The first volume of Marx's major work, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the [[labour theory of value]] and the [[theory of surplus value]] which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roemer&quot;&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=John Roemer |last=Roemer |first=J.E. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman  |p=383 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001420 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3052|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marxian value analysis }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Ernest Mandel |last=Mandel |first=Ernest |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pp=372, 376 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001419 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3051|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marx, Karl Heinrich (1818–1883) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created.&lt;ref name=&quot;THOMAS FULLER&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/asia/18laos.html |work=The New York Times|first=Thomas |last=Fuller|title=Communism and Capitalism Are Mixing in Laos|date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoclassical economics ===
{{Main|Neoclassical economics}}

At the dawn as a social science, '''economics''' was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his ''Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth'' (1803). These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution.{{efn|&quot;This science indicates the cases in which commerce is truly productive, where whatever is gained by one is lost by another, and where it is profitable to all; it also teaches us to appreciate its several processes, but simply in their results, at which it stops. Besides this knowledge, the merchant must also understand the processes of his art. He must be acquainted with the commodities in which he deals, their qualities and defects, the countries from which they are derived, their markets, the means of their transportation, the values to be given for them in exchange, and the method of keeping accounts. The same remark is applicable to the agriculturist, to the manufacturer, and to the practical man of business; to acquire a thorough knowledge of the causes and consequences of each phenomenon, the study of political economy is essentially necessary to them all; and to become expert in his particular pursuit, each one must add thereto a knowledge of its processes.&quot; {{harv|Say|1803|page=XVI}} }} Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word &quot;wealth&quot; for &quot;goods and services&quot; meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]] noticed that this definition no longer sufficed,{{efn|&quot;And when we submit the definition in question to this test, it is seen to possess deficiencies which, so far from being marginal and subsidiary, amount to nothing less than a complete failure to exhibit either the scope or the significance of the most central generalisations of all.&quot;{{harv|Robbins|2007|p=5}} }} because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity,{{efn|&quot;The conception we have adopted may be described as analytical. It does not attempt to pick out certain kinds of behaviour, but focuses attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity. {{harv|Robbins|2007|p=17}} }} which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science.&quot;  Citing Robbins: &quot;Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses&quot;.{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Defining Economics: the Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |first1=Roger E. |last1=Backhouse |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |work=Lionel Robbins's essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, 75th anniversary conference proceedings |date=10 December 2007 |pp=209–230 |url=http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/LionelRobbinsConferenceProveedingsVolume.pdf#page=213 |ref=harv}} also published in {{cite journal |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |date=October 2009 |volume=76 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=805–820 |jstor=40268907 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x|last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E |last2=Medema |first2=Steve G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition.{{sfnp|Backhouse|Medema|2007|page=223|ps=: &quot;There remained division over whether economics was defined by a method or a subject matter but both sides in that debate could increasingly accept some version of the Robbins definition.&quot;}} Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.

A body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; or &quot;[[Marginalist Revolution|marginalism]]&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularized by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for &quot;economic science&quot; and a substitute for the earlier &quot;[[political economy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallMarshall1888&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jevons1879&quot;/&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Barry |title=Political Economy: A Comparative Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wpiDzS45PsC&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=second |year=1998 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-95869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics systematized [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] inherited from classical economics in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Campos |first=Antonietta |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |volume=III |p=320 |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001393 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3031|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marginalist economics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of [[ordinal utility]], which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=R.D. Collison |last=Black |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000047 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1781|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=577–581 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Utility }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping [[decision making]]. An immediate example of this is the [[consumer theory]] of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks&quot;/&gt; In [[macroeconomics]] it is reflected in an early and lasting [[neoclassical synthesis]] with Keynesian macroeconomics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchard2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=John Hicks |last=Hicks |first=J.R. |date=April 1937 |title=Mr. Keynes and the &quot;Classics&quot;: A Suggested Interpretation |journal=Econometrica |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=147–159 |jstor=1907242 |doi=10.2307/1907242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as ''orthodox economics'' whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern [[mainstream economics]] builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as [[econometrics]], [[game theory]], analysis of [[market failure]] and [[imperfect competition]], and the [[neoclassical model]] of [[economic growth]] for analysing long-run variables affecting [[national income]].

Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of [[individual]]s, [[household]]s, and [[organization]]s (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use [[Scarcity|scarce]] resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a [[Decision theory|decision]] (choice) is made by one or more resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Leigh |last=Tesfatsion |title=Agent-Based Computational Economics: Growing Economies from the Bottom Up |journal=[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]] |date=Winter 2002 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=55–82 |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acealife.pdf |pmid=12020421 |doi=10.1162/106454602753694765|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.4605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the focus of economic analysis.{{efn|See [[Agent-based computational economics]]}}

An approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity, may go as follows:

The continuous interplay (exchange or trade) done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, as well as the remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent).{{efn|Interest payments are considered a form of rent on credit money.}} Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.{{efn|See [[Complex adaptive system]] and [[Dynamic network analysis]]}}

Keynesian economics has two successors. [[Post-Keynesian economics]] also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]] and the work of [[Joan Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Harcourt |first=G.C. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=47–50 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001728 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3307|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Post-Keynesian economics |url=http://www.e-elgar.com/shop/isbn/9781852788018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New-Keynesian economics]] is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones.

=== Chicago school of economics ===
{{Main|Chicago school of economics}}

The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to [[Milton Friedman]] and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. [[Ben Bernanke]], former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;fed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|date=8 November 2002|first=Ben |last=Bernanke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and modernized them. One example of this is his article in the 13 September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times Magazine'', in which he claims that the social responsibility of business should be &quot;to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits&amp;nbsp;... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=13 September 1970 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the [[Austrian School]], the [[Freiburg School]], the [[School of Lausanne]], [[post-Keynesian economics]] and the [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm school]]. Contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern]] and [[West coast of the United States|Western]] coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago-school approach.

Economic systems is the [[JEL classification codes#Economic systems JEL: P Subcategories|branch]] of economics that studies the methods and [[institutions]] by which societies determine the ownership, direction, and allocation of economic resources. An ''economic system'' of a society is the unit of analysis.

Among contemporary systems at different ends of the organizational spectrum are [[Planned economy|socialist systems]] and [[Capitalism|capitalist systems]], in which most production occurs in respectively state-run and private enterprises.

== Theory ==

Mainstream economic theory relies upon ''[[wikt:a priori|a priori]]'' quantitative [[model (economics)|economic models]], which employ a variety of concepts. Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration. When creating theories, the objective is to find ones which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Milton |date=1953 |chapter=[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]] |title=Essays in Positive Economics |publisher=University of Chicago Press |p=10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economic theory constitutes both the dominant or orthodox theoretical as well as [[General equilibrium theory|methodological framework]], economic theory can also take the form of other [[Schools of economic thought|schools of thought]] such as in [[heterodox economics|heterodox economic theories]].

In [[microeconomics]], principal concepts include [[supply and demand]], [[marginalism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[opportunity cost]], [[budget constraint]]s, [[utility]], and the [[theory of the firm]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Boland |first=Lawrence A. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=455–458 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001456 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3083|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Methodology }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |title=Consensus and Dissension among Economists: An Empirical Inquiry |last1=Frey |first1=Bruno S. |last2=Pommerehne |first2=Werner W. |last3=Schneider |first3=Friedrich |last4=Gilbert |first4=Guy |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |issn=0002-8282 |volume=74 |issue=5 |date=December 1984 |pages=986–994 |jstor=557 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[macroeconomic]] models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables, but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists, including [[new Keynesian]]s, reformulated their models in [[microfoundations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon2008&quot;/&gt;

The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play a major part in macroeconomic models&amp;nbsp;– for instance, in [[monetary theory]], the [[quantity theory of money]] predicts that increases in the growth rate of the [[money supply]] increase [[inflation]], and inflation is assumed to be influenced by [[rational expectations]]. In [[development economics]], slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital, and this has been observed in the [[Four Asian Tigers]]. Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only ''[[qualitative economics|qualitative]]'', not ''quantitative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Quirk |first=James |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=IV |pp=1–3 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001811 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3369|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Qualitative economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, [[Paul Samuelson]]'s treatise ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' (1947) used mathematical methods beyond graphs to represent the theory, particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called ''operationally meaningful theorems'' in economics, which are [[theorem]]s that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundations of Economic Analysis, Enlarged Edition |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |origyear=1947 |year=1983 |page=[https://archive.org/details/foundationsofeco0000samu/page/4 4] |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-674-31301-9 |title-link=Foundations of Economic Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microeconomics examines how entities, forming a [[market structure]], interact within a [[Market (economics)|market]] to create a [[market system]]. These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light [[government regulation]].{{clarify|date=July 2017}} The item traded may be a tangible [[product (business)|product]] such as apples or a [[Service (economics)|service]] such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.

In theory, in a [[free market]] the [[Aggregation problem|aggregates]] (sum of) of ''quantity demanded'' by buyers and ''quantity supplied'' by sellers may reach [[economic equilibrium]] over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached may not necessarily be [[Equity (economics)|morally equitable]]. For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by [[exogenous|external factors]], the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it.

Various market structures exist. In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive markets]], no participants are large enough to have the [[market power]] to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a &quot;price taker&quot; as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience [[imperfect competition]].

Forms include [[monopoly]] (in which there is only one seller of a good), [[duopoly]] (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), [[monopolistic competition]] (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), [[monopsony]] (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and [[oligopsony]] (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be &quot;price makers&quot;, which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.

Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as [[supply and demand|partial-equilibrium]] analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. [[General equilibrium|General-equilibrium]] theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across ''all'' markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Blaug|2017|pp=347–349}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Hal R.

==== Production, cost, and efficiency ====
{{Main|Production (economics)|Opportunity cost|Economic efficiency|Production–possibility frontier}}

In microeconomics, [[Production (economics)|production]] is the conversion of [[factor of production|inputs]] into [[Output (economics)|outputs]]. It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a [[good (economics)|commodity]] or a service for [[trade|exchange]] or direct use. Production is a [[Stock and flow|flow]] and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. [[Investment#In economics or macroeconomics|investment goods]] (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) or [[private good]]s (new computers, bananas, etc.), and [[Guns versus butter model|&quot;guns&quot; vs &quot;butter&quot;]].

[[Opportunity cost]] is the [[economic cost]] of production: the value of the next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet [[mutually exclusive]] actions. It has been described as expressing &quot;the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[choice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=James M. Buchanan |last=Buchanan |first=James M. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman  |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001612 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3206|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Opportunity cost }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a baker uses a sack of flour to make pretzels one morning, then the baker cannot use either the flour or the morning to make bagels instead.  Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way.  The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|output forgone]], [[leisure]], or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ([[utility]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[The Economist]] Economics A-Z |url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=OPPORTUNITY+COST |title=Opportunity Cost |access-date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inputs used in the production process include such primary [[factors of production]] as [[Labour (economics)|labour services]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and [[Land (economics)|land]] (including natural resources). Other inputs may include [[intermediate good]]s used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.

[[Economic efficiency]] measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available [[technology]]. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of &quot;waste&quot; is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is [[Pareto efficiency]], which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|An example [[production–possibility frontier]] with illustrative points marked.]]

The [[production–possibility frontier]] (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an [[economy]] can produce just two goods (say &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;butter&quot;). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows [[Potential output|potential total output]] for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.

[[Scarcity]] is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume ''beyond the PPF'' (such as at ''X'') and by the negative slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montani |first=Guido |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001949 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3485|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Scarcity }}&lt;/ref&gt; If production of one good ''increases'' along the curve, production of the other good ''decreases'', an [[inverse relationship]]. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter.

The [[slope]] of the curve at a point on it gives the [[trade-off#Examples from common life|trade-off]] between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a ''real opportunity cost''. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. ''Along the PPF'', scarcity implies that choosing ''more'' of one good in the aggregate entails doing with ''less'' of the other good. Still, in a [[market economy]], movement along the curve may indicate that the [[utility|choice]] of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.

By construction, each point on the curve shows ''[[productive efficiency]]'' in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point ''inside'' the curve (as at ''A''), is feasible but represents ''production inefficiency'' (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of ''one or both goods'' could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high [[unemployment]] during a [[business cycle|business-cycle]] [[recession]] or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy [[allocative efficiency]] (also called [[Pareto efficiency]]) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.

Much [[applied economics]] in [[public policy]] is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the &quot;essence of economics&quot;, where the subject &quot;makes its unique contribution.&quot;{{sfnp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc= ch. 1, p. 5 (quotation) and sect. C,&quot;The Production-Possibility Frontier&quot;, pp. 9–15; ch. 2, &quot;Efficiency&quot; sect.; ch. 8, sect. D, &quot;The Concept of Efficiency}}

==== Specialization ====
{{Main|Division of labour|Comparative advantage|Gains from trade}}

[[File:Late Medieval Trade Routes.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|A map showing the main [[trade route]]s for goods within [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval Europe]].]]

Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and [[empirical]] considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in [[stock and flow|stocks]] of [[human capital]] per worker or [[capital (economics)|capital]]/[[labor force|labour]] ratios. According to theory, this may give a [[comparative advantage]] in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus ''relatively'' cheaper, input.

Even if one region has an [[absolute advantage]] as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.

It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of [[Returns to scale|scale]] and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration]] to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite journal |author-link=Paul Krugman |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=December 1980 |title=Scale Economies, Product Differentiation, and the Pattern of Trade |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=950–959 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/scale_econ.pdf |jstor=1805774}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |first=William C. |last=Strange |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000064 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1769|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=533–536 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Urban agglomeration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, [[Service (economics)|service]] providers, and [[economy|economies]]. Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding ''[[division of labour]]'' with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] and differentiated [[Land (economics)|land]] uses.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Groenewegen |first=Peter |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_D000176 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0401|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=517–526 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Division of labour }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Paul M. |date=2005 |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/specialization |title=Specialization |website=A Glossary of Political Economy Terms |publisher=Department of Political Science, [[Auburn University]]}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Xiaokai|last2=Ng|first2=Yew-Kwang|title=Specialization and Economic Organization: A New Classical Microeconomic Framework|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuG4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1993|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=978-0-444-88698-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.

Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market [[price]]s of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|low-cost]] inputs go to producing low-cost outputs.

==== Supply and demand ====
{{Main|Supply and demand}}

[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. The graph depicts an increase (that is, right-shift) in demand from D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).|alt=A graph depicting Quantity on the X-axis and Price on the Y-axis]]

[[Prices and quantities]] have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brody |first=A. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics  |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001748 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3325|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Prices and quantities }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In [[microeconomics]], it applies to price and output determination for a market with [[perfect competition]], which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting [[market power|power]].

For a given market of a [[Good (economics and accounting)|commodity]], ''demand'' is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). [[consumer theory|Demand theory]] describes individual consumers as [[rational choice theory|rationally]] choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is &quot;constrained utility maximization&quot; (with income and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] as the [[budget constraint|constraints]] on demand). Here, [[utility]] refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.

The [[law of demand]] states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things [[ceteris paribus|unchanged]]). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the [[substitution effect]]). In addition, [[purchasing power]] from the price decline increases ability to buy (the [[income effect]]). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a [[normal good]] outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.

''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be ''profit maximizers'', meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.

That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The &quot;Law of Supply&quot; states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.

[[Market equilibrium]] occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The [[Model (economics)|model]] of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.

==== Firms ====
{{Main|Theory of the firm|Industrial organization|Business economics|Managerial economics}}

People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through ''firms''. The most obvious kinds of firms are [[corporation]]s, [[partnerships]] and [[trusts]]. According to [[Ronald Coase]], people begin to organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald | author-link=Ronald Coase |year=1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=[[Economica]] |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=386–405 |jstor=2626876 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x|title-link=The Nature of the Firm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater [[economies of scale]] (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.

In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. [[Industrial organization]] generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price.

[[Managerial economics]] applies [[microeconomic]] analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as [[operations research]] and programming and from statistical methods such as [[regression analysis]] in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge.

[[Uncertainty]] in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as [[Risk#Risk versus uncertainty|risk]] or not.

[[Game theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] that considers [[Strategy#Strategies in game theory|strategic interactions]] between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical [[microfoundation|foundation]] of [[industrial organization]], discussed above, to model different types of firm behaviour, for example in an solipsistic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, [[Bargaining#Game theory|bargaining]], [[Contract theory|contract design]], and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. In [[behavioural economics]], it has been used to model the strategies [[Agent (economics)|agents]] choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own.&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 11, &quot;Uncertainty and Game Theory&quot; and [end] Glossary of Terms, &quot;Economics of information&quot;, &quot;Game theory&quot;, and &quot;Regulation&quot;}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Camerer |first=Colin F. |author-link=Colin F.

In this, it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the [[supply and demand]] model and allows for incomplete information of actors.

[[Risk aversion]] may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for [[insurance]], commodity [[futures market|futures contracts]], and [[financial instruments]].

Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on [[George Akerlof]]'s &quot;[[Market for Lemons]]&quot; article, the [[paradigm]] example is of a dodgy second-hand car market.

Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (&quot;[[incomplete markets]]&quot;). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard.

==== Market failure ====
{{Main|Market failure|Government failure|Information economics|Environmental economics|Agricultural economics}}

[[File:Smokestack in Detroit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Pollution]] can be a simple example of market failure. If [[costs of production]] are not borne by producers but are by the environment, accident victims or others, then prices are distorted.|alt=A smokestack releasing smoke]]

[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Environmental scientist]] sampling water|alt=A woman takes samples of water from a river.]]

The term &quot;[[market failure]]&quot; encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorize market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.{{efn|Compare with [[Nicholas Barr]] (2004), whose list of market failures is melded with failures of economic assumptions, which are (1) producers as price takers (i.e. presence of oligopoly or monopoly; but why is this not a product of the following?) (2) equal power of consumers (what labour lawyers call an imbalance of bargaining power) (3) complete markets (4) public goods (5) external effects (i.e. externalities?) (6) increasing returns to scale (i.e. practical monopoly) (7) perfect information (in {{cite book |title=The Economics of the Welfare State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWxfQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=4th |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926497-1 |pages=72–79}}).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (2015) classifies market failures as from failure of competition (including [[natural monopoly]]), [[information asymmetries]], [[incomplete markets]], [[externalities]], [[Public good (economics)|public good]] situations, and [[macroeconomic]] disturbances (in {{cite book |title=Economics of the Public Sector: Fourth International Student Edition |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miPeCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=4th |year=2015 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-93709-1 |pages=81–100 |chapter=Chapter 4: Market Failure}}).}}

[[Information asymmetries]] and [[incomplete markets]] may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.

[[Natural monopoly]], or the overlapping concepts of &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;technical&quot; monopoly, is an extreme case of ''failure of competition'' as a restraint on producers. Extreme [[economies of scale]] are one possible cause.

[[Public goods]] are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time.

[[Externalities]] occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price [[distortions (economics)|distortions]] caused by these externalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Jean-Jacques Laffont |last=Laffont |first=J.J. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=263–265 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000773 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2520|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Externalities }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.{{sfn|Blaug|2017|p=347}}

In many areas, some form of [[price stickiness]] is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the [[business cycle]] in [[macroeconomics]]. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets [[Imperfect competition|deviating]] from [[perfect competition]].

Some specialized fields of economics deal in market failure more than others. The [[economics of the public sector]] is one example. Much [[environmental economics]] concerns externalities or &quot;[[public bad]]s&quot;.

[[Policy]] options include regulations that reflect [[cost-benefit analysis]] or market solutions that change incentives, such as [[Emissions trading|emission fees]] or redefinition of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Kneese |first1=Allen K. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |first2=Clifford S. |last2=Russell |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=159–164 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000715 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2480|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Environmental economics }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 18, &quot;Protecting the Environment.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public finance is the field of economics that deals with [[budget]]ing the revenues and expenditures of a [[public sector]] entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as [[tax incidence]] (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]] of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of [[public choice theory]], models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Musgrave |first1=Richard A. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |author-link=Richard Musgrave (economist) |pp=1055–1060 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001795 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3360|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Public finance }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroeconomics ===
{{Main|Macroeconomics}}

[[File:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|thumb|[[Circular flow of income|The circulation of money in an economy]] in a macroeconomic model.]]

Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions &quot;top down&quot;, that is, using a simplified form of [[General equilibrium|general-equilibrium]] theory.{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=345}} Such aggregates include [[measures of national income and output|national income and output]], the [[unemployment rate]], and price [[inflation]] and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]].

Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to [[microfoundations|micro-based]] modelling of sectors, including [[rational expectations|rationality]] of players, [[Efficient market hypothesis|efficient use]] of market information, and [[imperfect competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Business Confidence and Depression Prevention: A Mesoeconomic Perspective |last=Ng |first=Yew-Kwang |authorlink=Yew-Kwang Ng |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |issn=0002-8282 |volume=82 |issue=2 |date=May 1992 |pages=365–371 |jstor=2117429}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Howitt |first=Peter M. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=  273–276 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001367 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3008|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Macroeconomics: Relations with microeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and [[economic growth|growth]] of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, [[Technological progress|technological change]] and [[labour force]] growth.{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=349}}

==== Growth ====
{{Main|Economic growth}}

''Growth economics'' studies factors that explain [[economic growth]]&amp;nbsp;– the increase in output ''[[per capita]]'' of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the ''level'' of output ''per capita'' ''between'' countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries [[catch-up effect|converge]] at the same rates of growth.

Much-studied factors include the rate of [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment]], [[population growth]], and [[Technological progress|technological change]]. These are represented in theoretical and [[empirical]] forms (as in the [[neoclassical growth model|neoclassical]] and [[endogenous growth model|endogenous]] growth models) and in [[growth accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 27, &quot;The Process of Economic Growth&quot;}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Hirofumi Uzawa |last=Uzawa |first=H. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=483–489 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001477 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3097|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Models of growth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Economic cycle.svg|thumb|A basic illustration of [[Business cycle|economic/business cycles]].]]

The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of &quot;macroeconomics&quot; as a separate discipline. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] authored a book entitled ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' outlining the key theories of [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes contended that [[aggregate demand]] for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output.

He therefore advocated active policy responses by the [[public sector]], including [[monetary policy]] actions by the [[central bank]] and [[fiscal policy]] actions by the government to stabilize output over the [[business cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003  |page=396 |isbn=978-0-13-063085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards [[full employment]] levels. [[John Hicks]]' [[IS/LM]] model has been the most influential interpretation of ''The General Theory''.

Over the years, understanding of the [[business cycle]] has branched into various [[research program]]mes, mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The [[neoclassical synthesis]] refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with [[neoclassical economics]], stating that Keynesianism is correct in the [[short run]] but qualified by neoclassical-like considerations in the intermediate and [[long run]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchard2008&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Olivier J.

In contrast, the [[New Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of [[market failures]]. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are &quot;[[Sticky (economics)|sticky]]&quot;, which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon2008&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Dixon |first=Huw David |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000166 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1184|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=40–45 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=New Keynesian macroeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the &quot;long run&quot; may be very long.

==== Unemployment ====
{{Main|Unemployment}}

[[File:US employment 1995-2012.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The percentage of the [[Unemployment in the United States|US population employed]], 1995–2012.]]

The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or [[discouraged worker|discouraged from seeking work]] by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi443&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dwivedi|first=D. N.|title=Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1eFyp9Iku8C&amp;pg=PP1|year=2005|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-058841-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi443/&gt;

[[Structural unemployment]] covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Freeman |first=C. |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |date=2008 |edition=second|chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000311 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1641|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=64–66 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Structural unemployment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.{{sfnp|Dwivedi|2005|pp=444–445}}

While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. [[Okun's law]] represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth.{{sfnp|Dwivedi|2005|pp=445–446}} The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neely |first=Christopher J. |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1004.pdf |title=Okun's Law: Output and Unemployment |journal=Economic Synopses |volume=Number 4 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inflation and monetary policy ====
{{Main|Inflation|Monetary policy}}
{{See also|Money|Quantity theory of money|History of money}}

[[Money]] is a ''means of final payment'' for goods in most [[price system]] economies, and is the [[unit of account]] in which prices are typically stated. Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others. In the words of [[Francis Amasa Walker]], a well-known 19th-century economist, &quot;Money is what money does&quot; (&quot;Money is ''that'' money does&quot; in the original).&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker1891&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Amasa Walker|authorlink=Francis Amasa Walker|title=Money|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MJYSvaRqcwC|accessdate=5 November 2017|year=1878|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[medium of exchange]], money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with [[barter]] (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate [[double coincidence of wants]] as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the [[transaction cost]] of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=James Tobin |last=Tobin |first=James |date=1992 |title=Money (Money as a Social Institution and Public Good) |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Finance and Money |volume=Volume 2 |editor-first1=Peter K. |editor-last1=Newman |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=John |editor-last3=Eatwell |pp=770–771 |isbn=978-1-5615-9041-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0UOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of an [[economy]], [[quantity theory of money|theory]] and evidence are consistent with a [[positive relationship]] running from the total [[money supply]] to the [[nominal value]] of total output and to the general [[price level]]. For this reason, management of the [[money supply]] is a key aspect of [[monetary policy]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Friedman |first=Milton |author-link=Milton Friedman |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell  |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter K. |editor-last3=Newman

==== Fiscal policy ====
{{Main|Fiscal policy|Government spending|Taxation}}

Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an [[output gap]] where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government.

For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have [[Fiscal multiplier|multiplier effects]] where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity.

The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.

Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of [[Ricardian equivalence]]. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes.

{{Main|International economics}}

[[File:Countries by GDP (PPP) Per Capita in 2014.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita in 2014.]]

International trade studies determinants of goods-and-services flows across international boundaries. It also concerns the size and distribution of [[gains from trade]]. Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing [[tariff]] rates and trade quotas. [[International finance]] is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders, and the effects of these movements on [[exchange rate]]s. Increased trade in goods, services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Anderson |first=James E. |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_I000263 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0839|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=516–522 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=International trade theory }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{Cite book |last=Venables |first=A. |date=2001 |title=International Trade: Economic Integration |journal=[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]] |pages=7843–7848 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02259-2|isbn=9780080430768 }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |last=Obstfeld |first=Maurice |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_I000169 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0828|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=439–451 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=International finance }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development economics ===
{{main|Development economics}}

Development economics examines economic aspects of the [[economic development]] process in relatively [[developing countries|low-income countries]] focusing on [[structural change]], [[poverty]], and [[economic growth]]. Approaches in development economics frequently incorporate social and political factors.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Bell |first=Clive |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=1 |pp=818–826 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000565| doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2366|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Development economics }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Blaug|2017|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor economics ===
{{main|Labor economics}}

Labor economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the [[Market (economics)|markets]] for [[wage labor]]. '''Labor markets''' function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labor economics looks at the suppliers of labor services (workers), the demands of labor services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income.  In economics, '''labor'''  is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other [[factors of production]] as [[Land (economics)|land]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. There are theories which have developed a concept called [[human capital]] (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.

=== Welfare economics ===
{{main|Welfare economics}}

Welfare economics uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate [[well-being]] from [[Allocation of resources|allocation]] of [[factors of production|productive factors]] as to desirability and [[economic efficiency]] within an [[economy]], often relative to competitive [[general equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics'' (2006). [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/w.html#WelfareEconomics &quot;Welfare economics.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320065124/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/w.html |date=2017-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It analyzes ''social [[welfare]]'', however [[Social welfare function|measured]], in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered.  Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the [[methodological individualism|basic units]] for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no &quot;social welfare&quot; apart from the &quot;welfare&quot; associated with its individual units.

== Criticisms ==

=== General criticisms ===
&quot;[[The dismal science]]&quot; is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname &quot;the dismal science&quot; as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with John Stuart Mill on [[slavery]], in which Carlyle argued for slavery, while Mill opposed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dismal&quot;/&gt;

Some economists, like John Stuart Mill or [[Léon Walras]], have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routh |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Routh |title=The Origin of Economic Ideas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2KwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=second |year=1989 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-349-20169-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Wealth of Nations'', Adam Smith addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding. In Smith's day, these were referred to as [[Political faction|factions]], but are now more commonly called [[special interests]], a term which can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright oligopolies, monopolies, [[trade union]]s and other groups.{{efn|See {{cite web |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |author-link=Noam Chomsky |website=Understanding Power |title=Ruling the World |url=http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014032025/http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 October 2008 |date=14 October 2008}} on Smith's emphasis on class conflict in the Wealth of Nations.}}

Economics ''per se'', as a social science, is independent of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization; however, many [[policymaker]]s or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and [[rhetoric]] as vehicles to legitimize [[Political agenda|agendas]] and [[value systems]], and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;dismal science to get real&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sara |last1=Ledwith |first2=Antonella |last2=Ciancio |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-europe-economics-teaching-idUSBRE86207O20120703 |title=Special Report: Crisis Forces &quot;Dismal Science&quot; to get Real |work=[[Reuters]] |date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close relation of economic theory and practice with [[politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sirkku K. |last=Hellsten |chapter=Ethics, Rhetoric and Politics of Post-conflict Reconstruction How Can the Concept of Social Contract Help Us in Understanding How to Make Peace Work? |chapter-url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/rp2006-148.pdf |title=Making Peace Work |editor-first1=Tony |editor-last1=Addison |editor-first2=Tilman |editor-last2=Brück |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pp=75–100 |isbn=978-0-230-59519-4 |doi=10.1057/9780230595194|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hahn |first=Dan F. |title=Political Communication: Rhetoric, Government, and Citizens |url=http://www.stratapub.com/Hahn/preface.htm |edition=second |year=2003 |publisher=Strata |isbn=978-1-891136-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, economics legitimately has a role in informing government policy. It is, indeed, in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals have increased their efforts to gauge the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Often there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in one survey of [[American Economic Association]] economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.{{sfnp|Whaples|2009}}

=== Criticisms of assumptions ===
Economics has been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified assumptions, in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions. Examples of such assumptions include [[perfect information]], [[profit maximization]] and [[rational choice theory|rational choices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rappaport |first=Steven |date=28 July 1996 |title=Abstraction and Unrealistic Assumptions in Economics |journal=Journal of Economic Methodology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=215–236 |doi=10.1080/13501789600000016}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Rappaport |first=Steven |title=Models and Reality in Economics |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/modelsrealityine0000rapp |chapter-url-access=registration |year=1998 |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn=978-1-85898-575-6 |chapter=Chapter 6: Economic Models}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Friedman|1953|pages=14–15, 22, 31}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |last=Boland |first=Lawrence A. |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000231 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0067|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=267–270 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Assumptions controversy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[information economics]] includes both mathematical-economical research and also [[behavioural economics]], akin to studies in [[behavioural psychology]].&lt;ref name=Hodgson2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hodgson |first=Geoffrey M. |date=December 2007 |title=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics as the New Mainstream |journal=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=7–25 |doi=10.14441/eier.4.7|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, prominent mainstream economists such as Keynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keynes |first=J. M. |title=Alfred Marshall 1842–1924 |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=34 |issue=135 |pages=311–72 |date=September 1924 |jstor=2222645 |doi=10.2307/2222645}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on oligopoly research, [[Paul Joskow]] pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use &quot;informal models&quot; based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were &quot;trotted out ''[[ex post]]''&quot;. He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behaviour, was neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joskow |first=Paul |title=Firm Decision-making Policy and Oligopoly Theory |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=65 |issue=2, Papers and Proceedings of the Eighty–seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association |pages=270–279, esp. 271 |date=May 1975 |jstor=1818864 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading to the formation of [[feminist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=England |first=Paula |date=1993 |chapter=The Separative Self: Androcentric Bias in Neoclassical Assumptions |editor-last1=Ferber|editor-first1=Marianne A.|editor-last2=Nelson|editor-first2=Julie A. |title=Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ba9PmAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-24201-9 |pages=37–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a [[positive economics|positive]] and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] science, feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics&lt;ref name=&quot;beyond&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferber |first1=Marianne A. |last2=Nelson |first2=Julie A. |chapter=Introduction: ''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later |title=Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeWgyqLvmfsC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-24207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors ([[homo economicus]]); [[exogenous variable|exogenous]] tastes; the impossibility of utility comparisons; the exclusion of [[unpaid work]]; and the exclusion of class and gender considerations. [[Feminist economics]] developed to address these concerns, and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work, economic epistemology and history, globalization, household economics and the care economy. In 1988, [[Marilyn Waring]] published the book ''[[If Women Counted]]'', in which she argues that the discipline of economics ignores [[women's work|women's unpaid work]] and the value of [[nature]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marilyn |last=Waring |date=1988 |title=If Women Counted |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=978-0-06-250933-8|title-link=If Women Counted }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Julie A.

They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bjørnholt |first1=Margunn  |last2=McKay |first2=Ailsa |author2-link=Ailsa McKay |editor1-last=Bjørnholt |editor1-first =Margunn |editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt |editor2-last=McKay |editor2-first=Ailsa |editor2-link=Ailsa McKay |title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |chapter-url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf |year=2014 |publisher=Demeter Press |pages=7–20 |chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis |isbn=978-1-9273-3527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Mirowski]] observes that:

{{quote|The imperatives of the orthodox research programme [of economic science] leave little room for maneuver and less room for originality.&amp;nbsp;... These mandates&amp;nbsp;...

In a series of peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and books published over a period of several decades, [[John McMurtry (academic)|John McMurtry]] has provided extensive criticism of what he terms the &quot;unexamined assumptions and implications [of economics], and their consequent cost to people's lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McMurtryCancerStage&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McMurtry|first=John|title=The Cancer Stage of Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79G3Jsb2KYwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1999|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1347-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Please see partial list of publications, including peer-reviewed papers and books, on McMurtry's wikipedia page, as well as links to the text of several of his peer-reviewed papers and peer-reviewed secondary references analyzing and discussing his work.}}

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] and [[Michael Perelman (economist)|Michael Perelman]] are two additional scholars who criticized conventional or mainstream economics. Taleb opposes most economic theorizing, which in his view suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], and calls for cancellation of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Statistics|Statistical methods]] such as [[regression analysis]] are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and [[statistical significance]] (&quot;signal strength&quot;) of the hypothesized relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] hypothesis surviving tests.

In applied economics, [[input-output model]]s employing [[linear programming]] methods are quite common. Large amounts of data are run through computer programs to analyse the impact of certain policies; [[Minnesota IMPLAN Group|IMPLAN]] is one well-known example.

[[Experimental economics]] has promoted the use of [[Scientific control|scientifically controlled]] [[experiment]]s. This has reduced the long-noted distinction of economics from [[natural science]]s because it allows direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Bastable |first=C.F. |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=II |page=241 |chapter-url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000762 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2512|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |year=2008 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Experimental methods in economics (i) }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Vernon L.

In [[behavioural economics]], psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for his and [[Amos Tversky]]'s empirical discovery of several [[cognitive bias]]es and [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]. Similar empirical testing occurs in [[neuroeconomics]]. Another example is the assumption of narrowly selfish preferences versus a model that tests for selfish, altruistic, and cooperative preferences.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite journal |last1=Fehr |first1=Ernst |first2=Urs |last2=Fischbacher |date=23 October 2003 |title=The Nature of Human Altruism |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=425 |issue=6960 |pages=785–791 |doi=10.1038/nature02043|pmid=14574401 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |last1=Sigmund |first1=Karl |first2=Ernst |last2=Fehr |first3=Martin A. |last3=Nowak |date=January 2002 |title=The Economics of Fair Play |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=286 |issue=1 |pages=82–7 |pmid=11799620 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0102-82|bibcode=2002SciAm.286a..82S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques have led some to argue that economics is a &quot;genuine science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lazear |first=Edward P. |title=Economic Imperialism |date=1 February 2000 |volume=115 |issue=1 |jstor=2586936 |pages=99–146 |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |doi=10.1162/003355300554683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Profession===
{{Main|Economist}}
The professionalization of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject, has been described as &quot;the main change in economics since around 1900&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Orley Ashenfelter |first=Orley |last=Ashenfelter |date=2001 |title=Economics: Overview, The Profession of Economics |encyclopedia=[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]  |edition=first |editor-first1=N.J. |editor-last1=Smelser |editor-first2=P.B. |editor-last2=Baltes |publisher=Pergamon |volume=VI |p=4159  |isbn=978-0-0804-3076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most major [[universities]] and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which [[academic degrees]] are awarded in the subject, whether in the [[liberal arts]], business, or for professional study.

In the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including [[banking]] and [[finance]]. Economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national [[treasury]], [[central bank]] or [[bureau of statistics]].

There are dozens of prizes awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions to the field, the most prominent of which is the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], though it is not a [[Nobel Prize]].

Opening of David Graeber's review (p.&amp;nbsp;52): &quot;There is a growing feeling, among those who have the responsibility of managing large economies, that the discipline of economics is no longer fit for purpose. It is beginning to look like a science designed to solve problems that no longer exist.&quot;
