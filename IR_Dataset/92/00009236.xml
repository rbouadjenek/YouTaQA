The [[scientific theory]] of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin's book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution by natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable [[fact]]s about living organisms: (1) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, [[physiology]] and behaviour ([[Phenotype#Phenotypic variation|phenotypic variation]]), (2) different traits confer different rates of survival and [[reproduction]] (differential [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]) and (3) traits can be passed from generation to generation ([[heritability]] of fitness).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewontin70&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=November 1970 |title=The Units of Selection |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.01.110170.000245 |jstor=2096764 |issn=1545-2069 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206172942/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in successive generations members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the [[offspring|progenies]] of parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in their respective [[biophysical environment|environments]].

=== Classical times ===
The proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Anaximander#Origin of humankind|Anaximander]] and [[Empedocles#Cosmogony|Empedocles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|1983|pp=100–142, 280–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals survived into Roman times. The [[poet]] and philosopher [[Lucretius]] followed Empedocles in his masterwork ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (''On the Nature of Things'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucretius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedley |first=David |authorlink=David Sedley |year=2003 |title=Lucretius and the New Empedocles |url=http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |journal=Leeds International Classical Studies |volume=2 |issue=4 |issn=1477-3643 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823062637/http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
In contrast to these [[Materialism|materialistic]] views, [[Aristotelianism]] considered all natural things as [[potentiality and actuality|actualisations]] of fixed natural possibilities, known as [[Theory of forms|forms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Torrey37&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torrey |first1=Harry Beal |last2=Felin |first2=Frances |date=March 1937 |title=Was Aristotle an Evolutionist? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1086/394520 |issn=0033-5770 |jstor=2808399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull67&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hull |first=David L. |authorlink=David Hull |date=December 1967 |title=The Metaphysics of Evolution |journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]] |location=[[Cambridge]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of [[British Society for the History of Science|The British Society for the History of Science]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=309–337 |doi=10.1017/S0007087400002892 |jstor=4024958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a medieval [[teleology|teleological]] understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] in which all things have an intended role to play in a [[divinity|divine]] [[cosmos|cosmic]] order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the [[Middle Ages]] and were integrated into [[Christianity|Christian]] learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason|1962|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
In the 17th century, the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]] rejected the Aristotelian approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[physical law]]s that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, &quot;species&quot;, to plant and animal types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=256–257}}
* {{harvnb|Ray|1686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological classification introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |title=Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |date=July 7, 2000 |website=Evolution |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430160025/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |archivedate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Natural history|naturalists]] of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. In 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and [[Erasmus Darwin]] proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism (or &quot;filament&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html |title=Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) |date=October 4, 1995 |website=Evolution |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119004316/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html |archivedate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s &quot;transmutation&quot; theory of 1809,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; which envisaged [[spontaneous generation]] continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level, these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nardon_Grenier91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nardon|Grenier|1991|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould02&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The latter process was later called [[Lamarckism]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;Nardon_Grenier91&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ImaginaryLamarck&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |date=September–October 1994 |title=The Imaginary Lamarck: A Look at Bogus 'History' in Schoolbooks |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |journal=The Textbook Letter |oclc=23228649 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212174536/http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |archivedate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magner|2002}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonka07&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |authorlink1=Eva Jablonka |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion J. |authorlink2=Marion J.

In particular, [[Georges Cuvier]] insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by [[William Paley]] into the ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (1802), which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles Darwin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darwin91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Burkhardt|Smith|1991}}

=== Darwinian revolution ===
The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by [[Charles Darwin]] in terms of variable populations. Darwin used the expression &quot;'''descent with modification'''&quot; rather than &quot;evolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/search-results?pagesize=50&amp;sort=date-ascending&amp;pageno=0&amp;freetext=descent+with+modification&amp;allfields=&amp;searchid=&amp;name=Darwin+Charles+Robert&amp;dateafter=&amp;datebefore=&amp;searchtitle=&amp;description=&amp;place=&amp;publisher=&amp;periodical= |title=Search results for &quot;descent with modification&quot; - The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798) by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a &quot;struggle for existence&quot; in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sober09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |date=June 16, 2009 |title=Did Darwin write the ''Origin'' backwards? |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using [[paleontology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] to provide strong evidence that humans and [[ape]]s shared a common ancestry.

=== Pangenesis and heredity ===
The mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery.

[[File:ADN static.png|thumb|upright|[[DNA]] structure. [[nucleobase|Bases]] are in the centre, surrounded by phosphate–sugar chains in a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]].]]
Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[Eye color|eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the &quot;brown-eye trait&quot; from one of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Richard A. |last2=Frudakis |first2=Tony N. |date=August 2004 |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=15262401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] (genetic material) is called its genotype.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Helen |date=May 25, 2006 |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P |doi=10.1038/441398a |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16724031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Hill |first2=William G. |authorlink2=William G.

For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oetting |first1=William S. |last2=Brilliant |first2=Murray H. |last3=King |first3=Richard A. |date=August 1996 |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Molecular Medicine Today]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–335 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |issn=1357-4310 |pmid=8796918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson_2006&quot; /&gt; DNA is a long [[biopolymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Futuyma_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci]] (multiple interacting genes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Patrick C. |date=November 2008 |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=855–867 |doi=10.1038/nrg2452 |issn=1471-0056 |pmc=2689140 |pmid=18852697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rongling Wu |author2=Min Lin |date=March 2006 |title=Functional mapping — how to map and study the genetic architecture of dynamic complex traits |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=229–237 |doi=10.1038/nrg1804 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=16485021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of [[nucleotide]]s in the DNA.

{{main|Genetic variation}}
{{Further|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin&quot; /&gt; The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amos&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amos |first1=William |last2=Harwood |first2=John |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177–186 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692205 |pmid=9533122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewens W.J. 2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butlin |first1=Roger K. |last2=Tregenza |first2=Tom |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=187–198 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0201 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692210 |pmid=9533123}}

=== Mutation ===
{{Main|Mutation}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|upright|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]]]]
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |author3=Zhang Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |date=April 17, 2007 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Proc.

In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction.

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Mutation]] followed by natural selection results in a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewens W.J. 2004&quot; /&gt; for example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow and mutation bias.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
{{Further|Sexual selection}}
Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a &quot;self-evident&quot; mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewontin70&quot; /&gt;
* Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation).
* Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness).
* These traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).

More offspring are produced than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hurst |first=Laurence D. |authorlink=Laurence Hurst |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |date=February 2009 |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83–93 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=19119264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[teleonomy]] is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are [[teleology in biology|seemingly fitted]] for the [[function (biology)|functional]] roles they perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 Chapter XIV]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences of selection include [[Assortative mating|nonrandom mating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Otto |first1=Sarah P. |author-link1=Sarah Otto |last2=Servedio |first2=Maria R. |authorlink2=Maria Servedio|last3=Nuismer |first3=Scott L. |title=Frequency-Dependent Selection and the Evolution of Assortative Mating |journal=Genetics |date=August 2008 |volume=179 |issue=4 |pages=2091–2112 |issn=0016-6731 |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084418 |pmc=2516082 |pmid=18660541}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetic hitchhiking]].

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be &quot;selected ''for''.&quot; Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]].

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoekstra |first1=Hopi E. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Jonathan M. |last3=Berrigan |first3=David |last4=Vignieri |first4=Sacha N. |last5=Hoang |first5=Amy |last6=Hill |first6=Caryl E. |last7=Beerli |first7=Peter |last8=Kingsolver |first8=Joel G. |date=July 31, 2001 |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilising selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felsenstein |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Felsenstein |date=November 1979 |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773–795 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214112 |pmid=17248980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to eventually have a similar height.

A special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersson |first1=Malte |last2=Simmons |first2=Leigh W. |date=June 2006 |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=296–302 |pmid=16769428 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015 |issn=0169-5347 |url=http://academic.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/2_anderson-simmons_2006.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309112854/http://academic.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/2_Anderson-Simmons_2006.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-09|citeseerx=10.1.1.595.4050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. &quot;Nature&quot; in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[Abiotic component|physical]] as well as [[Biotic component|biological]], in their local environment. [[Eugene Odum]], a founder of [[ecology]], defined an ecosystem as: &quot;Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e., exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system....&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odum1971&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Odum|1971|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

==== Genetic hitchhiking ====
{{Further|Genetic hitchhiking|Hill–Robertson effect|Selective sweep}}
Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lien |first1=Sigbjørn |last2=Szyda |first2=Joanna |last3=Schechinger |first3=Birgit |last4=Rappold |first4=Gudrun |last5=Arnheim |first5=Norm |date=February 2000 |title=Evidence for Heterogeneity in Recombination in the Human Pseudoautosomal Region: High Resolution Analysis by Sperm Typing and Radiation-Hybrid Mapping |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=557–566 |doi=10.1086/302754 |issn=0002-9297 |pmc=1288109 |pmid=10677316 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to [[independence (probability theory)|expectations]], which is called their [[linkage disequilibrium]]. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=Nicholas H. |authorlink=Nick Barton |date=November 29, 2000 |title=Genetic hitchhiking |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1553–1562 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692896 |pmid=11127900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.&lt;ref name=&quot;gillespie 2001&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Allele-frequency.png|thumb|Simulation of genetic drift of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 (top) and 100 (bottom). Drift to [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] is more rapid in the smaller population.]]

Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lande |first=Russell |year=1989 |title=Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal=[[Genome (journal)|Genome]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=221–227 |doi=10.1139/g89-037 |issn=0831-2796 |pmid=2687093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene flow ===
{{Further|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56&quot; /&gt; The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the [[Species problem#Mayr's Biological Species Concept|''Biological Species Concept'']] (BSC).

Contemporary thinking about the role of mutation biases reflects a different theory from that of Haldane and Fisher.

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding [[Predation|predators]] or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as [[macroevolution]] versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in [[allele frequency]] and adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottEC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new [[habitat]]s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould_1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=July 19, 1994 |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=483}}: &quot;Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sixth edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' (2010) defines ''adaptation'' as &quot;Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of [[horse]]s' teeth to the grinding of grass.

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakajima |first1=Akira |last2=Sugimoto |first2=Yohko |last3=Yoneyama |first3=Hiroshi |last4=Nakae |first4=Taiji |date=June 2002 |title=High-Level Fluoroquinolone Resistance in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' Due to Interplay of the MexAB-OprM Efflux Pump and the DNA Gyrase Mutation |journal=Microbiology and Immunology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=391–395 |doi=10.1111/j.1348-0421.2002.tb02711.x |issn=1348-0421 |pmid=12153116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other striking examples are the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' evolving the ability to use [[citric acid]] as a nutrient in a [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term laboratory experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blount |first1=Zachary D. |last2=Borland |first2=Christina Z. |last3=Lenski |first3=Richard E. |date=June 10, 2008 |title=Inaugural Article: Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of ''Escherichia coli'' |journal=Proc.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within [[bat]] wings, for example, are very similar to those in [[mouse|mice]] feet and [[primate]] hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Nathan M. |last2=HallgrÍmsson |first2=Benedikt |date=December 2005 |title=Serial homology and the evolution of mammalian limb covariation structure |journal=Evolution |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=2691–2704 |doi=10.1554/05-233.1 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=16526515}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since all living organisms are related to some extent,&lt;ref name=&quot;Penny1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=David |last2=Poole |first2=Anthony |date=December 1999 |title=The nature of the last universal common ancestor |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=672–677 |doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(99)00020-9 |issn=0959-437X |pmid=10607605}}&lt;/ref&gt; even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as [[arthropod]], [[squid]] and [[vertebrate]] eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called [[deep homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Brian K. |date=August 2003 |title=Descent with modification: the unity underlying homology and homoplasy as seen through an analysis of development and evolution |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=409–433 |doi=10.1017/S1464793102006097 |issn=1464-7931 |pmid=14558591|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4121a44f4ff2eb305331d61015e159dec5b6b856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shubin |first1=Neil |authorlink1=Neil Shubin |last2=Tabin |first2=Clifford J. |authorlink2=Clifford Tabin |last3=Carroll |first3=Sean B. |date=February 12, 2009 |title=Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=818–823 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..818S |doi=10.1038/nature07891 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=19212399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Coevolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in social insects, such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertram&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertram |first=John S. |date=December 2000 |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=[[Molecular Aspects of Medicine]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |issn=0098-2997 |pmid=11173079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gavrilets&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gavrilets |first=Sergey |date=October 2003 |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2215 |doi=10.1554/02-727 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=14628909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways to define the concept of &quot;species.&quot; The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Queiroz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Kevin |date=May 3, 2005 |title=Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal=Proc.

Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ereshefsky92&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Ereshefsky |date=December 1992 |title=Eliminative pluralism |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=671–690 |doi=10.1086/289701 |issn=0031-8248 |jstor=188136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Biological Species Concept'' (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach.

[[Reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their [[most recent common ancestor]], it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and [[donkey]]s mating to produce [[mule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Short |first=Roger Valentine |date=October 1975 |title=The contribution of the mule to scientific thought |journal=Journal of Reproduction and Fertility.

In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct.

There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herrel |first1=Anthony |last2=Huyghe |first2=Katleen |last3=Vanhooydonck |first3=Bieke |last4=Backeljau |first4=Thierry |last5=Breugelmans |first5=Karin |last6=Grbac |first6=Irena |last7=Van Damme |first7=Raoul |last8=Irschick |first8=Duncan J. |date=March 25, 2008 |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proc.

The second mode of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation after an increase in [[inbreeding]] increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Templeton |first=Alan R. |authorlink=Alan Templeton |date=April 1980 |title=The Theory of Speciation ''VIA'' the Founder Principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1038 |pmid=6777243 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214177 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063455/http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |archivedate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mode is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gavrilets&quot; /&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovics |first=Janis |authorlink=Janis Antonovics |date=July 2006 |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |issn=0018-067X |pmid=16639420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]], which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nosil |first1=Patrik |last2=Crespi |first2=Bernard J. |last3=Gries |first3=Regine |last4=Gries |first4=Gerhard |date=March 2007 |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–327 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |pmid=16900317 |issn=0016-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in [[sympatric speciation]] species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savolainen |first1=Vincent |last2=Anstett |first2=Marie-Charlotte |last3=Lexer |first3=Christian |last4=Hutton |first4=Ian |last5=Clarkson |first5=James J. |last6=Norup |first6=Maria V. |last7=Powell |first7=Martyn P. |last8=Springate |first8=David |last9=Salamin |first9=Nicolas |last10=Baker |first10=William J. |date=May 11, 2006 |title=Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7090 |pages=210–213 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..210S |doi=10.1038/nature04566 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16467788 |display-authors=3}}

One type of sympatric speciation involves [[crossbreed]]ing of two related species to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair.

This view dates back to an idea briefly mentioned by Darwin but later abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bnotebook&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=27 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history. Fossils, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jablonski |first=David |date=June 25, 1999 |title=The Future of the Fossil Record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–2116 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |issn=0036-8075|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe761f71c762f11618771d8c2593f9819b1472c0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Stephen F. |date=September 6, 1984 |title=Origins of biomolecular handedness |journal=Nature |volume=311 |issue=5981 |pages=19–23 |bibcode=1984Natur.311...19M |doi=10.1038/311019a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=6472461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[molecular genetics]] has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the [[molecular clock]] produced by mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=Yuri I. |last2=Rogozin |first2=Igor B. |last3=Grishin |first3=Nick V. |last4=Koonin |first4=Eugene V. |authorlink4=Eugene Koonin |date=September 1, 2002 |title=Genome trees and the tree of life |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=472–479 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02744-0 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=12175808}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varki |first1=Ajit |authorlink1=Ajit Varki |last2=Altheide |first2=Tasha K. |date=December 2005 |title=Comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes: searching for needles in a haystack |journal=Genome Research |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1746–1758 |doi=10.1101/gr.3737405 |issn=1088-9051 |pmid=16339373|citeseerx=10.1.1.673.9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kutschera&quot; /&gt; However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some [[Theism|theists]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the philosophical, religious and cosmological controversies, see:

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of [[creationism]] was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] form as [[intelligent design]] (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.
