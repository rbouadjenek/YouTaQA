The '''Comoros''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Comoros.ogg|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ər|oʊ|z}}; {{lang-ar|جزر القمر}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Juzur al-Qumur{{\}}Qamar}}''), officially the '''Union of the Comoros''' ([[Comorian language|Comorian]]: ''Udzima wa Komori,'' {{lang-fr|Union des Comores}}, {{lang-ar|الاتحاد القمري}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Ittiḥād al-Qumurī{{\}}Qamarī}}''), is an [[island country]]  in the [[Indian Ocean]] located at the northern end of the [[Mozambique Channel]] off the eastern coast of [[Africa]] between northeastern [[Mozambique]], the [[France|French]] [[regions of France|region]] of [[Mayotte]], and northwestern [[Madagascar]]. The capital and largest city in Comoros is [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]]. The religion of the majority of the population is Sunni Islam. As a member of the [[Arab League]], the Comoros is the only country in the [[Arab world]] which is entirely in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

At {{convert|1660|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, excluding the contested island of [[Mayotte]], the Comoros is the fourth-smallest African nation by area. The population, excluding Mayotte, is estimated at {{UN Population|Comoros}}.{{UN Population|ref}} As a nation formed at a crossroads of different civilisations, the archipelago is noted for its diverse culture and history.  The archipelago was first inhabited by [[Bantu language|Bantu]] speakers who came from East Africa, supplemented by Arab and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] immigration.

The [[sovereign state]] is an [[archipelago]] consisting of three major islands and numerous smaller islands, all in the [[Volcanic island|volcanic]] [[Comoro Islands]].  The major islands are commonly known by their French names: northwestern-most [[Grande Comore]] (Ngazidja), [[Mohéli]] (Mwali), and [[Anjouan]] (Nzwani).  In addition, the country has a claim on a fourth major island, southeastern-most Mayotte (Maore), though [[Mayotte]] voted against independence from France in 1974, has never been administered by an independent Comoros government, and continues to be administered by [[France]] (currently as an [[overseas department]]). France has [[veto]]ed [[United Nations Security Council]] [[List of Vetoed United Nation Security Council Resolutions|resolutions]] that would affirm Comorian [[sovereignty]] over the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA31_first-resolution&quot;&gt;The first UN General Assembly Resolution regarding the matter, &quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408191407/http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Comoros/1156213396.pdf Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte] (PDF)&quot;, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/31/4, (21 October 1976) states &quot;the occupation by France of the Comorian island of Mayotte constitutes a flagrant encroachment on the national unity of the Comorian State, a Member of the United Nations,&quot; rejecting the French-administered referendums and condemning French presence in Mayotte.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As defined by the [[Organization of African Unity]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and the [[United Nations General Assembly]]: the most recent UN General Assembly Resolution regarding the matter, &quot;Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte,&quot; United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/49/18, (6 December 1994) states &quot;the results of the referendum of 22 December 1974 were to be considered on a global basis and not island by island,...Reaffirms the sovereignty of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros over the island of Mayotte&quot;.

It became part of the [[French colonial empire]] in the end of 19th century before becoming independent in 1975. Since declaring [[independence]], the country has experienced more than 20 [[coups d'état]] or attempted coups, with various heads of state assassinated.&lt;ref name=20Coups /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intrigue in the world's most coup-prone island paradise |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/12/22/intrigue-in-the-worlds-most-coup-prone-island-paradise |website=economist.com |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=25 January 2019 |ref=print issue: 22 Dec. 2018, p. 75 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125081810/https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/12/22/intrigue-in-the-worlds-most-coup-prone-island-paradise |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this constant political instability, the population of the Comoros lives with the worst [[List of countries by income equality|income inequality]] of any nation, with a [[Gini coefficient]] over 60%, while also ranking in the [[List of countries by Human Development Index#Low human development|worst quartile]] on the [[Human Development Index]]. {{As of|2008}} about half the population lived below the [[international poverty line]] of US$1.25 a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf ''Human Development Indices''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219191319/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf |date=19 December 2008 }}, Table 3: Human and income poverty, p. 35.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Comoros&quot; derives from the Arabic word {{lang|ar|&lt;big&gt;[[wikt:قمر#Noun|قمر]]&lt;/big&gt;}} ''qamar'' (&quot;[[moon]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.comores-online.com/mwezinet/histoire/islandsofthemoon.htm|title=The Islands of the Moon|journal=Aramco World|volume=47|issue=4|date=July–August 1996|pages=40|access-date=20 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013214138/http://comores-online.com/mwezinet/histoire/islandsofthemoon.htm|archive-date=13 October 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first human inhabitants of the Comoro Islands are thought to have been [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] settlers travelling by boat from [[Island Southeast Asia|islands in Southeast Asia]]. These people arrived no later than the sixth century AD, the date of the earliest known [[archaeological]] site, found on [[Nzwani]], although settlement beginning as early as the first century has been postulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Country Study: Comoros |publisher=US Department of the Army |author=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress under the Country Studies/Area Handbook Program |date=August 1994 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/kmtoc.html |accessdate=15 January 2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |editor=Ralph K.

The islands of the Comoros were populated by a succession of peoples from the coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Malay Archipelago]], and [[Madagascar]]. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking settlers reached the islands as a part of the greater [[Bantu expansion]] that took place in Africa throughout the first millennium.

According to pre-Islamic mythology, a [[jinn]]i (spirit) dropped a [[Gemstone|jewel]], which formed a great circular inferno. This became the [[Mount Karthala|Karthala volcano]], which created the island of Grande Comoro.

Development of the Comoros is divided into phases. The earliest reliably recorded phase is the Dembeni phase (ninth to tenth centuries), during which each island maintained a single, central village.&lt;ref name=spear&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas Spear |title=Early Swahili History Reconsidered |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=33 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=257–290|doi=10.2307/220649 |jstor=220649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, trade with the island of Madagascar and merchants from the [[Middle East]] flourished, smaller villages emerged, and existing towns expanded. Many Comorians can trace their genealogies to ancestors from [[Yemen]], mainly [[Hadhramaut]], and [[Oman]].

=== Medieval Comoros ===
According to legend, in 632, upon hearing of [[Islam]], islanders are said to have dispatched an emissary, Mtswa-Mwindza, to [[Mecca]]—but by the time he arrived there, the Prophet [[Muhammad]] had died. Nonetheless, after a stay in Mecca, he returned to Ngazidja and led the gradual conversion of his islanders to Islam.&lt;ref name=verin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierre Vérin|title=Mtswa Muyindza et l'introduction de l'Islam à Ngazidja; au sujet de la tradition et du texte de Pechmarty|journal=Etudes Océan Indien|volume=2|year=1982|pages=95–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest accounts of East Africa, the works of [[Al-Masudi]] describe early Islamic trade routes, and how the coast and islands were frequently visited by [[Muslim]]s including [[Persia]]n and [[Arab]] merchants and sailors in search of [[coral]], [[ambergris]], [[ivory]], [[tortoiseshell]], [[gold]] and slaves. They also brought Islam to the people of the [[Zanj]] including the Comoros. As the importance of the Comoros grew along the East African coast, both small and large [[mosque]]s were constructed. Despite its distance from the coast, the Comoros is situated along the [[Swahili Coast]] in [[East Africa]]. It was a major hub of trade and an important location in a network of trading towns that included [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], in present-day Tanzania, Sofala (an outlet for [[Zimbabwe]]an gold), in [[Mozambique]], and [[Mombasa]] in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=spear /&gt;

After the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the early 15th century and subsequent collapse of the East African sultanates, the powerful Omani Sultan [[Saif bin Sultan]] began to defeat the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the Portuguese. His successor [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Said bin Sultan]] increased Omani Arab influence in the region, moving his administration to nearby [[Zanzibar]], which came under [[Oman]]i rule. Nevertheless, the Comoros remained independent, and although the three smaller islands were usually politically unified, the largest island, Ngazidja, was divided into a number of autonomous kingdoms (''ntsi'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Spear 1984 291–305&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas Spear |title=The Shirazi in Swahili Traditions, Culture, and History |journal=History in Africa |volume=11 |year=1984 |pages=291–305|doi=10.2307/3171638 |publisher=African Studies Association |jstor=3171638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Europeans showed interest in the Comoros, the islanders were well placed to take advantage of their needs, initially supplying ships of the route to India and, later, slaves to the plantation islands in the [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarenes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Spear 1984 291–305&quot; /&gt;

Portuguese explorers first visited the [[archipelago]] in 1503. The islands provided provisions to the Portuguese fort at Mozambique throughout the 16th century.
[[File:Camora.jpg|thumb|left|An 1808 map refers to the islands as &quot;Camora&quot;.]]

In 1793, Malagasy warriors from Madagascar first started raiding the islands for [[slave]]s. On the Comoros, it was estimated in 1865 that as much as 40% of the population consisted of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/comoros/2.htm Comoros – Early Visitors and Settlers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613173553/http://countrystudies.us/comoros/2.htm |date=13 June 2011 }}&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; France first established [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule in the Comoros in 1841. The first French colonists landed in Mayotte, and ''[[Andriantsoly]]'' (also known as Andrian Tsouli, the Sakalava Dia-Ntsoli, the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]] of [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]], and the Malagasy King of Mayotte) signed the Treaty of April 1841,&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam 1979, vol. v, p. 381&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isamveri.org/pdfdkm/12/DKM120302.pdf |title=French acquisition of Comoros |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam 1979, vol. v, p. 381 |access-date=18 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208052216/http://isamveri.org/pdfdkm/12/DKM120302.pdf |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which ceded the island to the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottenheimer|Ottenheimer]], pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comoros served as a way station for merchants sailing to the Far East and India until the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] significantly reduced traffic passing through the [[Mozambique Channel]]. The native commodities exported by the Comoros were [[coconut]]s, cattle and tortoiseshell. French settlers, French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as well, and the major crops of [[ylang-ylang]], [[vanilla]], [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean]]s, and [[sisal]] were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=African Studies Bulletin |title=The Comoro Islands: A Bibliographical Essay |author=Barbara Dubins |date=September 1969 |pages=131–137 |volume=12 |issue=2|doi=10.2307/523155 |publisher=African Studies Association |jstor=523155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Mohéli was placed under French protection by its Sultan Mardjani Abdou Cheikh. That same year, despite having no authority to do so, Sultan Said Ali of [[Sultanate of Bambao|Bambao]], one of the sultanates on Ngazidja, placed the island under French protection in exchange for French support of his claim to the entire island, which he retained until his abdication in 1910. In 1908 the islands were unified under a single administration (''Colonie de Mayotte et dépendances'') and placed under the authority of the French colonial governor general of Madagascar. In 1909, Sultan Said Muhamed of Anjouan abdicated in favour of French rule. In 1912 the colony and the protectorates were abolished and the islands became a province of the colony of Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |title=The Comoro Islands: Problems of a Microcosm |author=André Bourde |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=May 1965 |pages=91–102 |url= |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00004924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for the Comoros to become independent in 1978. The deputies of [[Mayotte]] abstained. Referendums were held on all four of the islands. Three voted for independence by large margins, while Mayotte voted against, and remains under French administration. On 6 July 1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a unilateral resolution declaring independence. Ahmed Abdallah proclaimed the independence of the Comorian State (''État comorien''; دولة القمر) and became its first president.

The next 30 years were a period of political turmoil. On 3 August 1975, less than one month after independence, president [[Ahmed Abdallah]] was removed from office in an armed coup and replaced with United National Front of the Comoros (FNUK) member Prince [[Said Mohamed Jaffar]]. Months later, in January 1976, Jaffar was ousted in favour of his Minister of Defense [[Ali Soilih]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mukonoweshuro:555-577&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Politics of Squalor and Dependency: Chronic Political Instability and Economic Collapse in the Comoro Islands |author=Eliphas G.

At this time, the population of [[Mayotte]] voted against independence from France in two referenda. The [[1974 Comorian independence referendum|first]], held on 22 December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with France, while the [[1976 Mahoran status referendum|second]], held in February 1976, confirmed that vote with an overwhelming 99.4%. The three remaining islands, ruled by President Soilih, instituted a number of [[socialism|socialist]] and isolationist policies that soon strained relations with France. On 13 May 1978, [[Bob Denard]] returned to overthrow President Soilih and reinstate Abdallah with the support of the French, Rhodesian and South African governments. During Soilih's brief rule, he faced seven additional coup attempts until he was finally forced from office and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mukonoweshuro:555-577&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In contrast to Soilih, Abdallah's presidency was marked by authoritarian rule and increased adherence to traditional Islam&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakar:181-191&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Small Island Systems: A Case Study of the Comoro Islands |journal=Comparative Education |author=Abdourahim Said Bakar |volume=24 |issue=2, Special Number (11): Education and Minority Groups |year=1988 |pages=181–191 |url= |doi=10.1080/0305006880240203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country was renamed the Federal [[Islamic Republic]] of the Comoros (''République Fédérale Islamique des Comores''; جمهورية القمر الإتحادية الإسلامية). Abdallah continued as president until 1989 when, fearing a probable [[coup d'état]], he signed a decree ordering the Presidential Guard, led by Bob Denard, to disarm the armed forces. Shortly after the signing of the decree, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an antitank missile was launched into his bedroom and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mercenary Holding Island Nation Seeks Deal |author=Christopher S.

A few days later, Bob Denard was evacuated to South Africa by French paratroopers. [[Said Mohamed Djohar]], Soilih's older half-brother, then became president, and served until September 1995, when Bob Denard returned and attempted another coup.

The islands of [[Anjouan]] and [[Mohéli]] declared their independence from the Comoros in 1997, in an attempt to restore French rule. But France rejected their request, leading to bloody confrontations between federal troops and rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COMORO ISLANDS: Tension Rising in the Indian Ocean Archipelago|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/1997/09/comoro-islands-tension-rising-in-the-indian-ocean-archipelago/|author=Moyiga Nduru|publisher=IPS-Inter Press Service/Global Information Network|date=17 September 1997|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024014506/http://www.ipsnews.net/1997/09/comoro-islands-tension-rising-in-the-indian-ocean-archipelago/|archive-date=24 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1999, Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]], Army Chief of Staff, seized power in a bloodless coup, overthrowing the Interim President Massounde, citing weak leadership in the face of the crisis.

Azali failed to consolidate power and reestablish control over the islands, which was the subject of international criticism. The [[African Union]], under the auspices of President [[Thabo Mbeki]] of South Africa, imposed sanctions on Anjouan to help broker negotiations and effect reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breakaway island's ruler says no civilian rule until secession crisis resolved |agency=Associated Press |author=Rodrique Ngowi |date=3 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mbeki flies in to Comoros islands summit in bid to resolve political crisis |publisher=Agence France Presse |date=20 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the country was changed to the Union of the Comoros and a new system of political autonomy was instituted for each island, plus a union government for the three islands was added.

Azali stepped down in 2002 to run in the democratic election of the President of the Comoros, which he won. Under ongoing international pressure, as a military ruler who had originally come to power by force, and was not always democratic while in office, Azali led the Comoros through constitutional changes that enabled new elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comoros said &quot;calm&quot; after Azali Assoumani declared elected as federal president |date=10 May 2002 |publisher=BBC Monitoring Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''Loi des compétences'' law was passed in early 2005 that defines the responsibilities of each governmental body, and is in the process of implementation. The elections in 2006 were won by [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]], a Sunni Muslim cleric nicknamed the &quot;Ayatollah&quot; for his time spent studying Islam in Iran. Azali honoured the election results, thus allowing the first peaceful and democratic exchange of power for the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comoros; Ahmed Abdallah Sambi Set to Win Presidency by a Landslide |date=15 May 2006 |publisher=AllAfrica, Inc.

Colonel [[Mohammed Bacar]], a French-trained former gendarme, seized power as President in Anjouan in 2001. He staged a vote in June 2007 to confirm his leadership that was rejected as illegal by the Comoros federal government and the African Union. On 25 March 2008 hundreds of soldiers from the African Union and the Comoros seized rebel-held Anjouan, generally welcomed by the population: there have been reports of hundreds, if not thousands, of people tortured during Bacar's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= COMOROS: The legacy of a Big Man on a small island | publisher= [[IRIN]] | url= http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=81898 | access-date= 25 March 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055102/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=81898 | archive-date= 20 December 2008 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some rebels were killed and injured, but there are no official figures. At least 11 civilians were wounded. Some officials were imprisoned. Bacar fled in a speedboat to the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte to seek asylum. Anti-French protests followed in the Comoros (see [[2008 invasion of Anjouan]]).

Since independence from France, the Comoros experienced more than 20 coups or attempted coups.&lt;ref name=20Coups&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7316177.stm |title=Anti-French protests in Comoros |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2008 |accessdate=27 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328234541/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7316177.stm |archive-date=28 March 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following elections in late 2010, former Vice-President [[Ikililou Dhoinine]] was inaugurated as President on 26 May 2011. A member of the ruling party, Dhoinine was supported in the election by the incumbent President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi. Dhoinine, a pharmacist by training, is the first President of the Comoros from the island of Mohéli. Following the 2016 elections, Azali Assoumani became president for a third term.

== Geography ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
{{Main|Geography of the Comoros}}
[[File:Cn-map.png|thumb|upright=1.35|A map of the Comoros]]

The Comoros is formed by [[Grande Comore|Ngazidja]] (Grande Comore), [[Mohéli|Mwali]] (Mohéli) and [[Anjouan|Nzwani]] (Anjouan), three major islands in the Comoros Archipelago, as well as many minor islets. The islands are officially known by their Comorian language names, though international sources still use their French names (given in parentheses above). The capital and largest city, [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], is located on Ngazidja. The archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, in the [[Mozambique Channel]], between the African coast (nearest to [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Madagascar]], with no land borders.

At {{convert|2034|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it is one of the smallest countries in the world. The Comoros also has claim to {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of territorial seas. The interiors of the islands vary from steep mountains to low hills.

Ngazidja is the largest of the Comoros Archipelago, approximately equal in area to the other islands combined. It is also the most recent island, and therefore has rocky soil. The island's two volcanoes, [[Mount Karthala|Karthala]] (active) and [[La Grille]] (dormant), and the lack of good harbours are distinctive characteristics of its terrain. Mwali, with its capital at [[Fomboni]], is the smallest of the four major islands. Nzwani, whose capital is [[Mutsamudu]], has a distinctive triangular shape caused by three mountain chains – [[Sima, Comoros|Sima]], [[Nioumakélé]] and [[Jimilimé]] – emanating from a central peak, Mount [[N'Tingui]] ({{convert|1575|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

The islands of the Comoros Archipelago were formed by volcanic activity. Mount Karthala, an active [[shield volcano]] located on Ngazidja, is the country's highest point, at {{convert|2,361|m|abbr=off}}. It contains the Comoros' largest patch of disappearing rainforest. Karthala is currently one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with a minor eruption in May 2006, and prior eruptions as recently as April 2005 and 1991. In the 2005 eruption, which lasted from 17 to 19 April, 40,000 citizens were evacuated, and the [[volcanic crater lake|crater lake]] in the volcano's {{convert|3|by|4|km|mi|abbr=off}} [[caldera]] was destroyed.

The Comoros also lays claim to the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|''Îles Éparses'' or ''Îles éparses de l'océan indien'']] (Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean) – [[Glorioso Islands]], comprising [[Grande Glorieuse]], [[Île du Lys]], [[Wreck Rock]], [[South Rock]], [[Verte Rocks]] (three islets) and three unnamed islets – one of France's overseas districts. The Glorioso Islands were administered by the colonial Comoros before 1975, and are therefore sometimes considered part of the Comoros Archipelago. [[Banc du Geyser]], a former island in the Comoros Archipelago, now submerged, is geographically located in the ''Îles Éparses'', but was annexed by [[Madagascar]] in 1976 as an unclaimed territory. The Comoros and France each still view the Banc du Geyser as part of the Glorioso Islands and, thus, part of its particular exclusive economic zone.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Moroni, Comoros#Geography and climate}}

The climate is generally tropical and mild, and the two major seasons are distinguishable by their raininess. The temperature reaches an average of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}} in March, the hottest month in the rainy season (called kashkazi/kaskazi [meaning north monsoon], which runs from December to April), and an average low of {{convert|19|°C|°F}} in the cool, dry season (kusi (meaning south monsoon), which proceeds from May to November).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ottenheimer|Ottenheimer]], pp. 20, 72&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are rarely subject to [[cyclone]]s.

== Government ==
{{Main|Politics of the Comoros}}
[[File:Moroni harbour (2).jpg|thumb|[[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], capital of the Comoros, with Harbor Bay and Central Mosque]]

Politics of the Comoros takes place in a framework of a [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of the Comoros]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. The Constitution of the Union of the Comoros was ratified by referendum on 23 December 2001, and the islands' constitutions and executives were elected in the following months. It had previously been considered a military dictatorship, and the transfer of power from Azali Assoumani to Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi in May 2006 was a watershed moment as it was the first peaceful transfer in Comorian history.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and parliament. The preamble of the constitution guarantees an Islamic inspiration in governance, a commitment to human rights, and several specific enumerated rights, democracy, &quot;a common destiny&quot; for all Comorians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comoros 2001 (rev. 2009)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Comoros_2009?lang=en#1|website=Constitute|accessdate=23 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906053225/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Comoros_2009?lang=en#1|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the islands (according to Title II of the Constitution) has a great amount of autonomy in the Union, including having their own constitutions (or Fundamental Law), president, and Parliament. The presidency and Assembly of the Union are distinct from each of the islands' governments. The presidency of the Union rotates between the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;CfHR_Law-of-the-Union&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/constitutions/docs/ComorosC%20(english%20summary)(rev).doc |format=Word document |title=FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE UNION OF COMOROS (English excerpts) |publisher=Centre for Human Rights, University of Pretoria, South Africa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009114022/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/constitutions/docs/ComorosC%20(english%20summary)(rev).doc |archivedate=9 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohéli holds the current presidency rotation, and so Ikililou Dhoinine is President of the Union; Grand Comore and Anjouan follow in four-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/km.html AFRICAN ELECTIONS DATABASE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709032541/http://africanelections.tripod.com/km.html |date=9 July 2011 }}, Elections in the Comoros.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal system ===
The Comorian [[legal system]] rests on [[Islamic#Law|Islamic law]], an inherited French ([[Napoleonic Code]]) legal code, and customary law (mila na ntsi). Village elders, kadis or civilian courts settle most disputes. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the [[legislative]] and the executive. The Supreme Court acts as a Constitutional Council in resolving constitutional questions and supervising presidential elections. As High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court also arbitrates in cases where the government is accused of malpractice. The Supreme Court consists of two members selected by the president, two elected by the Federal Assembly, and one by the council of each island.&lt;ref name=&quot;CfHR_Law-of-the-Union&quot; /&gt;

=== Political culture ===
Around 80 percent of the central government's annual budget is spent on the country's complex electoral system which provides for a semi-autonomous government and president for each of the three islands and a rotating presidency for the overarching Union government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= COMOROS: Reforming 'the coup-coup islands' | publisher= [[IRIN]] | url= http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83144 | access-date= 25 March 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090930032932/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83144 | archive-date= 30 September 2009 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A referendum took place on 16 May 2009 to decide whether to cut down the government's unwieldy political bureaucracy. 52.7% of those eligible voted, and 93.8% of votes were cast in approval of the referendum.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of the Comoros}}
In November 1975, the Comoros became the 143rd member of the [[United Nations]]. The new nation was defined as comprising the entire [[archipelago]], although the citizens of [[Mayotte]] chose to become French citizens and keep their island as a French territory.&lt;ref&gt;Security Council S/PV. 1888 para 247 S/11967 [http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317010910/http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm |date=17 March 2008 }} [http://legal.un.org/repertory/art33/english/rep_supp5_vol2-art33_e.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

The Comoros has repeatedly pressed its claim to Mayotte before the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which adopted a series of resolutions under the caption &quot;Question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte&quot;, opining that Mayotte belongs to the Comoros under the principle that the territorial integrity of colonial territories should be preserved upon independence. As a practical matter, however, these resolutions have little effect and there is no foreseeable likelihood that Mayotte will become ''de facto'' part of the Comoros without its people's consent. More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action. Other bodies, including the [[Organization of African Unity]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], have similarly questioned French sovereignty over Mayotte.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA31_first-resolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Comoros/1156245840.pdf|title=Forty-ninth session: Agenda item 36: 49/18.

The new status was effective on 31 March 2011 and Mayotte has been recognised as an [[outermost region]] by the [[European Union]] on 1 January 2014. This decision integrates Mayotte in the [[French Republic]] legally « one and indivisible ».

The Comoros is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[European Development Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] and the [[African Development Bank]]. On 10 April 2008, the Comoros became the 179th nation to accept the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf|title=unfccc.int KYOTO PROTOCOL – STATUS OF RATIFICATION|website=Unfccc.int|accessdate=25 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918081611/http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf|archive-date=18 September 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Comoros signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&amp;chapter=26&amp;clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&amp;nbsp;– No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 the Union of the Comoros became known for filing a referral to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding the events of &quot;the 31 May 2010 Israeli raid on the Humanitarian Aid Flotilla bound for [the] Gaza Strip&quot;.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military of the Comoros}}
The military resources of the Comoros consist of a small standing army and a 500-member police force, as well as a 500-member defence force. A defence treaty with France provides naval resources for protection of territorial waters, training of Comorian military personnel, and air surveillance. France maintains a few senior officers presence in the Comoros at government request. France maintains a small maritime base and a [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] Detachment (DLEM) on [[Mayotte]].

Once the new government was installed in May–June 2011, an expert mission from UNREC (Lomé) came to the Comoros and produced guidelines for the elaboration of a national security policy, which were discussed by different actors, notably the national defence authorities and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;FINAL EVALUATION, Peace Building Fund Programme in the Comoros 2008–2011, 19 October 2011 – 8 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the programme in end March 2012, a normative framework agreed upon by all entities involved in SSR will have been established. This will then have to be adopted by Parliament and implemented by the authorities.

{{Main|Economy of the Comoros}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Comoros.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of the Comoros's exports]]

The level of [[poverty]] in the Comoros is high, but &quot;judging by the [[Poverty threshold|international poverty threshold]] of $1.9 per person per day, only two out of every ten Comorians could be classified as poor, a rate that places the Comoros ahead of other [[low-income countries]] and 30 percentage points ahead of other countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&quot;&lt;ref name=2018WorldBank&gt;[https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/comoros/publication/latest-report-on-poverty-in-the-comoros Latest Report on Poverty in the Comoros], World Bank (June 14, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty declined by about 10% between 2014 and 2018, and living conditions generally improved.&lt;ref name=2018WorldBank/&gt; [[Economic inequality]] remains widespread, with a major gap between rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name=2018WorldBank/&gt; [[Remittance]]s through the sizable Comorian diaspora form a substantial part of the country's GDP&lt;ref name=CSIS&gt;[https://www.csis.org/analysis/comoros-big-troubles-some-small-islands Comoros: Big Troubles on Some Small Islands], Center for Strategic and International Studies (April 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and have contributed to decreases in poverty and increases in living standards.&lt;ref name=2018WorldBank/&gt; 

According to [[ILO]]'s ILOSTAT statistical database, between 1991 and 2019 the [[unemployment rate]] as a percent of the total labor force ranged from.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)], International Labour Organization, ILOSTAT database. Data retrieved in December 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2005 paper by the Comoros Ministry of Planning and Regional Development, however, reported that &quot;registered unemployment rate is 14.3 percent, distributed very unevenly among and within the islands, but with marked incidence in urban areas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Office of the General Commissioner for Planning, Ministry of Planning and Regional Development&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=UNION OF THE COMOROS: POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY PAPER (UPDATED INTERIM PAPER) |author=Office of the General Commissioner for Planning, Ministry of Planning and Regional Development |date=October 2005 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/Comoros_IPRSP(Oct2005).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231121817/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/Comoros_IPRSP(Oct2005).pdf |archive-date=31 December 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, more than 56% of the labor force was employed in agriculture, with 29% employed in industry and 14% employed in services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/comoros/economy Comoros: Economy], globalEDGE, Michigan State University (January 29, 2020).&lt;/ref&gt; The islands' agricultural sector is based on the export of [[spice]]s, including [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], and [[cloves]], and thus susceptible to price fluctuations in the volatile world [[commodity market]] for these goods.&lt;ref name=CSIS/&gt; The Comoros is the world's largest producer of [[ylang-ylang]], a plant whose extracted [[essential oil]] is used in the [[perfume]] industry; some 80% of the world's supply comes from the Comoros.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Graingerm [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3652780.stm Comoros seeks sweet smell of success], BBC News (September 14, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

High population densities, as much as 1000 per square kilometre in the densest agricultural zones, for what is still a mostly rural, agricultural economy may lead to an environmental crisis in the near future, especially considering the high rate of population growth.  In 2004 the Comoros' real GDP growth was a low 1.9% and real GDP per capita continued to decline. These declines are explained by factors including declining investment, drops in consumption, rising inflation, and an increase in trade imbalance due in part to lowered cash crop prices, especially vanilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office of the General Commissioner for Planning, Ministry of Planning and Regional Development&quot; /&gt;

Fiscal policy is constrained by erratic fiscal revenues, a bloated civil service wage bill, and an external debt that is far above the [[Heavily indebted poor countries|HIPC]] threshold. Membership in the franc zone, the main anchor of stability, has nevertheless helped contain pressures on domestic prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/comoros/comoros-financial-sector-profile.html|title=Comoros: Financial Sector Profile|publisher=mfw4a.org|accessdate=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513113341/http://www.mfw4a.org/comoros/comoros-financial-sector-profile.html|archivedate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comoros has an inadequate transportation system, a young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the labour force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high [[unemployment]], and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture contributes 40% to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and provides most of the exports. 

The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatise commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/comoros|title=Rural Poverty Portal|work=ruralpovertyportal.org|access-date=7 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118042213/https://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/comoros|archive-date=18 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With fewer than a million people, the Comoros is one of the least populous countries in the world, but is also one of the most densely populated, with an average of {{convert|275|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}. In 2001, 34% of the population was considered urban, but that is expected to grow, since rural population growth is negative, while overall population growth is still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (2005) [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WUP2005/2005WUPHighlights_Final_Report.pdf ''World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision and World Urbanization Prospects: The 2005 Revision''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623123645/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WUP2005/2005WUPHighlights_Final_Report.pdf |date=23 June 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic groups ===
The islands of the Comoros share mostly African-Arab origins. One of the largest ethnic groups on the various islands of Comoros remain the [[Shirazis of the Comoros|Shirazi people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates2010p187&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ari Nave|editor1=Anthony Appiah|editor2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=187–188|access-date=14 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323150730/https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC|archive-date=23 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities include [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] (Christian) and [[Ethnic Groups of South Asia|Indian]] (mostly [[Ismaili]]), as well as other minorities mostly descended from early French settlers. [[Chinese people]] are also present in parts of Grande Comore (especially Moroni). A small [[White African|white minority]] of [[French people|French]] with other European (i.e. Dutch, British and Portuguese) ancestry lives in the Comoros. Most French left after independence in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Languages ===
{{Further|Languages of the Comoros}}

The most common [[Languages of the Comoros|language in the Comoros]] is [[Comorian language|Comorian]], or ''Shikomori''. It is a language related to [[Swahili language|Swahili]], with four different variants (Shingazidja, Shimwali, Shinzwani and Shimaore) being spoken on each of the four islands. [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts are both used, Arabic being the more widely used, and an [[Official script|official orthography]] has recently been developed for the Latin script.&lt;ref name=chamanga&gt;{{cite book|author= Mohamed Ahmed-Chamanga |title= Introduction à la grammaire structurale du comorien|place= Moroni|publisher= Komedit|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] are also official languages, along with Comorian. Arabic is widely known as a second language, being the language of Quranic teaching. French is the administrative language and the language of all non-Quranic formal education.

== Education ==
{{Further|Education in the Comoros}}
Almost all of the educated populace of the Comoros have attended [[Quranic school]]s at some point in their lives, often before regular schooling. Here, boys and girls are taught about the [[Qur'an]], and memorise it. Some parents specifically choose this early schooling to offset French schools children usually attend later. Since independence and the ejection of French teachers, the education system has been plagued by poor teacher training and poor results, though recent stability may allow for substantial improvements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakar:181-191&quot; /&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a decades-old book, but this purports to describe the current situation.|date=September 2018}}

Pre-colonization education systems in Comoros focused on necessary skills such as agriculture, caring for livestock and completing household tasks. Religious education also taught children the virtues of Islam. The education system underwent a transformation during colonization in the early 1900s which brought secular education based on the French system. This was mainly for children of the elite. After Comoros gained independence in 1975, the education system changed again. Funding for teachers' salaries was lost, and many went on strike. Thus, the public education system was not functioning between 1997 and 2001. Since gaining independence, the education system has also undergone a democratization and options exist for those other than the elite. Enrollment has also grown.

In 2000, 44.2% of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources. [[Salaries]] for teachers are often so far in arrears that many refuse to work.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;&quot;Comoros&quot;.

Prior to 2000, students seeking a university education had to attend school outside of the country, however in the early 2000s a university was created in the country. This served to help economic growth and to fight the &quot;flight&quot; of many educated people who were not returning to the islands to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univ-comores.km|title=Université des Comores|website=Univ-comores.km|accessdate=12 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503010516/http://www.univ-comores.km/|archive-date=3 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About fifty-seven percent of the population is literate in the [[Latin script]] while more than 90% are literate in the [[Arabic script]]; total literacy is estimated at 77.8%.{{clarify|reason=self-contradictory|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.unesco.org/profiles/EN/EDU/countryProfile_en.aspx?code=1740 UNESCO Institute for Statistics, country profile of Comoros; 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231044041/http://www.uis.unesco.org/profiles/EN/EDU/countryProfile_en.aspx?code=1740 |date=31 December 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Comorian has no native script, but both Arabic and Latin scripts are used.

There are two types of marriages in Comoros, the ''Mna daho'' (little marriage) and the ''ada'' (grand marriage). The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. It is small, intimate, and inexpensive. The bride's dowry is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple can afford the ''ada'', or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bridal dowry. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride's family typically pays only a third of that of the groom's. The grand wedding can cost up to £55,000 (74,000 US dollars).{{Dubious|date=June 2018}} Many men cannot afford this until their late 40s, if ever.

The grand marriage is a symbol of social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ''ada'' marriage also greatly increases a man's standing in the Comorian hierarchy. A Comorian man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man until he has had an ''ada'' marriage.

The continuation of the grand marriage tradition is criticized because of its great expense and Comoros's intense poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |title=Two Marriage Forms in the Comoro Islands: An Investigation |language=en|id={{ProQuest|1298706914}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Kinship and social structure ===
[[File:JOUR DE L'AÏDE DHUL HAJJ BANGOI-KOUNI.jpg|thumb|Comorians]]
Comorian society has a [[bilateral descent]] system. Lineage membership and inheritance of immovable goods (land, housing) is matrilineal, passed in the maternal line, similar to many [[Bantu peoples]] who are also matrilineal, while other goods and patronymics are passed in the male line. However, there are differences between the islands, the matrilineal element being stronger on Ngazidja. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
