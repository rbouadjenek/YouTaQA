The [[Central African Republic]] is a landlocked nation within the interior of the [[Africa|African continent]]. It is bordered by the countries of [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau savanna, about {{convert|1640|ft|m|0}} above sea level. In the northeast are the [[Fertit Hills]], and there are scattered hills in the southwestern part of the country. To the northwest are the [[Karre Mountains]] (also known as Yade Massif), a granite plateau with an altitude of {{convert|3750|ft|m|0}}.

At {{convert|622984|km2|sqmi|0}}, the Central African Republic is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's 45th-largest country]] (after [[Somalia]]). It is comparable in size to [[Ukraine]] or slightly smaller than the US state of [[Texas]].

Much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the [[Congo River]], with the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merging with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]]. In the west, the [[Sangha River]] flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Congo-Nile watershed]].

Estimates of the amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8%, with the densest parts in the south. The forest is highly diverse, and includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapelli and Sipo. The [[deforestation]] rate is 0.4% per annum, and lumber poaching is commonplace.

== Climate ==

{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
The climate of the C.A.R. is generally [[tropical]]. The northern areas are subject to [[harmattan]] winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The tip of the northern regions have been subject to [[desertification]]. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers. About one third of the Central African Republic's population do not have access to clean water.
