{{short description|The study of the structure of organisms and their parts}}
[[File:Vesalius-copy.jpg|thumb|One of the large, detailed illustrations in [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' 16th century, marking the rebirth of anatomy|245x245px]]
'''Anatomy''' (Greek anatomē, &quot;dissection&quot;) is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booktionary.com.ng/index_files/Page1935.htm|title=Anatomy|last=Rotimi|first=Booktionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is inherently tied to [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[phylogeny]],&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;. Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate =19 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070316005206/http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| archivedate= 16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Anatomy and [[physiology]], which study (respectively) the structure and [[function (biology)|function]] of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of [[multidisciplinary approach|related disciplines]], and they are often studied together. [[Human body|Human anatomy]] is one of the essential [[basic sciences]] that are [[Applied science|applied]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Arráez-Aybar et al. (2010). Relevance of human anatomy in daily clinical practice. Annals of Anatomy-Anatomischer Anzeiger, 192(6), 341–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy is divided into [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] and [[microscopic scale|microscopic anatomy]]. Macroscopic anatomy, or [[gross anatomy]], is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided [[eyesight]]. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of [[superficial anatomy]]. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of various structures, known as [[histology]], and also in the study of [[cell biology|cells]].

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and structures of the [[human body]]. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and [[cadaver]]s (corpses) to 20th century [[medical imaging]] techniques including [[Radiography|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

Derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατομή}} ''anatomē'' &quot;dissection&quot; (from {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω}} ''anatémnō'' &quot;I cut up, cut open&quot; from ἀνά ''aná'' &quot;up&quot;, and τέμνω ''témnō'' &quot;I cut&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;O.D.E. 2nd edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt; anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of [[organism]]s including their systems, organs and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]], which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of [[bile]], the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia: Anatomy |editor-last=Bozman |editor-first=E. F.|year=1967 |publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Sons |asin=B0066E44EC |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/microscopic+anatomy |title=Anatomy |year=2007 |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes [[superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, along with [[histology]] (the study of tissues), and [[embryology]] (the study of an organism in its immature condition).&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt;

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro HGray&quot; /&gt; Methods used include [[dissection]], in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and [[endoscopy]], in which a [[video camera]]-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. [[Angiography]] using [[X-ray]]s or [[magnetic resonance angiography]] are methods to visualize blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Use of Angiography to Outline the Cardiovascular Anatomy of the Sand Crab Portunus pelagicus Linnaeus |vauthors=Gribble N, Reynolds K | journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology | year=1993 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=627–637 | doi=10.1163/193724093x00192 | jstor=1549093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Characterization of the Renal Portal System of the Common Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) by Digital Subtraction Imaging |vauthors=Benson KG, Forrest L | journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine | year=1999 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=235–241|pmid=10484138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/magnetic_resonance_angiography_mra_135,14/ |title=Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) |publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angiography/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Angiography | publisher=National Health Service | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;anatomy&quot; is commonly taken to refer to [[human anatomy]]. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term ''zootomy'' is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in [[plant anatomy]].&lt;ref name=Everyman/&gt;

== Animal tissues ==
[[File:Anima cell notext.svg|right|thumb|Stylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell (with flagella)]]
The [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animalia]] contains [[multicellular organism]]s that are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[Motility|motile]] (although some have secondarily adopted a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and these animals are also known as [[eumetazoa]]ns. They have an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings; the [[gamete]]s are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the [[zygote]]s include a [[blastula]] stage in their [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Metazoans do not include the [[sponge]]s, which have undifferentiated cells.&lt;ref name=Dorit549&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/547 547–549] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[plant cell]]s, [[animal cells]] have neither a cell wall nor [[chloroplast]]s. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s and [[skin]]. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of [[phospholipid]]s, [[cytoplasm]] and a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].  All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic [[germ layer]]s. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called [[diploblasty|diploblastic]] and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called [[triploblasty|triploblastic]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert60&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=59–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[nervous tissue]].
[[File:Cartilage polarised.jpg|thumb|Hyaline cartilage at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]

===Connective tissue===
[[Connective tissue]]s are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the [[extracellular matrix]]. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, [[adipose tissue]], fibrous connective tissue, [[cartilage]] and [[bone]]. The extracellular matrix contains [[protein]]s, the chief and most abundant of which is [[collagen]]. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a [[skeleton]] to support or protect the body. An [[exoskeleton]] is a thickened, rigid [[cuticle]] which is stiffened by [[mineralisation (biology)|mineralization]], as in [[crustacean]]s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in [[insect]]s. An [[endoskeleton]] is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert60&quot; /&gt;

===Epithelium===
[[File:Normal gastric mucosa low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Gastric mucosa at low magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Epithelial tissue]] is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by [[cell adhesion molecule]]s, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] (flat), [[Simple cuboidal epithelium|cuboidal]] or [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] and rest on a [[basal lamina]], the upper layer of the [[basement membrane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=1002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the [[respiratory tract]] there is a type of [[pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium|ciliated]] epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are [[Microvillus|microvilli]] on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are [[Intestinal villus|intestinal villi]]. [[Skin]] consists of an outer layer of [[keratin]]ized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. [[Keratinocyte]]s make up to 95% of the cells in the [[epidermis (skin)|skin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M. (2004). Rook's Textbook of Dermatology (7th ed.). Blackwell Publishing. pp. 3.1–3.6. {{ISBN|978-0-632-06429-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a [[cuticle]]. In simple animals this may just be a coat of [[glycoproteins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert60&quot; /&gt; In more advanced animals, many [[gland]]s are formed of epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular%20Epithelium.html |title=Glandular epithelium |author=Bernt, Karen |year=2010 |work=Epithelial Cells |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=25 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722064127/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular |archive-date=22 July 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle tissue===
[[File:Skeletal muscle - cross section, nerve bundle.jpg|right|thumb|Cross section through [[skeletal muscle]] and a small [[nerve]] at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Myocyte|Muscle cells]] (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. [[Muscle tissue]] functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three main types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]]. Smooth muscle has no [[Striated muscle tissue|striations]] when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as [[sea anemone]] tentacles and the body wall of [[sea cucumber]]s. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in [[earthworm]]s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.&lt;ref name=Ruppert103&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the [[uterus]], [[bladder]], [[intestines]], [[stomach]], [[oesophagus]], [[respiratory airways]], and [[blood vessel]]s. [[Cardiac muscle]] is found only in the [[heart]], allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

===Nervous tissue===
{{See also|Neuroanatomy}}
[[Nervous tissue]] is composed of many nerve cells known as [[neuron]]s which transmit information. In some slow-moving [[Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] marine animals such as [[ctenophore]]s and [[cnidarian]]s (including [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]]), the nerves form a [[nerve net]], but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along [[biological neural network|neural networks]] to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in [[Ganglion|ganglia]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert104&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) and a [[peripheral nervous system]]. The latter consists of [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerves]] that transmit information from sense organs and [[Motor neuron|motor nerves]] that influence target organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grey's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied |year=1944 |edition=28 |page=1038 |publisher=Langmans |editor1-last=Johnston | editor1-first= T.B |editor2-last=Whillis | editor2-first=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruppert107&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral nervous system is divided into the [[somatic nervous system]] which conveys sensation and controls [[voluntary muscle]], and the [[autonomic nervous system]] which involuntarily controls [[smooth muscle]], certain glands and internal organs, including the [[stomach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.inkling.com/read/essential-clinical-anatomy-keith-moore-4th/introduction-to-clinical-anatomy/nervous-system | title=Essesntial Clinical Anatomy | publisher=Inkling | work=Nervous System | date=2010 |edition=4th | accessdate=30 April 2014 |author1=Moore, K. |author2=Agur, A. |author3=Dalley, A.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
{{see also|Comparative anatomy}}
[[File:VolRenderShearWarp.gif|thumb|upright|[[Mouse]] skull]]
All [[vertebrate]]s have a similar basic [[body plan]] and at some point in their lives, mostly in the [[embryogenesis|embryonic]] stage, share the major [[chordate]] characteristics; a stiffening rod, the [[notochord]]; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the [[neural tube]]; [[pharyngeal arch]]es; and a tail posterior to the anus. The [[spinal cord]] is protected by the [[vertebral column]] and is above the notochord and the [[Gut (anatomy)|gastrointestinal tract]] is below it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |title=Vertebrates: More on Morphology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertmm.html |publisher=UCMP |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nervous tissue is derived from the [[ectoderm]], connective tissues are derived from [[mesoderm]], and gut is derived from the [[endoderm]]. At the posterior end is a [[tail]] which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the [[anus]] at the base of the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Body |last=Romer |first=Alfred Sherwood |year=1985 |publisher=Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston |isbn=978-0-03-058446-6 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the [[vertebral column]], formed in the development of the segmented series of [[vertebra]]e. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the [[nucleus pulposus]] of the [[intervertebral disc]]s. However, a few vertebrates, such as the [[sturgeon]] and the [[coelacanth]] retain the notochord into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Functional anatomy of the vertebrates: an evolutionary perspective|year=2001|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=978-0-03-022369-3|author=Liem, Karel F.|author2=Warren Franklin Walker|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by [[Charles Darwin]] to support his theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/evolution/science/what-is-homology |title=What is Homology? |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish anatomy ===
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[File:Internal anatomy of a fish (cutaway diagram).jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway diagram showing various organs of a fish]]
The body of a [[fish]] is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in [[cartilaginous fish]], or bone in [[bony fish]]. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating [[vertebra]]e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the [[caudal fin]]s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.&lt;ref name=Dorit818/&gt; The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the [[gill]]s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |title=The fish heart |work=ThinkQuest |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=27 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428001536/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |archivedate=28 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or [[middle ear]]. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the [[lateral line]] system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.&lt;ref name=Dorit818&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

Sharks and rays are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] fish with numerous [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal [[placoid scales]]. They have a [[cloaca]] into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a [[swim bladder]]. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, [[Egg yolk|yolky]] eggs. Some species are [[ovoviviparous]] and the young develop internally but others are [[oviparous]] and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.&lt;ref name=Kotpal&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates |last=Kotpal |first=R.

The bony fish lineage shows more [[Derived trait|derived]] anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping [[Fish scale|scales]]. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.&lt;ref name=Kotpal/&gt;

[[Amphibian]]s are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of animals comprising [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, but contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and [[metabolic waste#nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste products]] are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Amphibians breathe by means of [[buccal pumping]], a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble [[earthworm]]s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C.

'''[[Reptile]]s''' are a class of animals comprising [[turtle]]s, [[tuatara]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and [[crocodile]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[lizard]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their [[lung]]s by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].&lt;ref name=Dorit865&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/861 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

'''[[Turtles]]''' are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.&lt;ref name=Dorit868&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/865 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

'''[[Tuataras]]''' superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the [[Triassic]] period. There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''[[Lizards]]''' have skulls with only one [[Nasal fenestra|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''[[Snakes]]''' are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent &quot;spectacle&quot; scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.&lt;ref name=Dorit870&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/870 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

'''[[Crocodilians]]''' are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.&lt;ref name=Dorit874&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/874 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

=== Bird anatomy ===
{{main|Bird anatomy}}
[[File:Duerer wing of a blue roller.jpg|thumb|Part of a wing. [[Albrecht Dürer]], c.&amp;nbsp;1500–1512]]
[[Birds]] are [[tetrapod]]s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are [[wing]]s covered with [[feather]]s and adapted for flight. Birds are [[endotherm]]ic, have a high [[metabolic rate]], a light [[Skeleton|skeletal system]] and powerful [[muscle]]s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.&lt;ref name=Dorit895&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/881 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

The feathers are outgrowths of the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]]. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.&lt;ref name=Dorit895/&gt;

=== Mammal anatomy ===
{{Main|Mammal anatomy}}
[[Mammal]]s are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialized as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.&lt;ref name=Dorit914&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/909 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

Mammals are [[amniote]]s, and most are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying [[monotreme]]s, the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s of Australia. Most other mammals have a [[placenta]] through which the developing [[foetus]] obtains nourishment, but in [[marsupial]]s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] where it latches on to a [[nipple]] and completes its development.&lt;ref name=Dorit914/&gt;

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a [[human head|head]], [[neck]], [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] (which includes the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]), two [[arm]]s and [[hand]]s, and two [[human leg|legs]] and [[foot|feet]].

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[podiatry|podiatrists]], and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.

Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.&lt;ref name=AAA/&gt;

== Invertebrate anatomy ==
[[File:Chirocephalus diaphanus male head.png|thumb|Head of a male ''[[Daphnia]]'', a [[planktonic]] crustacean]]
[[Invertebrate]]s constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular [[eukaryote]]s such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' to such complex multicellular animals as the [[octopus]], [[lobster]] and [[dragonfly]]. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell [[protozoa]]ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by [[Cilium|cilia]] or [[Flagellum|flagella]] or may proceed via the advance of [[pseudopodia]], food may be gathered by [[phagocytosis]], energy needs may be supplied by [[photosynthesis]] and the cell may be supported by an [[endoskeleton]] or an [[exoskeleton]]. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metazoa]]ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an [[extracellular matrix]] which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the [[mesoderm]] is present in [[echinoderm]]s, [[sponge]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s. [[Exoskeleton]]s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of [[chitin]] in [[arthropod]]s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). [[Calcium carbonate]] constitutes the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[brachiopod]]s and some tube-building [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[silica]] forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198292/exoskeleton |title=Exoskeleton |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the [[pinacoderm]] of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ([[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]]) and the [[collagen]]ous cuticle of [[annelid]]s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as [[Microvillus|microvilli]], cilia, bristles, [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] and [[tubercle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument |title=Integument |author= Ebling, F.

[[Marcello Malpighi]], the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArberAgnes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arber, Agnes|title= Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694): an essay in comparison|journal= Isis |volume =34|issue=1| pages =7–16|jstor=225992|doi=10.1086/347742|year= 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insect]]s possess [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the [[exoskeleton]], made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and an [[abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.

[[Spider]]s a class of [[arachnid]]s have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a [[cephalothorax]] and an [[abdomen]]. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called [[chelicerae]] which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called [[pedipalp]]s attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the [[palpal bulb|copulatory organ]].

In 1600 BCE, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], an [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Egyptian]] [[Medical manual|medical text]], described the [[heart]], its vessels, [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[kidneys]], [[hypothalamus]], [[uterus]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and showed the [[blood vessel]]s diverging from the heart.

Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world.  Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The [[Hellenistic Egypt]]ian city of [[Alexandria]] was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the [[Ptolemy]] rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.&lt;ref name=Longrigg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longrigg|first1=James|title=Anatomy in Alexandria in the Third Century B.C|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=December 1988|volume=21|issue=4|pages=455–488|jstor=4026964|doi=10.1017/s000708740002536x|pmid=11621690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt; He made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason | first=Stephen F. | title=A History of the Sciences | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso | url-access=registration | publisher=Collier | year=1962 | location = New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso/page/550 550]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for [[body snatching]] activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.&lt;ref name=trafficdead&gt;{{cite book |author=Sappol, Michael |title=A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-691-05925-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even [[anatomy murder]] were practised to obtain cadavers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosner, Lisa. 2010&quot;&gt;Rosner, Lisa. 2010.

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of &quot;pre-clinical&quot; academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].&lt;ref name=pmid1717373426&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Laing MR, Hutchison JD | title = Nineteenth century medical education for tomorrow's doctors | journal = Scottish Medical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–49 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17373426 | doi=10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15712576&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Hutchison JD | title = Sir John Struthers MD FRCS Edin LLD Glasg: Anatomist, zoologist and pioneer in medical education | journal = The Surgeon | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 347–351 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15712576 | doi=10.1016/s1479-666x(04)80035-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53&quot;&gt;McLachlan, J. &amp; Patten, D. 2006.

He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534198/Ignaz-Philipp-Semmelweis |title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica  |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siemens-electron-microscope.jpg|upright|thumb|An electron microscope from 1973]]
Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were [[dissection]] of the dead and [[inspection]], [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] of the living. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of [[histology]] and [[Cell biology|cytology]] began in the late 19th century&lt;ref name=BritMicro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of [[biopsy]] specimens. The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].&lt;ref name=BritMicro/&gt;

Equally important advances have occurred in  ''non-invasive'' techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and used in medical [[radiography]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232044/http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | archive-date=3 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
