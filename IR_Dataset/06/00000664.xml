An '''astronaut''' or '''cosmonaut''' is a person trained by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]]. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists and tourists.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf|title=Astronaut Fact Book|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2006|author=[[NASA]]| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926023336/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf| archivedate= September 26, 2007 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;utah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |title=Former astronaut visits USU |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=The Utah Statesman |year=2005 |author=Marie MacKay |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926175913/http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |archivedate=September 26, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

The criteria for what constitutes [[human spaceflight]] vary, with some focus on the point where the atmosphere becomes so thin that [[centrifugal force]], rather than [[aerodynamic force]], carries a significant portion of the weight of the flight object.

In 1959, when both the United States and [[Soviet Union]] were planning, but had yet to launch humans into space, [[NASA]] Administrator [[T. Keith Glennan]] and his Deputy Administrator, Dr. [[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh Dryden]], discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called ''astronauts'' or ''cosmonauts''. Dryden preferred &quot;cosmonaut&quot;, on the grounds that flights would occur in the ''[[cosmos]]'' (near space), while the &quot;astro&quot; prefix suggested flight to the stars. Most NASA [[Space Task Group]] members preferred &quot;astronaut&quot;, which survived by common usage as the preferred American term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dethloff | first=Henry C. | title=Suddenly Tomorrow Came...

===English===
In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an ''astronaut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54|title=TheSpaceRace.com – Glossary of Space Exploration Terminology|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105031754/http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54|archive-date=January 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning &quot;star&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. The first known use of the term &quot;astronaut&quot; in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his 1930 short story &quot;The Death's Head Meteor&quot;. The word itself had been known earlier; for example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', &quot;astronaut&quot; referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) by [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by &quot;aeronaut&quot;, an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists. An early use of &quot;astronaut&quot; in a non-fiction publication is [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s poem &quot;The Astronaut&quot;, appearing in the November 1934 ''Bulletin of the [[British Interplanetary Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, John L.: ''Into Your Tent'', Plantech (2010): page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known formal use of the term [[astronautics]] in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 1950, and the subsequent founding of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAFpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=IAF History |publisher=[[International Astronautical Federation]] |author=IAF |date=August 16, 2010 |url=http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102624/https://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |archivedate=July 19, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its [[NASA Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Dismukes |first = Kim – NASA Biography Page Curator | title = Astronaut Biographies | publisher = [[Johnson Space Center]], NASA |date = December 15, 2005|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| accessdate = March 6, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307132816/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| archivedate= March 7, 2007 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its [[European Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESApage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The European Astronaut Corps | publisher = [[ESA]] |author=ESA |date = April 10, 2008|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| accessdate = December 28, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054618/http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| archivedate= December 20, 2008 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, an astronaut employed by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor) is called a ''cosmonaut'' in English texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;biopage&quot;/&gt; The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'' ({{lang-ru|космонавт}}, {{IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaft}}), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler,&lt;ref name = &quot;space traveller&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Kotlyakov| first1 = Vladimir| last2 = Komarova| first2 = Anna| title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Geography: in English, Russian, French, Spanish and German|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6DhWw_cYLicC| year = 2006| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-048878-3 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Greek words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning &quot;universe&quot;, and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning &quot;sailor&quot;. Other countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] use variations of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'', such as the [[Poland|Polish]] ''kosmonauta'' (although Polish also uses ''astronauta'', and the two words are considered synonyms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Astronauta a kosmonauta | publisher = [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]] |author=Katarzyna Kłosińska, University of Warsaw |date = 16 December 2016|url = https://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/Astronauta-a-kosmonauta;17329.html| accessdate = April 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Coinage of the term ''kosmonavt'' has been credited to Soviet aeronautics pioneer [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] (1900–1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brzezinski |first=Matthew |authorlink=Matthew Brzezinski |year=2007 |title=Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries That Ignited the Space Age |url= |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |page=108 |isbn=978-0-8050-8147-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=[[Mike Gruntman]] |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XY9KXxF8OEC&amp;pg=PA326 |location=Reston, VA |publisher=[[AIAA]] |page=326 |isbn=9781563477058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cosmonaut was [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot [[Yuri Gagarin]], also the first person in space.

===Other terms===
With the rise of [[space tourism]], [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to use the term &quot;[[spaceflight participant]]&quot; to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

While no nation other than Russia (and previously the Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries, i.e. the Soviet-led [[Interkosmos]] programme. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term ''spationaut'' ([[French language|French]] spelling: {{lang|fr|spationaute}}) is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|spatium}} for &quot;space&quot;, the [[Malay language|Malay]] term {{lang|ms|angkasawan}} was used to describe participants in the [[Angkasawan program]], and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] hope to launch a [[ISRO Orbital Vehicle|spacecraft]] in 2022 that would carry ''vyomanauts'', coined from the [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa|व्योमन्}} ({{lang|sa-Latn|vyoman}} meaning 'sky' or 'space'). In [[Finland]], the NASA astronaut [[Timothy Kopra]], a [[Finnish Americans|Finnish American]], has sometimes been referred to as {{lang|fi|sisunautti}}, from the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word {{lang|fi|[[sisu]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = &quot;Sisunautti&quot; haaveilee uudesta Suomen-matkasta | publisher = [[MTV3]] |author=MTV Uutiset |date = November 1, 2009|url = https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/artikkeli/sisunautti-haaveilee-uudesta-suomen-matkasta/2174370#gs.XWGxvao| accessdate = April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2019 in the United States, astronaut status is conferred on a person depending on the authorizing agency:

The first human in space was Soviet [[Yuri Gagarin]], who was launched on April 12, 1961, aboard [[Vostok 1]] and orbited around the Earth for 108 minutes. The first woman in space was Soviet [[Valentina Tereshkova]], who launched on June 16, 1963, aboard [[Vostok 6]] and orbited Earth for almost three days.

[[Alan Shepard]] became the first American and second person in space on May 5, 1961, on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight aboard ''[[Mercury-Redstone 3|Freedom 7]]''. The first American to orbit the Earth was [[John Glenn]], aboard ''[[Friendship 7]]'' on February 20, 1962. The first American woman in space was [[Sally Ride]], during [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]'s mission [[STS-7]], on June 18, 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;ride1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ride-sk.html|title=Sally K.

Cosmonaut [[Alexei Leonov]] was the first person to conduct an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), (commonly called a &quot;spacewalk&quot;), on March 18, 1965, on the Soviet Union's Voskhod 2 mission.  This was followed two and a half months later by astronaut [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] who made the first American EVA on NASA's Gemini 4 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Going_Out.html|title=Educator Features: Going Out for a Walk|work=NASA|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first manned mission to orbit the Moon, [[Apollo 8]], included American [[William Anders]] who was born in Hong Kong, making him the first Asian-born astronaut in 1968.

The Soviet Union, through its [[Intercosmos]] program, allowed people from other &quot;[[socialism|socialist]]&quot; (i.e. [[Warsaw Pact]] and other Soviet-allied) countries to fly on its missions, with the notable exceptions of [[France]] and [[Austria]] participating in [[Soyuz TM-7]] and [[Soyuz TM-13]], respectively. An example is [[Czechoslovak]] [[Vladimír Remek]], the first cosmonaut from a country other than the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union]] or the [[NASA|United States]], who flew to space in 1978 on a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/remek.htm|title=Vladimir Remek Czech Pilot Cosmonaut|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|year=2007|author=Encyclopedia Astronautica| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100622/http://astronautix.com/astros/remek.htm| archivedate= October 13, 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rakesh Sharma]] became the first Indian citizen to travel to space.

===Duration and distance milestones===
438 days is the longest time spent in space, by Russian [[Valeri Polyakov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;
As of 2006, the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven, a record held by both [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Franklin Chang-Diaz]]. The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was {{convert|401056|km|0|abbr=on}}, when [[Jim Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] went around the Moon during the [[Apollo 13]] emergency.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

===Civilian and non-government milestones===
The first civilian in space was [[Valentina Tereshkova]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |title=Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423074712/http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |archivedate=April 23, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard [[Vostok 6]] (she also became the first woman in space on that mission).
Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which did not accept female pilots at that time. A month later, [[Joseph Albert Walker]] became the first American civilian in space when his [[X-15 Flight 90]] crossed the {{convert|100|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} line, qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Civilians in Space&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Space.com Joseph A Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight. 
The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both [[Konstantin Feoktistov]] and [[Boris Yegorov]] aboard [[Voskhod 1]].

The first non-governmental space traveler was [[Byron K. Lichtenberg]], a researcher from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who flew on [[STS-9]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;lichten&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/lichtenberg-bk.html|title=Byron K.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for [[extravehicular activity]] in a facility such as NASA's [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot;/&gt; Astronauts-in-training (astronaut candidates) may also experience short periods of [[weightlessness]] ([[Micro-g environment|microgravity]]) in an aircraft called the &quot;[[Vomit Comet]],&quot; the nickname given to a pair of modified [[KC-135]]s (retired in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]) which perform [[Parabola|parabolic]] flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;comet&quot;/&gt; Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in [[T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft]] out of [[Ellington Field]], due to its proximity to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].  Ellington Field is also where the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

Astronauts in training must learn how to control and fly the Space Shuttle and, it is vital that they are familiar with the International Space Station so they know what they must do when they get there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Astronauts_in_Training.html|title=NASA – Astronauts in Training|website=www.nasa.gov|others=Denise Miller: MSFC|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last decade, flight surgeons and scientists at NASA have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long-duration space missions. The syndrome, known as visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), has been reported in nearly two-thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

On November 2, 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the [[brain]] have been found in astronauts who have taken [[Human spaceflight|trips in space]], based on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies]].

Being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body. It can affect the [[otolith]] organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system.

A recent study by Russian scientists published in April 2019 stated that astronauts facing space radiation could face temporary hindrance of their memory centres. While this does not affect their intellectual capabilities, it temporarily hinders formation of new cells in brain's memory centers. The study conducted by Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) concluded this after they observed that mice exposed to neutron and gamma radiation did not impact the rodents' intellectual capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/health/article/radiation-can-impact-astronauts-memory-temporarily-heres-all-you-need-to-know/397216|title=Radiation can impact astronauts' memory temporarily: Here's all you need to know {{!}} Health Tips and News|website=www.timesnownews.com|access-date=2019-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AstronautsEatingBurgers.jpg|thumb|right|Astronauts making and eating hamburgers on board the ISS, August 2007.]]

==Food and drink==

{{main|Space food}}

An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about {{cvt|830|g|oz|lk=on}} mass of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day. (The packaging mass for each meal is about {{cvt|120|g|oz|disp=or}}) Longer-duration missions require more food.

Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician. Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment.  Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (BEE) formula.
On Earth, the average American uses about {{convert|35|USgal|L}} of water every day.  On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about {{convert|3|USgal|L|spell=in}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Needs: Sustaining Life During Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA - Astropin.png|left|thumb|NASA Astronaut lapel pin]]

==Insignia==
In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].  This follows the practice established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed {{convert|50|mi|km}} in altitude.

[[File:amf space mirror.jpg|right|thumb|Space Mirror Memorial]]

==Deaths==
{{Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities}}

Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American (including one born in India), four were Russian ([[Soviet Union]]), and one was Israeli.

Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.

The [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian [[spaceflight participant]].
