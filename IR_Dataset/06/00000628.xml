'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley |editor-last=Watt |editor-first=Donald |publisher=Routledge |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-415-15915-9 |page=366 |quote=Inge's agreement with Huxley on several essential points indicates the respect Huxley's position commanded from some important philosophers … And now we have a book by Aldous Huxley, duly labelled ''The Perennial Philosophy''. … He is now quite definitely a mystical philosopher. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8PHKq723vpUC&amp;pg=PA366 |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley and the Search for Meaning: A Study of the Eleven Novels |last=Sion |first=Ronald T. |date=2010 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-7864-4746-6 |page=2 |quote=Aldous Huxley, as a writer of fiction in the 20th century, willingly assumes the role of a modern philosopher-king or literary prophet by examining the essence of what it means to be human in the modern age. … Huxley was a prolific genius who was always searching throughout his life for an understanding of self and one's place within the universe. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77ithOrxlgMC&amp;pg=PA2 |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World |last=Reiff |first=Raychel Haugrud |year=2010 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation |isbn=978-0-7614-4278-3 |page=7 |quote=He was also a philosopher, mystic, social prophet, political thinker, and world traveler who had a detailed knowledge of music, medicine, science, technology, history, literature and Eastern religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley: A Biography |last=Sawyer |first=Dana |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8245-1987-2 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uIdAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=aldous+huxley+philosopher&amp;dq=aldous+huxley+philosopher|accessdate=10 April 2016 |quote=Huxley was a philosopher but his viewpoint was not determined by the intellect alone.

Born into the prominent [[Huxley family]], he graduated from [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] with an undergraduate degree in English literature. Early in his career, he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', before going on to publish travel writing, [[satire]], and [[screenplays]]. He spent the latter part of his life in the United States, living in [[Los Angeles]] from 1937 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8751943/The-Britons-who-made-their-mark-on-LA.html |title=The Britons who made their mark on LA |date=2011-09-11 |access-date=2018-07-05 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Thody, Philipe (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] seven times&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4397 &quot;Nomination Database: Aldous Huxley&quot;].

&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a [[humanist]] and [[pacifist]]. He grew interested in philosophical [[mysticism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thody |first=Philipe |title=Huxley: A Biographical Introduction |year=1973 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0-289-70188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David K.

In his most famous novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) and his final novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), he presented his vision of [[dystopia]] and [[utopia]], respectively.

Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley,]] who edited ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.nls.uk/jma/topics/publishing/cornhill.html |title=Cornhill Magazine |last= |first= |date= |website=National Library of Scotland |access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded [[Prior's Field School]]. Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphry Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[Zoology|zoologist]], agnostic, and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevenen Huxley (1889–1914), who took his own life after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Huxley's nickname was &quot;Ogie&quot;, short for &quot;Ogre&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley |last=Bedford |first=Sybille |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf / Harper &amp; Row |year=1974 |isbn= |location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by his brother, Julian, as someone who frequently &quot;[contemplated] the strangeness of things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; According to his cousin and contemporary, Gervas Huxley, he had an early interest in drawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, after which he enrolled at Hillside School near [[Godalming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hull |first=James |title=Aldous Huxley, Representative Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bX3EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2004 |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |isbn=978-3-8258-7663-0 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rintoul2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=M.C.

After Hillside he went on to [[Eton College]]. His mother died in 1908, when he was 14 (his [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|father]] later remarried). {{anchor|Aldous Huxley eye disease}}He contracted the eye disease [[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]] in 1911; this &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |year=1939 |chapter=Biography and bibliography (appendix) |title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan |series=1st Perennial Classic |page=243 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Brave New World |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics / HarperCollins Publishers |year=2006 |isbn= |location= |pages= |chapter=Aldous Huxley: A Life of the Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1913, Huxley entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he studied English literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; He volunteered for the [[British Army]] in January 1916, for the [[World War I|Great War]]; however, he was rejected on health grounds, being half-blind in one eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot;&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 112. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt; His eyesight later partly recovered. He edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' in 1916, and in June of that year graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|first class honours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; His brother Julian wrote:

{{Quote|I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career&amp;nbsp;... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following his years at Balliol, Huxley, being financially indebted to his father, decided to find employment. He taught French for a year at [[Eton College]], where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name [[George Orwell]]) and [[Steven Runciman]] were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class. Nevertheless, Blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Crick |first=Bernard |title=George Orwell: A Life |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-014563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at [[Tata Chemicals Europe|Brunner and Mond]], an advanced chemical plant in [[Billingham]] in County Durham, northeast England. According to the introduction to the latest edition of his science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932), the experience he had there of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was an important source for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baggini |first=Julian |title=Atheism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=978-1-4027-6882-8 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Aldous Huxley 1927.png|thumb|left|upright|Painting of Huxley in 1927 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]]]]
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early twenties, establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist. His first published novels were social satires, ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was his fifth novel and first dystopian work. In the 1920s he was also a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']] magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley: Selected Letters&quot;. p. 144. Ivan R. Dee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contact with the Bloomsbury Set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]]]]
During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]] near Oxford, home of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. There he met several [[Bloomsbury Group]] figures, including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Weber |first=Michel |author-link=Michel Weber |url=https://www.academia.edu/3268912 |title=On Religiousness and Religion.

A Journal of Twentieth-Century Thought and Beyond |volume=5 |place=Münster |publisher=LIT |date=March 2005 |pages=117–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clive Bell]]. Later, in ''Crome Yellow'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 [[John Middleton Murry]] was reorganising the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Huxleys |first=Ronald W |last=Clark |publisher=William Heinemann |place=London |year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Woodcock |year=2007 |title=Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley |page=240 |publisher=Black Rose Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''Brave New World'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]], and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Beginning in this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate=6 June 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life in the United States ===
In 1937 Huxley moved to [[Hollywood]] with his wife Maria, son [[Matthew Huxley]], and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, and also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. Huxley and Krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange (sometimes edging on debate) over many years, with Krishnamurti representing the more rarefied, detached, ivory-tower perspective and Huxley, with his pragmatic concerns, the more socially and historically informed position. Huxley provided an introduction to Krishnamurti's quintessential statement, ''The First and Last Freedom'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Roland (2000) ''Star in the East'', pp. 204-207. Sentient Publications: Boulder, CO&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley also became a Vedantist in the circle of [[Hindu]] [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long afterward, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of [[Los Angeles]]. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''My Guru and His Disciple'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the US. In March 1938, Huxley's friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), which hired him for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). He was commissioned by [[Walt Disney]] in 1945 to write a script based on ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and the biography of the story's author, [[Lewis Carroll]]. The script was not used, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/ |title=7 unproduced screenplays by famous intellectuals |date=2010-04-15 |work=Salon |access-date=2018-02-25 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of [[J. D. Unwin]]'s 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=JD |last=Unwin |title=Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society |year=1940 |publisher=Oscar Piest |place=NY}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to George Orwell, author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is.&quot; In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:
{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and [[wikt:narcohypnosis|narcohypnosis]] are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0-7011-1312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall semester of 1960, Huxley was invited by Professor [[Huston Smith]] to be the Carnegie Visiting Professor of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lionsroar.com/huston-smith-fifty-years-on-the-razors-edge/ Interview of Huston Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the MIT centennial program of events organized by the Department of Humanities, Huxley presented a series of lectures titled, &quot;What a Piece of Work is a Man&quot; which concerned history, language, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/761|title=Aldous Huxley lecture series, &quot;What a Piece of Work Is a Man&quot;|last=|first=|date=|website=archivesspace.mit.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-World War II life ===
In 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the U.S. and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]], the judge had to adjourn the proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Raychel Haugrud Reiff|title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JyRntokmqYC&amp;pg=PA31|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4701-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Nicholas|title=Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h7CKgXGDi4C&amp;pg=PT309|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1231-9|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the U.S. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]] without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''. (2003). Volume 6. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood and other followers, he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |last2=Swami Prabhavananda |last3=Aldous |first3=Huxley |title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God |year=1987 |publisher=Vedanta Press |location=Hollywood, Calif |isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by the Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright [[John Van Druten]] from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''[[Knowledge and Understanding]]'' and ''[[Who Are We? (album)|Who Are We?]]'' from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalised religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Weber]], &quot; [https://www.academia.edu/1564486/_Perennial_Truth_and_Perpetual_Perishing._A._Huxleys_Worldview_in_the_Light_of_A._N._Whiteheads_Process_Philosophy_of_Time_2007_ Perennial Truth and Perpetual Perishing.

== Psychedelic drug use and mystical experiences==
{{See also|The Doors of Perception}}
In the spring of 1953, Huxley had his first experience with the [[psychedelic drug]] [[mescaline]]. Huxley had initiated a correspondence with Doctor [[Humphry Osmond]], a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution, and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline; Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley's session in southern California. After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', in which he recounted this experience, Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions. Huxley later had an [[The Doors of Perception#Later experience|experience on mescaline]] that he considered more profound than those detailed in ''The Doors of Perception''.

Huxley wrote that &quot;The mystical experience is doubly valuable; it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self-centered and more creative life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, &quot;Moksha: Aldous Huxley's Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eyesight ==
[[File:Aldous Huxley 1947.png|thumb|upright|Huxley in 1947, his right eye affected by [[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]] he contracted in 1911]]
Differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. In about 1939 Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northern [[Los Angeles County]]. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley Annual |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYFcahCQm4wC&amp;pg=PA109 |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |date=28 February 2011 |isbn=978-3-643-10450-2 |language=en |first=Bernfried |last=Nugel |first2=Jerome |last2=Meckier |page=111 |chapter=A New Look at The Art of Seeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since [[#Aldous Huxley eye disease|the illness in his teens]], despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;Cerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Gardner |title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-20394-2|title-link=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian author [[João Ubaldo Ribeiro]], who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the Huxleys' company in the late 1950s, wrote that Huxley had said to him, with a wry smile, &quot;I can hardly see at all. And I don't give a damn, really&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=O Conselheiro Come |publisher=Editora Nova Fronteira |date=2000 |isbn=978-85-209-1069-6 |language=pt |page=[https://archive.org/details/oconselheirocome00ribe/page/92 92] |url=https://archive.org/details/oconselheirocome00ribe/page/92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]], later emphasised in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight&quot;. After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempered her statement with, &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Laura |title=This Timeless Moment |url=https://archive.org/details/thistimelessmome00huxl |url-access=registration |year=1968 |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-89087-968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, agrees with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable&quot;. Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary LA'' p. 50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[popular science]] author [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]], in his book ''Mind Wide Open'', quotes Huxley about his difficulties with [[Encoding (memory)#Visual encoding|visual encoding]]: &quot;I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of poets, [[Aphantasia|do not evoke pictures in my mind]]. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon&amp;nbsp;...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, ''The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell'', Harper Perennial, 1963, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author) |title=Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life |location=New York |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mindwideopen00stev/page/235 235] |isbn=978-0-7432-4165-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/mindwideopen00stev/page/235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Huxley married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at [[Garsington]], Oxfordshire, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html &quot;Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84&quot;.] 17 February 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Maria Huxley died of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, Huxley married Laura Archera (1911–2007), also an author, as well as a violinist and psychotherapist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. She told the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, ''Huxley on Huxley''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/ |title=Huxley on Huxley. |others=Dir.

Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]] in 1960; in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; both at the [[UCSF Medical Center]] and at the [[Esalen Institute]]. These lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the [[Human Potential Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kripal |first=Jeffrey |title=Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007}}[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/453699.html excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a close friend of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Rosalind Rajagopal]] and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School, now [[Besant Hill School]] of Happy Valley, in [[Ojai, California]].

The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers, following the destruction of most in a fire, is at the [[University of California, Los Angeles Library|Library of the University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1489q14s/ |title=Finding Aid for the Aldous and Laura Huxley papers, 1925–2007 |publisher=Special Collections, [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are also at the [[Stanford University Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findingaids.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=ead/mss/m0107.xml |title=Guide to the Aldous Huxley Collection, 1922–1934 |publisher=Dept. of Special Collections and University Archives |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 1962, Huxley was informed he was elected Companion of Literature by the [[Royal Society of Literature]], the senior literary organisation in Britain, and he accepted the title via letter on 28 April 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot;&gt;Peter Edgerly Firchow, Hermann Josef Real (2005). ''The Perennial Satirist: Essays in Honour of Bernfried Nugel, Presented on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday'', p. 1. LIT Verlag Münster&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence between Huxley and the society are kept at the [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt; The society invited Huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at [[Somerset House]], London in June 1963. Huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society; however, his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt;

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak owing to advanced laryngeal cancer, Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for &quot;[[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], 100 [[Microgram|µg]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]].&quot; According to her account of his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html |title=Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note |publisher=Lettersofnote.com |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. and a second dose an hour later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Los Angeles time), on 22 November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 35. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of Huxley's death, along with that of fellow British author [[C. S. Lewis]], was overshadowed by the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of American President John F. Kennedy]] on the same day, less than seven hours before Huxley's death.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Ruddick (1993). &quot;Ultimate Island: On the Nature of British Science Fiction&quot;. p. 28. Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine titled “The Eclipsed Celebrity Death Club”, Christopher Bonanos wrote,

{{quote|The championship trophy for badly timed death, though, goes to a pair of British writers. Aldous Huxley, the author of ''Brave New World'', died the same day as C. S. Lewis, who wrote the ''Chronicles of Narnia'' series. Unfortunately for both of their legacies, that day was November 22, 1963, just as John Kennedy’s motorcade passed the [[Texas School Book Depository]]. Huxley, at least, made it interesting: At his request, his wife shot him up with LSD a couple of hours before the end, and he tripped his way out of this world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2009/06/the_eclipsed_celebrity_death_c.html?gtm=bottom&amp;gtm=bottom “The Eclipsed Celebrity Death Club”].

This coincidence served as the basis for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]'', which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in Purgatory following their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kreeft |first1=Peter |title=Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F.

How might the conversation go?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's memorial service took place in London in December 1963; it was led by his elder brother Julian. On 27 October 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley: A Biography |last=Murray |first=Nicholas |publisher=St. Martin's Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0312302375 |page=455 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tukmDMYu6ysC&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;dq=(%22Aldous%20Huxley%22%7C%22Huxley%20Aldous%22)%20(%22funeral%22%7C%22burial%22%7C%22buried%22%7C%22interment%22%7C%22interred%22)%201971&amp;pg=PA455#v=onepage&amp;q=%2227%20october%201971%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; his ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in [[Compton, Guildford]], Surrey, England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began ''Variations'' in Santa Fé, New Mexico, in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Robert Craft]].&lt;ref&gt;Spies 1965, 62; White 1979, 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White 1979, 536–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevance to Huxley? : Although not composed for the purpose, Stravinsky's music was twice choreographed for the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, a first version in 1966, and a second version in 1982, both times under the title ''Variations'' (Barnes 1966; Anderson 1982). --&gt;
