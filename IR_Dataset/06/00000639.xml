[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of [[methane]], the simplest alkane]]
In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkane''', or '''paraffin''' (a historical name that also has [[paraffin (disambiguation)|other meanings]]), is an [[open-chain compound|acyclic]] [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]. In other words, an alkane consists of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure in which all the [[carbon–carbon bond]]s are [[single bond|single]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldBook alkanes&quot;/&gt; Alkanes have the general chemical formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;. The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large and complex molecules, like [[pentacontane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;102&lt;/sub&gt;) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, an [[isomer]] of [[tetradecane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[IUPAC]] defines alkanes as &quot;acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula {{Carbon}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;{{Hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms&quot;. However, some sources use the term to denote ''any'' saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the [[cycloalkane]]s) or polycyclic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Hydrocarbons/Alkanes |title=Alkanes|date=28 November 2016|website = Chemistry LibreTexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite their having a different general formula (i.e. cycloalkanes are C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

In an alkane, each carbon atom is [[Orbital hybridization|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized]] with 4 [[sigma bonds]] (either C–C or [[C–H bond|C–H]]), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (in a C–H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its [[skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane.

One group of the [[higher alkanes]] are [[wax]]es, solids at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure]] (SATP), for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.
With their repeated –CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units, the alkanes constitute a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ in [[molecular mass]] by multiples of 14.03&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (the total mass of each such [[methylene bridge|methylene-bridge]] unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01&amp;nbsp;u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01&amp;nbsp;u each).

Methane is produced by [[Methanogen|methanogenic bacteria]] and some long-chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi. Nevertheless, most alkanes do not have much [[biological activity]].  They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive [[functional groups]] of biological molecules.

The alkanes have two main commercial sources: [[petroleum]] (crude oil)&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Hydrocarbons (Alkanes, Alkenes And Alkynes)|author =Arora, A.|date=2006|publisher=Discovery Publishing House Pvt. Limited|isbn=9788183561426|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4vfMv7aP3EC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[natural gas]].

An [[alkyl]] group is an alkane-based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding.  They are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group, R, although Alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group (as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group).

==Structure and classification==

Saturated hydrocarbons are [[hydrocarbon]]s having only single covalent bonds between their carbons. They can be:
* linear (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''+2}}) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure
* branched (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''+2}}, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions
* [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''}}, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.

According to the definition by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called [[cycloalkane]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldBook alkanes&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title=alkanes | file = A00222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula is  {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''−2''k''+2}}, where ''k'' is the number of independent loops. Alkanes are the [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] (loopless) ones, corresponding to ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Isomerism==
[[Image:Saturated C4 hydrocarbons ball-and-stick.png|thumb|right| Different C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes and cycloalkanes (left to right): [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; isomers; [[cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; alkane isomers.&lt;br /&gt; [[Bicyclobutane|Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane]] is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; alkane and has no alkane isomer; [[tetrahedrane]] (below) is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alkane and so has no alkane isomer.]]

[[File:Tetrahedrane-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Tetrahedrane]] ]]

Alkanes with more than three [[carbon]] atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming [[structural isomer]]s. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for &quot;normal&quot;, although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms. For example, for acyclic alkanes:&lt;ref name= OEIS &gt;[[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] {{OEIS|id=A000602}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: [[methane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: [[ethane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: [[propane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: 2 isomers: [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: 3 isomers: [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 isomers: [[hexane]], [[2-Methylpentane|2-methylpentane]], [[3-Methylpentane|3-methylpentane]], [[2,2-Dimethylbutane|2,2-dimethylbutane]], and [[2,3-Dimethylbutane|2,3-dimethylbutane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;: 355 isomers
* C&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;: 27,711,253,769 isomers
* C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: 22,158,734,535,770,411,074,184 isomers, many of which are not stable.

Branched alkanes can be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. For example, [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are chiral due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3. In addition to the alkane isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called [[cycloalkane]]s.  Stereoisomers and cyclic compounds are excluded when calculating the number of isomers above.

==Nomenclature==
{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}
The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Alkanes|IUPAC nomenclature]] (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix &quot;-ane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_184.htm | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | chapter = R-2.2.1: Hydrocarbons | author = IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry | title = A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993) | year = 1993 | publisher = Blackwell Scientific | isbn = 978-0-632-03488-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the [[hydrocarbons]] C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html Alkane Nomenclature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202091842/http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html |date=2 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds;&lt;ref&gt;Thus, the ending &quot;-diene&quot; is applied in some cases where von Hofmann had &quot;-ine&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;-one&quot; represents a [[ketone]]; &quot;-ol&quot; represents an alcohol or OH group; &quot;-oxy-&quot; means an [[ether]] and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxymethane is the IUPAC name for [[dimethyl ether]].

It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.

===Linear alkanes===
&lt;!-- redirected from [[linear paraffins]] --&gt;
Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix &quot;''n''-&quot; (for ''normal'') where a non-linear [[isomer]] exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] or 2- or 3-methylpentane. Alternative names for this group are: '''linear paraffins''' or '''''n''-paraffins'''.

The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
; [[methane]]: CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; – one carbon and 4 hydrogen
; [[ethane]] : C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; – two carbon and 6 hydrogen
; [[propane]]: C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; – three carbon and 8 hydrogen
; [[butane]] : C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; – four carbon and 10 hydrogen
; [[pentane]]: C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; – five carbon and 12 hydrogen
; [[hexane]] : C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; – six carbon and 14 hydrogen

The first four names were [[back-formation|derived]] from [[methanol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]], respectively ([[hexadecane]] is also sometimes referred to as cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[Affix|suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] prefix&lt;ref name=reusch-nom&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Nomenclature – Alkanes | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomen1.htm | access-date = 5 April 2007 | archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160521131930/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomen1.htm | archive-date = 21 May 2016 | url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[elision]] of any terminal vowel (''-a'' or ''-o'') from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; [[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;; [[heptane]], C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;; [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example [[nonane]], use the [[Latin language|Latin]] prefix '''non-'''. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].

===Branched alkanes===
[[Image:Isopentane-numbered-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of [[isopentane]] (common name) or 2-methylbutane (IUPAC systematic name)]]
Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example [[pentane|''n''-pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]].

IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.

The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Examples of the IUPAC Rules in Practice | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomexmp1.htm | access-date = 5 April 2007 | archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160521132003/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomexmp1.htm | archive-date = 21 May 2016 | url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms
* Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules
* Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from &quot;-ane&quot; to &quot;-yl&quot;
* Number the longest continuous chain in order to give the lowest possible numbers for the side-chains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chem.uiuc.edu/GenChemReferences/nomenclature_rules.html|title=IUPAC Rules|website=www.chem.uiuc.edu|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain
* If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as &quot;di-&quot; and &quot;tri-&quot; to indicate it as such, and number each one.
* Add side chain names in alphabetical (disregarding &quot;di-&quot; etc. prefixes) order in front of the name of the root chain

===Saturated cyclic hydrocarbons===
{{Main|Cycloalkane}}

Though technically distinct from the alkanes, this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the &quot;cyclic alkanes.&quot; As their description implies, they contain one or more rings.

Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix &quot;cyclo-&quot; to distinguish them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, [[propane]] and [[cyclopropane]], [[butane]] and [[cyclobutane]], etc.

Substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes – the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules]].&lt;ref name=reusch-nom/&gt;

===Trivial/common names===
{{main|List of straight-chain alkanes}}
The trivial (non-[[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic]]) name for alkanes is 'paraffins'. Together, alkanes are known as the 'paraffin series'. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.

It is almost certain that the term 'paraffin' stems from the [[petrochemical industry]]. Branched-chain alkanes are called '''isoparaffins'''. The use of the term &quot;paraffin&quot; is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of [[isomer]]s, i.e., compounds of the same [[chemical formula]], e.g., [[pentane]] and [[isopentane]].

;In IUPAC
The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system:
* [[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane
* [[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane
* [[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane.

;Non-IUPAC
Some non-IUPAC trivial names are occasionally used:
* cetane, for [[hexadecane]]
* cerane, for [[hexacosane]]&lt;ref&gt;Donald Mackay, ''Handbook of Physical-Chemical Properties and Environmental Fate for Organic Chemicals'', {{isbn|1420044397}}, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boiling point===
[[Image:AlkaneBoilingMeltingPoint.png|right|thumb|400px|Melting (blue) and boiling (orange) points of the first 16 ''n''-alkanes in °C.]]

Alkanes experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s. Stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.&lt;ref name=m&amp;b&gt;{{cite book|title = Organic Chemistry |author1=R. T. Morrison |author2=R. N. Boyd | isbn = 978-0-13-643669-0 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = New Jersey | edition = 6th|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:
* the number of electrons surrounding the [[molecule]], which increases with the alkane's molecular weight
* the surface area of the molecule

Under [[standard conditions]], from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes are gaseous; from C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; they are liquids; and after C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ([[molecular weight]]) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30&amp;nbsp;°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt;

A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at −12 and 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58&amp;nbsp;°C, respectively.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt; For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can &quot;lock&quot; into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.

On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Alkanes/Properties_of_Alkanes/Cycloalkanes/Physical_Properties_of_Cycloalkanes|title=Physical Properties of Cycloalkanes|date=29 November 2015|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012447/https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Alkanes/Properties_of_Alkanes/Cycloalkanes/Physical_Properties_of_Cycloalkanes|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melting points===
The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the &quot;looser&quot; organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain ''n''-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30&amp;nbsp;K and of ''n''-butane to ''n''-nonane at 90&amp;nbsp;K | journal= Angew Chem Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988–992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7&lt;988::AID-ANIE988&gt;3.3.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for [[isoalkanes]] (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.

===Conductivity and solubility===
Alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way, nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason, they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] as they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane–water mixture.

===Molecular geometry===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridization in [[methane]].]]
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−{{sfrac|3}})&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;109.47° between them.

===Bond lengths and bond angles===
An alkane molecule has only C–H and C–C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C–H bond and 1.54&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C–C bond.
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

===Conformation===
{{Main|Alkane stereochemistry}}

The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon–carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].
[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]
[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]

[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].

The two conformations differ in energy: the staggered conformation is 12.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C–C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds.

The case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon–carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

===Spectroscopic properties===
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon–carbon, and carbon–hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a different functional group like [[Alcohol (chemistry)|–OH]], [[Aldehyde|–CHO]], [[Carboxylic acid|–COOH]] etc.

====Infrared spectroscopy====
The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&amp;nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]], while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1375&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

====NMR spectroscopy====
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|''δ''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 0.5–1.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 8–30 (primary, methyl, –CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 15–55 (secondary, methylene, –CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–), 20–60 (tertiary, methyne, C–H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.

====Mass spectrometry====
Alkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (''M''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups.

==Chemical properties==

Alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds. The [[acid dissociation constant]] (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 to 70, depending on the extrapolation method, hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). They are also extremely weak bases, undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid (''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ –12), although [[superacid]]s that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions (see: [[Methanium|methanium ion]]). Similarly, they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents (e.g., [[dioxirane]]s and salts containing the [[Tetrafluoroammonium|NF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation]]).  By virtue of their strongly C–H bonds (~100 kcal/mol) and C–C bonds (~90 kcal/mol, but usually less sterically accessible), they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals, although many electron-deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron-rich bonds (see below). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

[[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.  Moreover, redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced state; in the case of methane, carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state (−4). Reaction with oxygen (''if'' present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction [[stoichiometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Free radical halogenation]] reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of [[haloalkanes]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation|C–H bond activation]] reactions.

In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.

However, in general and perhaps surprisingly, when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable 1,2- and 1,3-alkyl–alkyl steric interactions (worth ~3.1 kcal/mol and ~3.7 kcal/mol in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane, respectively) unavoidable, the branched alkanes are actually more thermodynamically stable than their linear (or less branched) isomers.  For example, the highly branched 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane is about 1.9 kcal/mol more stable than its linear isomer, ''n''-octane.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957525299|title=Stereoelectronic effects : a bridge between structure and reactivity|last=Alabugin, Igor V.

===Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction)===
All alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ({{sfrac|3|2}}''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:or C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ({{sfrac|3''n'' + 1|2}})&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&amp;nbsp;[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;[[carbon monoxide|CO]]

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ({{sfrac|2}}''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&amp;nbsp;[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;[[carbon|C]]

For example, [[methane]]:
:2&amp;nbsp;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;CO + 4&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|3|2}}&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

See the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.
The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;⊖&lt;/sup&gt;, for alkanes increases by about 650&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;⊖&lt;/sup&gt; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

=== Reactions with halogens ===
{{Main|Free radical halogenation}}
Alkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called ''free radical halogenation'' reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:
* '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.
* '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place—the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.
* '''Chain termination''' where the radicals recombine.

Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt;
[[Image:Monobromination of propane.png|500px|center|Monobromination of [[propane]]]]

=== Cracking ===
{{Main|Cracking (chemistry)}}
Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a [[carbocation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C–C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[Intramolecular reaction|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

=== Isomerization and reformation ===
Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Asinger, Friedrich | title = Paraffins; Chemistry and Technology | url = https://archive.org/details/paraffinschemist0000asin | url-access = registration | location = Oxford| publisher = Pergamon Press | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;/&gt; In reformation, the alkanes become [[cycloalkane]]s or [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the [[octane number]] of the substance. Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;/&gt;

===Other reactions===
Alkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can be [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chlorides]]. [[Nucleophilic abstraction|Nucleophilic Abstraction]] can be used to separate an alkane from a metal. Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by [[transmetalation]] reactions. A mixture of [[antimony pentafluoride]] (SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[fluorosulfonic acid]] (HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), called [[magic acid]], can protonate alkanes.&lt;ref name=Olah1968&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[George A.

Uranus and Neptune have more but still small --&gt; of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of the outer gas planets such as [[Jupiter]] (0.1% methane, 2&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] ethane), [[Saturn]] (0.2% methane, 5&amp;nbsp;ppm ethane), [[Uranus]] (1.99% methane, 2.5&amp;nbsp;ppm ethane) and [[Neptune]] (1.5% methane, 1.5&amp;nbsp;ppm ethane). [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]], which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titan: Arizona in an Icebox? |url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_science-results_0121.html |author=Emily Lakdawalla |accessdate=21 January 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406104505/http://planetary.org/news/2005/0121_Titan_Arizona_in_an_Icebox.html |archivedate=6 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on Titan the Cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane/ethane lakes near the polar regions of Titan. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] have also been detected in the tail of the comet [[Hyakutake]]. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;science&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mumma, M.J. | title=Detection of Abundant Ethane and Methane, Along with Carbon Monoxide and Water, in Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake: Evidence for Interstellar Origin | journal=Science | year=1996 | volume=272 | doi=10.1126/science.272.5266.1310 | pmid=8650540 | last2 = Disanti |first2=M.A. |last3=dello Russo |first3=N. |last4=Fomenkova |first4=M. |last5=Magee-Sauer |first5=K. |last6=Kaminski |first6=C.D. |last7=D.X. |first7=Xie | issue=5266 | bibcode=1996Sci...272.1310M | pages=1310–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkanes have also been detected in [[meteorite]]s such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s.

===Occurrence of alkanes on Earth===
Traces of methane gas (about 0.0002% or 1745&amp;nbsp;ppb) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by [[methanogenesis|methanogenic]] microorganisms, such as [[Archaea]] in the gut of ruminants.&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janssen | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Kirs | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Structure of the Archaeal Community of the Rumen | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 74 | issue = 12| pages = 3619–3625 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02812-07 |pmc= 2446570 | pmid=18424540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and [[Petroleum|oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some [[propane]] and [[butane]]: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other [[hydrocarbons]]. These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3&amp;nbsp;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial [[oil fields]]. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]].

Methane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]].

Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane clathrate]] (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is, therefore, a candidate for future fuels.

===Biological occurrence===
Acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways.

;Bacteria and archaea
[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]]
Certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/static/classic_rxns/classic_reactions/fatty_acid_met.html|title=Metabolism of Alkanes and Fatty Acids – eQuilibrator 0.2 beta documentation|website=equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il|language=en|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/marsh-gas|title=Marsh gas - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release 30 to 50 gallons per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/do-cow-farts-actually-contribute-to-global-warming-1562144730|title=Do Cow Farts Actually Contribute to Global Warming?|last=TodayIFoundOut.com|first=Matt Blitz -|work=Gizmodo|access-date=11 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[termite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buczkowski|first=Grzegorz|last2=Bertelsmeier|first2=Cleo|date=15 January 2017|title=Invasive termites in a changing climate: A global perspective|journal=Ecology and Evolution|volume=7|issue=3|pages=974–985|doi=10.1002/ece3.2674|pmc=5288252|pmid=28168033}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/natural-gas/|title=natural gas|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=24 July 2012|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fungi and plants
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.&lt;ref name=Hendey&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N. I. | year = 1964 | title = Some observations on Cladosporium resinae as a fuel contaminant and its possible role in the corrosion of aluminium alloy fuel tanks | journal = Transactions of the British Mycological Society | volume = 47 | issue = 7| pages = 467–475 | doi=10.1016/s0007-1536(64)80024-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, the solid long-chain alkanes are found in the [[plant cuticle]] and [[epicuticular wax]] of many species, but are only rarely major constituents.&lt;ref name=Baker1982&gt;EA Baker (1982) Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes. pp. 139-165. In &quot;The Plant Cuticle&quot;. edited by DF Cutler, KL Alvin and CE Price. Academic Press, London. {{ISBN|0-12-199920-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt; and are made by the plants by [[decarboxylation]] of even-numbered [[fatty acid]]s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt;

More volatile short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues. The [[Jeffrey pine]] is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of ''n''-[[heptane]] in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one [[octane rating]]. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and ''n''-[[nonane]] is a significant component in the scent of some [[rose]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 =HyunJung | last2=Kim | first2=NamSun | last3=Lee | first3=DongSun | year =  2000 | title = Determination of floral fragrances of Rosa hybrida using solid-phase trapping-solvent extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 902 | issue = 2| pages =  389–404 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(00)00863-3 | pmid =11192171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as [[ethane]], [[pentane]], and [[hexane]] by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kesselmeier | first1 = J. | last2 = Staudt | first2 = N. | year = 1999 | title = Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC): An Overview on Emission, Physiology and Ecology | url = http://www.geo.uni-frankfurt.de/iau/epos/Gruppenintern/Kesselmeier___Staudt_JAC_1999.pdf | journal = Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry | volume = 33 | pages = 22–38 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6F5FQG2OP?url=http://www.geo.uni-frankfurt.de/iau/epos/Gruppenintern/Kesselmeier___Staudt_JAC_1999.pdf | archivedate = 13 March 2013| doi = 10.1023/A:1006127516791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers, mainly 8 to 35, usually peaking in the low to upper 20s, with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million by weight) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreda

C. |last3=Cert| first3=A.| year = 2001 | title = Gas and liquid chromatography of hydrocarbons in edible vegetable oils | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 936 | issue =1–2 | pages = 159–171 | doi=10.1016/s0021-9673(01)01222-5| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11596797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Animals
Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% [[pristane]] (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;). They are important as [[pheromone]]s, chemical messenger materials, on which insects depend for communication. In some species, e.g. the support beetle ''[[Xylotrechus colonus]]'', [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;), 3-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) are transferred by body contact. With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;), and acts by smell over longer distances. [[waggle dance|Waggle-dancing]] [[honey bee]]s produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thom | date = 21 August 2007 | title = The Scent of the Waggle Dance | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e228 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228 | pmid=17713987 | pmc=1994260|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological relations===
[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]'')]]
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[heptacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

==Production==

===Petroleum refining===
[[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez, California]].]]
As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and [[crude oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Alkanes are separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products.

===Fischer–Tropsch===
The [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for [[petroleum distillate]]s.

===Laboratory preparation===
There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo [[functional group interconversion]]s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] as a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] gives the conjugate acid, ''n''-butane as a side-product:

: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; + [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]]

However, at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane-like functionality ([[alkyl]] group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an [[ethyl group]] is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group, it gives [[ethanol]], which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s:

:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{spaces|5}}(R = [[alkyl]])

Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey–House synthesis|Corey–House–Posner–Whitesides reaction]]. The [[Barton–McCombie deoxygenation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1-link=Derek Harold Richard Barton| last1=Barton |first1= D. H. R. |last2= McCombie |first2= S.

Synth.'' 1991, ''8'', 309–313, (Review).&lt;/ref&gt; removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl-substituted compounds e.g.:

==Applications==
The applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

[[Propane]] and [[butane]] are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf |title=Using propane as a fuel |access-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012000108/http://ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.

From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].

Some synthetic [[polymer]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.

{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
Alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds.  This inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment. Due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility, alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226738847|title=Microbial Degradation of Xenobiotics|pages=439–469|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23789-8_17|chapter=Microbial Degradation of Alkanes|year=2012|last1=Singh|first1=S.

Methane is flammable, explosive and dangerous to inhale, because it is a colorless, odorless gas, special caution must be taken around methane.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0291.html|title=CDC - METHANE - International Chemical Safety Cards - NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethane is also extremely flammable, dangerous to inhale and explosive.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0266.html|title=CDC - ETHANE - International Chemical Safety Cards - NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these may cause suffocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Similarly, propane is flammable and explosive.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0319.html|title=CDC - PROPANE - International Chemical Safety Cards - NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=19 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123021744/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0319.html|archive-date=23 November 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness if inhaled.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Butane has the same hazards to consider as propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0232.html|title=CDC - BUTANE - International Chemical Safety Cards - NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkanes also pose a threat to the environment. Branched alkanes have a lower biodegradability than unbranched alkanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SJP57-0UOzYC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=alkane+safety+as+hydrocarbon+chain+gets+longer#v=onepage&amp;q=alkane%20safety%20as%20hydrocarbon%20chain%20gets%20longer&amp;f=false|title=Environmental, Safety, and Health Engineering|last=Woodside|first=Gayle|last2=Kocurek|first2=Dianna|date=26 May 1997|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471109327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, methane is ranked as the most dangerous greenhouse gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.sepa.org.uk/spripa/Pages/SubstanceInformation.aspx?pid=65|title=Pollutant Fact Sheet|website=apps.sepa.org.uk|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is low, it does pose a threat to the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;
