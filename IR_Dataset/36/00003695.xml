'''Burundi''' is located in central [[Africa]], to the east of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], at the coordinates {{coord|3|30|S|30|0|E|}}.

==Physical geography==
[[Burundi]] occupies an area equal to {{convert|27830|km2}}  in size, of which {{convert|25680|km2}} is land.  The country has {{convert|1140|km}} of land border: {{convert|236|km}} of which is shared with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{convert|315|km}} with [[Rwanda]] and {{convert|589|km}} with [[Tanzania]].  As a landlocked country, Burundi possesses no coastline. It straddles the crest of the [[Congo-Nile Divide]] which separates the basins of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Nile]] rivers. The farthest headwaters of the Nile, the [[Ruvyironza River]], has its source in Burundi.

===Climate===
Burundi in general has a tropical highland climate, with a considerable daily temperature range in many areas. Temperature also varies considerably from one region to another, chiefly as a result of differences in altitude. The central plateau enjoys pleasantly cool weather, with an average temperature of {{convert|20|°C}}. The area around [[Lake Tanganyika]] is warmer, averaging {{convert|23|°C|1}}; the highest mountain areas are cooler, averaging {{convert|16|°C|1}}. [[Bujumbura]]’s average annual temperature is {{convert|23|°C|1}}. Rain is irregular, falling most heavily in the northwest. Dry seasons vary in length, and there are sometimes long periods of drought. However, four seasons can be distinguished: the long dry season (June–August), the short wet season (September–November), the short dry season (December–January), and the long wet season (February–May). Most of Burundi receives between {{convert|1300|and|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall a year. The [[Ruzizi Plain]] and the northeast receive between {{convert|750|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}

===Terrain===
[[File:Haut plateau.jpg|thumb|left|Plateau of Burundi]]
The terrain of Burundi is hilly and mountainous, dropping to a plateau in the east.  The southern and eastern [[plain]]s have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as part of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion.

The lowest point in the country is at [[Lake Tanganyika]], at {{convert|772|m}}, with the highest point being on [[Mount Heha]], at {{convert|2684|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/africa/burundi/land_and_resources.htm Burundi, land and resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Natural hazards are posed in Burundi by flooding and landslides.

===Natural resources===
Burundi possesses reserves of: [[nickel]], [[uranium]], rare earth oxides, [[peat]], [[cobalt]], copper, [[platinum]] (not yet exploited), [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], gold, [[tin]], [[tungsten]], [[kaolin]], and [[limestone]].  There is also arable land and the potential for hydropower.  Burundi has {{convert|214.3|km2}} of land that is irrigated.  The table below describes land use in Burundi.

==Environment==
===Current issues===
Soil erosion is an issue for Burundi, and is as a result of [[overgrazing]] and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands.  Other issues include: deforestation, due to the uncontrolled cutting-down of trees for fuel; and habitat loss threatens wildlife populations.

===International agreements===
Burundi is a party to the following international agreements that relate to the environment: Biodiversity, Climate Change, [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes and Ozone Layer Protection.  The following have been signed but not yet ratified by Burundi: Law of the Sea and Nuclear Test Ban.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Burundi]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.
