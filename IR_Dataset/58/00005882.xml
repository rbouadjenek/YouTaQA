'''Cardiff''' ({{lang-cy|Caerdydd}} {{IPA-cy|kairˈdiːð, kaːɨrˈdɨːð||Caerdydd.ogg}}) is the capital of [[Wales]] and its largest city. The eleventh-largest city in the [[United Kingdom]], it is Wales' chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural institutions and Welsh media, and the seat of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. At the 2011 census, the [[Local government in Wales|unitary authority area]] population was estimated to be 346,090,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and the wider urban area 479,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;statswales.gov.wales&quot; /&gt; Cardiff is a significant tourist centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 21.3&amp;nbsp;million visitors in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://businessnewswales.com/cardiff-boasts-record-visitor-numbers-during-2017/|title=Cardiff Boasts Record Visitor Numbers During 2017|date=26 March 2018|work=Business News Wales|access-date=7 July 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707203046/https://businessnewswales.com/cardiff-boasts-record-visitor-numbers-during-2017/|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Cardiff was ranked sixth in the world in [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']]'s alternative tourist destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13875925 |work=BBC News |title='Gem' Cardiff in world's top 10 places to visit in 2011 |date=22 June 2011 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917201359/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13875925 |archive-date=17 September 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff is the [[county town]] of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]], and in 1974, [[South Glamorgan]]. Cardiff is part of the [[Eurocities]] network of the largest European cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocities.org/ |title=Eurocities |accessdate=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110159/http://www.eurocities.org/main.php |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a [[port|major port]] for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city. In 1905, Cardiff was made a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and proclaimed the [[capital of Wales]] in 1955. At the 2011 Census the population was 346,090. The [[Cardiff Urban Area|Cardiff Built-up Area]] covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary and includes the towns of [[Dinas Powys]] and [[Penarth]].

Since the 1980s, Cardiff has seen significant development. A new waterfront area at [[Cardiff Bay]] contains the [[Senedd building|Senedd]] building, home to the Welsh Assembly and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the [[Cardiff International Sports Village]], the [[Roath Lock|BBC drama village]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposed BBC Drama Village at Media Capital, Roath Basin |url=http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en |publisher=Welsh Assembly Government |accessdate=6 April 2011 |date=14 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315165706/http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a new business district in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff Business District 'needs skills and transport' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961 |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=6 April 2011 |date=30 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402184433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961 |archive-date=2 April 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sporting venues in the city include the [[Millennium Stadium|Principality Stadium]]{{mdash}}the national stadium and the home of the [[Wales national rugby union team]]{{mdash}}[[Sophia Gardens (cricket ground)|Sophia Gardens]] (the home of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]]), [[Cardiff City Stadium]] (the home of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City football team]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales football team]]), [[Cardiff International Sports Stadium]] (the home of [[Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club]]), [[Cardiff Arms Park]] (the home of [[Cardiff Blues]] and [[Cardiff RFC]] rugby union teams) and [[Ice Arena Wales]] (the home of [[Cardiff Devils]] ice hockey team). The city hosted the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. Cardiff was awarded [[European City of Sport]] due to its role in hosting major international sporting events in 2009 and again in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City takes European sports capital title for 2014 |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2011/04/01/city-takes-european-sports-capital-title-for-2014-91466-28440348/ |accessdate=6 April 2011 |newspaper=South Wales Echo |date=1 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123142245/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2011/04/01/city-takes-european-sports-capital-title-for-2014-91466-28440348/ |archive-date=23 January 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principality Stadium hosted 11 football matches as part of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], including the games' opening event and the men's bronze medal match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic football in Cardiff |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961 |publisher=Visit Cardiff |accessdate=6 April 2011 |date=22 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402184433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961 |archive-date=2 April 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{lang|cy|Caerdydd}} (the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the city) derives from the earlier Welsh form {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}. The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|ð|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning &quot;the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]&quot;. The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.&lt;ref name=hwo&gt;Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. University of Wales Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84323-901-9}}, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anglicisation|anglicised]] ''Cardiff'' is derived from {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}, with the Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} borrowed as ''ff'' {{IPAc-en|f|}}, as also happens in ''Taff'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Taf}}) and ''[[Llandaff]]'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Llandaf}}).

The antiquarian [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from *{{lang|wlm|Caer-Didi}} (&quot;the Fort of Didius&quot;), a name supposedly given in honour of {{lang|la|[[Aulus Didius Gallus]]|italic=no}}, governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established. Although some sources repeat this theory, it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor {{lang|cy|Gwynedd|italic=no}} Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |title=What's In A Name? – Cardiff |last=Pierce |first=Gwynedd O |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=17 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |archivedate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence from sites in and around Cardiff: the [[St Lythans burial chamber]] near [[Wenvoe]], (approximately {{convert|4|mi}} to the west of Cardiff city centre); the [[Tinkinswood|Tinkinswood burial chamber]], near [[St Nicholas]] (about {{convert|6|mi}} west of Cardiff city centre), the Cae'rarfau [[Chambered tomb|Chambered Tomb]], [[Creigiau]] (about {{convert|6|mi|}} northwest of Cardiff city centre) and the Gwern y Cleppa Long Barrow, near [[Coedkernew]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] (about {{convert|8|mi}} northeast of Cardiff city centre), all show that people had settled in the area by at least around 6000&amp;nbsp;BC, during the early Neolithic;

Until the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], Cardiff was part of the territory of the [[Silures]] – a [[Iron Age tribes in Britain|Celtic British tribe]] that flourished in the [[Iron Age]] – whose territory included the areas that would become known as [[Breconshire]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and Glamorgan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wales Hist 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=John |authorlink=John Davies (historian) |title=A History of Wales |publisher=Penguin |year=1994 |location=London |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|3.2|ha|acre|0|adj=on}} [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] established by the [[Roman army|Romans]] near the mouth of the River Taff in AD&amp;nbsp;75, in what would become the north western boundary of the centre of Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement that had been established by the Romans in the 50s&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coflein 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=CARDIFF ROMAN SETTLEMENT – Site details – coflein |url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/301346/details/CARDIFF+ROMAN+SETTLEMENT/ |accessdate=10 June 2009 |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales |date=30 August 2007 |work=RCAHMW website |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61D4rmoUD?url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/301346/details/CARDIFF+ROMAN+SETTLEMENT/ |archive-date=25 August 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was one of a series of military outposts associated with ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]]) that acted as border defences.

Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. The settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]] emerged as the local king in [[Glywysing]] (which later became [[Glamorgan]]). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rees |first=William |title=Cardiff: A History of the City |publisher=The Corporation of the City of Cardiff |year=1969 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute]] was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called &quot;the creator of modern Cardiff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cardiffians&quot;/&gt; A twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and [[Bristol]] was established in 1815,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Sanders 2&quot;/&gt; and in 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Sanders 2&quot;/&gt;

After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of [[Dic Penderyn]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brief History of Wales|last=Morgan|first=Gerald|publisher=Y Lolfa|year=2011|isbn=1847710182|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]] built a [[dock (maritime)|dock]], which eventually linked to the [[Taff Vale Railway]]. Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the [[Cynon Valley|Cynon]], [[Rhondda]], and [[Rhymney Valley|Rhymney]] valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to [[human migration|migration]] from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Leary |first=Paul |title=Irish Migrants in Modern Wales |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2004 |page=14 |isbn=978-0-85323-858-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qkCmYNMVMxwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1 |accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Francis Michael Longstreth |title=The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=311 |isbn=978-0-521-43816-2 |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eozO2RzSAVUC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the [[University of Wales|University College South Wales and Monmouthshire]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt;

Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies of Llandinam]] and the [[Barry Railway Company]] promoted the development of rival docks at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]. Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all [[tide]]s, and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause &quot;grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff&quot;. From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its [[Coal Exchange]], where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt; The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of the owners of the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in Merthyr (who would later form part of [[GKN|Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]]) to build a new [[steel mill|steelworks]] close to the docks at East Moors, which Lord Bute opened on 4 February 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&amp;coll_id=77663&amp;expand= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104023150/http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&amp;coll_id=77663&amp;expand= |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 January 2009 |title=East Moors Steelworks, Cardiff collection (record of information achival) |date=1 February 2006 |publisher=Glamorgan Records Office |accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] on 28 October 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckett |first=J.V. |title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd |year=2005 |page=2 |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;lpg=PP1 |accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city acquired a Roman Catholic cathedral in 1916. Later, more national institutions came to the city, including the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]], the [[Welsh National War Memorial]], and the [[University of Wales]] Registry Building. But it was denied the [[National Library of Wales]], partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have &quot;a non-Welsh population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt;

After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the [[interwar period]]. By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for [[South Wales coalfield|Welsh coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt; Bomb damage during the [[Cardiff Blitz]] in World War II included the devastation of [[Llandaff Cathedral]], and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.

The city was recognised as the [[Capital of Wales|capital city of Wales]] on 20 December 1955, in a written reply by the [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1955/dec/20/capital-of-principality-cardiff|title=Capital of Principality (Cardiff) (Hansard, 20 December 1955)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=30 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830234559/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1955/dec/20/capital-of-principality-cardiff|archive-date=30 August 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caernarfon]] had also vied for this title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff as Capital of Wales: Formal Recognition by Government |newspaper=The Times |date=21 December 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh local authorities had been divided about the location of a new capital of Wales: only 76 out of 161 chose Cardiff in a 1924 poll organised by the ''South Wales Daily News''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnes 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prof. Martin Johnes |url=https://www.academia.edu/716868/Cardiff_The_Making_and_Development_of_the_Capital_City_of_Wales |title=Cardiff: The Making and Development of the Capital City of Wales |publisher=Contemporary British History |year=2012 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=509–28 |website=Academia.edu |access-date=11 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511111542/https://www.academia.edu/716868/Cardiff_The_Making_and_Development_of_the_Capital_City_of_Wales |archive-date=11 May 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the divided opinions, the subject was not debated again until 1950, and Cardiff took steps to promote its &quot;Welshness&quot;. The stalemate between Cardiff and cities such as Caernarfon and Aberystwyth was not broken until Cardiganshire County Council decided to support Cardiff; and in a new local authority vote, 134 out of 161 voted for Cardiff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnes 2012&quot; /&gt;

Cardiff therefore celebrated two important [[anniversary|anniversaries]] in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales &quot;had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have&quot;. Although the city hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the [[Arts Council of Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]], most of which were based in Cardiff.

The National Assembly for Wales has been based in Cardiff Bay since its formation in 1999. The building, known as the ''Senedd'' (which translates into English as Legislature, Parliament or Senate) was opened on 1 March 2006 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid=16757822&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082&amp;headline=queen-to-open-wales--senedd-name_page.html |title=Queen to open Wales' Senedd |date=1 March 2006 |publisher=WalesOnline.co.uk |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/683gTl7My?url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid%3D16757822%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50082%26headline%3Dqueen-to-open-wales--senedd-name_page.html |archive-date=31 May 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|Assembly Members (AMs)]], the Assembly Commission and ministerial support staff are based in Cardiff Bay. Cardiff elects four constituency Assembly Members (AMs) to the Assembly; the constituencies for the Assembly are the same as for the UK Parliament. All of the city's electors have an extra vote for the [[South Wales Central]] regional members; this system increases proportionality to the Assembly. The most recent Welsh Assembly general election was held on [[2016 National Assembly for Wales election|5 May 2016]].

[[File:Cardiff 13741 Crown Buildings 01.JPG|thumb|Crown Buildings are the Welsh Government's main offices in Cardiff]]

In the Assembly Cardiff is represented by Jenny Rathbone (Labour) in [[Cardiff Central (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff Central]], [[Julie Morgan]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff North (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff North]], [[Vaughan Gething]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff South and Penarth (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff South and Penarth]] and [[Mark Drakeford]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff West (Assembly constituency)|Cardiff West]].

In Westminster, Cardiff is represented by Jo Stevens (Labour) in [[Cardiff Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff Central]], [[Anna McMorrin]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]], [[Stephen Doughty]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff South and Penarth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff South and Penarth]] and [[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff West (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff West]].

=== Local government ===
Between 1889 and 1974 Cardiff was a county borough governed by [[Cardiff County Borough Council]] (known as Cardiff City Council after 1905). Between 1974 and 1996, Cardiff was governed by [[Cardiff City Council]], a district council of [[South Glamorgan]]. Since [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994|local government reorganisation in 1996]], Cardiff has been governed by the City and County Council of Cardiff, which is based at [[County Hall, Cardiff|County Hall]] in Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff Bay. Voters elect 75 councillors every four years.

Between the 2004 and 2012 local elections, no individual political party held a majority on Cardiff County Council. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] held the largest number of seats and Cllr [[Rodney Berman]] was Leader of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2872%2C4274%2C4956&amp;parent_directory_id=2865 |title=Council Composition |date=14 May 2008 |publisher=Cardiff County Council |accessdate=22 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927042410/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?Parent_Directory_id=2865&amp;nav=2872%2C4274%2C4956 |archivedate=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru formed a partnership administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics-news/2008/05/13/lib-dems-and-plaid-set-for-a-coalition-in-cardiff-91466-20899896/ |title=Lib Dems and Plaid set for a coalition in Cardiff |last=Shipton |first=Martin |date=13 May 2008 |publisher=WalesOnline |accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2012 Cardiff Council election|2012 elections]] the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] achieved an outright majority, after gaining an additional 33 seats across the city.

[[File:Cardiff UK community councils.svg|thumb|Communities of Cardiff that have their own community council]]
Cardiff is divided into communities. Several of these have their own community council, while the rest are governed solely by Cardiff City Council. Those with community councils are:
* Lisvane
* Old St Mellons
* Pentyrch 
* Radyr and Morganstown 
* St Fagans
* Tongwynlais

[[File:View over Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|Looking south towards [[Cardiff city centre]]]]
{{main|Geography of Cardiff}}
The centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and is bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west. Its location influenced its development as the world's largest coal port, most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the [[South Wales Valleys]]. The highest point in the local authority area is [[Garth Hill]], {{convert|307|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of [[Triassic]] stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from [[Chepstow]] to the [[Ely Estuary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004 |title=Cardiff Supplementary Planning Guidance: Archaeologically Sensitive Areas |date=20 July 2006 |publisher=Cardiff County Council |accessdate=1 October 2008 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609181416/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004 |archivedate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes of this part of the world are usually shallow and low-lying, consistent with the flatness of the centre of Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Discussion on palaeoecology of the Late Triassic extinction event in the SW UK |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |publisher=Geological Society of London |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=988–992 |url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/full/165/5/988 |accessdate=1 October 2008 |doi=10.1144/0016-76492008-014 |last1=Radley |first1=J.

Many of these Triassic rocks are purplish, especially the coastal marl found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is &quot;Radyr Stone&quot;, a [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] which as its name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |title=Triassic building sandstone resources |accessdate=7 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610061832/http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |archive-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: [[Devonian]] sandstones (the [[Old Red Sandstone]]) from the [[Brecon Beacons]] has been used. Most famously, the buildings of [[Cathays Park]], the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of [[Portland stone]] from Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf |format=PDF |title=Geological Walks in Wales: Cathays Park |publisher=Geologists Association South Wales |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202443/http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the yellow-grey [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] [[limestone]] rock of the Vale of Glamorgan, including the very rare &quot;Sutton Stone&quot;, a conglomerate of lias limestone and [[carboniferous]] limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/morgraig.html |title=Castell Morgraig |last=Iowerth |first=Dylan |journal=Castle Studies Group Newsletter |year=1998 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907230838/http://castlewales.com/morgraig.html |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the Vale of Glamorgan, also known as The Garden of Cardiff;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ |title=The Garden of Cardiff |accessdate=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509082545/http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the east by the city of Newport; to the north by the [[South Wales Valleys]]; and to the south by the [[River Severn|Severn Estuary]] and [[Bristol Channel]]. The River Taff winds through the centre of the city and together with the [[River Ely]] flows into the freshwater lake of Cardiff Bay. A third river, the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney]], flows through the east of the city directly into the Severn Estuary.

Cardiff is situated near the [[Glamorgan]] [[Heritage Coast]], stretching westward from Penarth and Barry – [[commuter town]]s of Cardiff – with striped yellow-blue [[Jurassic]] limestone cliffs. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the [[Celtic Sea]] that has exposed Jurassic ([[blue lias]]) geology. This stretch of coast, which has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs, was a [[ship graveyard]]; many ships sailing to Cardiff during the industrial era were wrecked around this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales. Smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html |title=Smuggling Around Kenfig |publisher=Kenfig.org |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181813/http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html |archive-date=22 April 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh was the majority language in Cardiff from the 13th century until the city's explosive growth in the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;welsh&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Geraint H. |title=The Welsh Language before the Industrial Revolution |location=Cardiff |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-7083-1418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1850, five of the 12 [[Anglican]] churches within the current city boundaries conducted their services exclusively in the [[Welsh language]], while only two worshipped exclusively in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;welsh&quot;/&gt; By 1891, the percentage of Welsh speakers had dropped to 27.9% and only [[Lisvane]], [[Llanedeyrn]] and [[Creigiau]] remained as majority Welsh-speaking communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language and Community in the Nineteenth Century |first=Geraint H. |last=Jenkins |isbn=0-7083-1467-8 |year=1998 |publisher=Univ. of Wales Press |location=Cardiff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh language became grouped around a small cluster of chapels and churches, the most notable of which is Tabernacl in the city centre, one of four UK churches chosen to hold official services to commemorate the new millennium.

The city's first Welsh-language school (Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf) was established in the 1950s, and Welsh has since regained ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2755217.stm |title=Census shows Welsh language rise |date=14 February 2003 |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406154822/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2755217.stm |archive-date=6 April 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by [[Welsh-medium education]] and migration from other parts of Wales, there are now many more Welsh speakers: their numbers doubled between the 1991 and 2011 censuses, from 18,071 (6.6%) to 36,735 (11.1%) residents aged three years and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/Your-Council/Strategies-plans-and-policies/Bilingual-Cardiff/Pages/default.aspx|title=Bilingual Cardiff   – Cardiff.gov.uk|website=cardiff.gov.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=13 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721100811/https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/Your-Council/Strategies-plans-and-policies/Bilingual-Cardiff/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=21 July 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LSOA]] (Lower Layer Super Output Area) with the highest percentage of Welsh speakers in the city centre is found in [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]], at 25.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statiaith.com/blog/cyfrifiad-2011/mapiau-am-y-gymraeg-o-gyfrifiad-2011/|title=Mapiau Cyfrifiad 2011 {{!}} Statiaith|website=statiaith.com|access-date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215142240/http://statiaith.com/blog/cyfrifiad-2011/mapiau-am-y-gymraeg-o-gyfrifiad-2011/|archive-date=15 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSOA with the highest percentage of Welsh speakers in the whole of Cardiff is [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]], at 26%.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;

In addition to English and Welsh, the diversity of Cardiff's population (including foreign students) means that many other languages are spoken in the city. One study has found that Cardiff has speakers of at least 94 languages, with [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] being the most commonly-spoken foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/pdf/pubs/positively_plurilingual.pdf |title=Positively Plurilingual |format=PDF |accessdate=3 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128094815/http://www.cilt.org.uk/pdf/pubs/positively_plurilingual.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1922, Cardiff has included [[Llandaff]] within its boundary, and therefore [[Llandaff Cathedral]], an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral, the parish church of Llandaff and the seat of the [[Bishop of Llandaff]], the head of the [[Church in Wales]] [[Diocese of Llandaff]].

There is a Roman Catholic [[Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral|cathedral]] in the city. Since 1916, Cardiff has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated Catholic population, with estimated numbers in 2006 being around 25,000 fewer than in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html#stats |title=Archdiocese of Cardiff – Statistics |accessdate=18 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517123138/http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html#stats |archive-date=17 May 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Jewish population of the city also appears to have fallen – there are two synagogues in Cardiff, one in Cyncoed and one in Moira Terrace, as opposed to seven at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/Cardiff.htm |title=JCR-UK – Cardiff Community |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512081945/http://www.jewishgen.org/JCR-UK/Community/Cardiff.htm |archive-date=12 May 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a significant number of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] chapels, an early 20th century Greek Orthodox church and 11 mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Roath/Chapels.html |title=Cardiff, Llandaff &amp; Roath chapels database |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119180148/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Roath/Chapels.html |archive-date=19 January 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nostos.com/church/ |title=The Greek Orthodox Church in Great Britain |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122154842/http://www.nostos.com/church/ |archive-date=22 January 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimdirectory.co.uk/displayresults.php?PHPSESSID=f0fb8b41d8758983e7d43cddb556b9df&amp;businesstype=1&amp;orgtype=&amp;country=UK&amp;city=Cardiff |title=Muslim Directory – Mosques in Cardiff |accessdate=23 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.muslimdirectory.co.uk/displayresults.php?PHPSESSID=f0fb8b41d8758983e7d43cddb556b9df&amp;businesstype=1&amp;orgtype=&amp;country=UK&amp;city=Cardiff |archivedate=2 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 census 66.9% of Cardiff's population described itself as Christian, a percentage point below the Welsh and UK averages.

The oldest of the non-Christian communities in Wales is Judaism. Jews were not permitted to live in England and Wales between the 1290 [[Edict of Expulsion]] – given by [[Edward I of England]] – and the 17th century. A Welsh Jewish community was re-established in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/religion/sites/timeline/pages/religion_in_wales_15.shtml |title=Multicultural Wales |accessdate=6 December 2007 |publisher=British Broadcasting Company |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430180121/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/religion/sites/timeline/pages/religion_in_wales_15.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was once a fairly substantial Jewish population in South Wales, most of which has disappeared.

In the 2001 census Cardiff's Muslim population stood at 3.7%, above the [[Islam in the UK|UK average (2.7%)]] and significantly above the [[Islam in Wales|Welsh average]].

The proportion of Cardiff residents declaring themselves to be Hindu, Sikh and Jewish were all considerably higher than the Welsh averages, but less than the UK figures. The city has been home to a sizable Hindu community since Indian immigrants settled there during the 1950s and 1960s.

As the capital city of Wales, Cardiff is the main engine of growth in the Welsh economy. Though the population of Cardiff is about 10% of the Welsh population, the economy of Cardiff makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city's workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding south Wales area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_&amp;_Local_Area_GDP.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924210535/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_%26_Local_Area_GDP.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2009 |url-status=dead |title=Sub-regional and local area gross domestic product |last=Clifton-Fearnside |first=Alex |author2=Adam Douglas |date=14 May 2002 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=18 April 2008 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&amp;IF_Language=isl |title=Statistics on Commuting in Wales |date=5 December 2007 |publisher=Statistics for Wales |accessdate=18 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114021425/http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&amp;IF_Language=isl |archive-date=14 January 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by [[packhorse]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This was first achieved by the construction of a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.&lt;ref name=&quot;canal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm |title=The Glamorganshire Canal |accessdate=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227160758/http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm |archivedate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the [[Taff Vale Railway]] replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.

'''029''' is the current telephone dialling code for Cardiff, as well as for the neighbouring towns of Penarth, Dinas Powys and [[Caerphilly]]. The dialling code is optional when dialling within the area: one can dial between any two phones within the 029 code using only the eight-digit local number.

Prior to the [[Big Number Change]] on 22 April 2000 the area had shorter, six-digit local numbers with an area code of 01222 (0222 before May 1995). There remains a common misconception that local numbers are still six digits long and that the code is 02920, even though there are newer Cardiff numbers in the ranges (029) 21xx xxxx and (029) 22xx xxxx.

== Landmarks and attractions ==
{{See also|Architecture of Cardiff|Listed buildings in Cardiff}}
[[File:Adeilad y Pierhead, Caerdydd.jpg|thumb|[[Pierhead Building]]]]
Cardiff has many landmark buildings such as the Principality Stadium, [[Pierhead Building]] the Welsh National Museum and the Senedd, the home of the National Assembly for Wales. Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].

[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller, memorials.

In addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.

Cardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides – Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two Motte and Bailey castles in Radyr and Rhiwbina (both known as the &quot;Twmpath&quot;, a Welsh word for a small mound),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as Castell Morgraig. Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of these castles is indicative of the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.

While not strictly castles in the historic sense, there is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], a fortified residence belonging to the Bishops of Llandaff and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]], a preserved seventeenth century manor house, once the seat of the Earls of Plymouth.

Other major tourist attractions are the [[Cardiff Bay]] regeneration sites which include the recently opened Wales Millennium Centre and the Senedd, and many other cultural and sites of interest including the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]] and the famous [[Coal Exchange]]. The [[New Theatre (Cardiff)|New Theatre]] was founded in 1906 and completely refurbished in the 1980s. Until the opening of the Wales Millennium Centre in 2004, it was the premier venue in Wales for touring theatre and dance companies. Other venues which are popular for concerts and sporting events include [[Motorpoint Arena Cardiff|Motorpoint Arena]], St David's Hall and the Principality Stadium. [[Cardiff Story]], a museum documenting the city's history, has been open to the public since spring 2011.

Cardiff has over 1,000 listed buildings, ranging from the more prominent buildings such as the castles, to smaller buildings, houses and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?Parent_Directory_id=2865&amp;nav=2870,3139,3939,3972 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927041924/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?Parent_Directory_id=2865&amp;nav=2870%2C3139%2C3939%2C3972 |archivedate=27 September 2006 |title=Listed and Locally Listed Buildings |publisher=Cardiff County Council |accessdate=28 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathedral Road was developed by the 3rd Marquis of Bute and is lined by fine villas, some backing on to Sophia Gardens.

Cardiff has walks of special interest for tourists and [[Walking|ramblers]] alike, such as the [[Cardiff Centenary Walk|Centenary Walk]], which runs for {{convert|2.3|mi|km|1}} within Cardiff city centre. This route passes through many of Cardiff's landmarks and historic buildings. The [[Animal Wall]], designed by [[William Burges]] in 1866, marks the south edge of Bute Park on Castle Street. It bears 15 carved animal statues.

{{main|Music of Cardiff}}
[[File:Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|[[Motorpoint Arena Cardiff]]]]
A large number of concerts are held within the city, the larger ones being performed in St David's Hall, the [[Motorpoint Arena Cardiff|Motorpoint Arena]] (previously known as the Cardiff International Arena) and occasionally the Principality Stadium.

Cardiff hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1883, 1899, 1938, 1960, 1978, 2008 and 2018. Cardiff is unique in Wales in having two permanent [[stone circles]] used by the Gorsedd of [[Bard]]s during Eisteddfodau. The original circle stands in Gorsedd Gardens in front of the [[National Museum]] while its 1978 replacement is situated in [[Bute Park]]. Since 1983, Cardiff has hosted the [[BBC Cardiff Singer of the World]] competition, a world-renowned event on the opera calendar which is held every two years. The city also hosts smaller events.

[[File:St Davids Hall Interior.jpg|thumb|[[St David's Hall]]]]
