During ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'', Lister visits the set of ''Coronation Street'', where he meets the actor Craig Charles.&lt;ref&gt;''Blokely'', 7 November 2012, James York &amp; Richard Luck [http://blokely.com/entertainment/craig-charles-interview-red-dwarf-x &quot; Craig Charles: Funk &amp; Soul x Sci-fi&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Robot Wars'' ===
Charles presented ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' on BBC2 (1998–2003) and Channel 5 (2003–04), from series 2 until series 7, which included two ''Extreme'' series and numerous 'specials'. Charles was the main host and presided over the arena in which teams of amateur engineers battled their home-made radio-controlled robots against each other, and against the house robots. Charles introduced the show, enthusiastically announced the results of the battles and spoke to the contestants after the main events. He ended each episode with a short ''Robot Wars''-themed poem. Charles' son, Jack, appeared on the show on several occasions, and was a contestant on &quot;Team Nemesis&quot; during series 4. Charles also hosted the ''Robot Wars Live'' UK tour, in 2001 and shows performed at the [[Wembley Arena]].

On 13 January 2016, the BBC announced that the show would be rebooted with 6 episodes in the year. On 14 January 2016, Charles posted a tweet on his Twitter page saying that he would love to present the new series, however he received no reply from the BBC. On 3 February 2016, [[Dara Ó Briain]] was announced as Charles' replacement as the presenter. The BBC also stated that they had denied Charles' request to reprise his role by stating that they don't comment on individual casting enquiries.

=== ''Takeshi's Castle'' ===
Charles provided the English [[voice-over]] commentary for the [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]] (2002–04) rebroadcast of the popular game show ''[[Takeshi's Castle#United Kingdom|Takeshi's Castle]]'', originally by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] in Japan. In each episode, between 100 and 142 contestants attempted to pass a series of wacky and near-impossible physical challenges to reach the Show Down at the castle against a Japanese actor [[Takeshi Kitano]] for a chance to win large cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the programme and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and also some special and &quot;best of&quot; episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers - and also coined the term &quot;Keshi Heads&quot; to describe fans of the show.

Charles' commentary was so well received that the 2013 reboot featuring [[Dick and Dom]] on the voice-overs did not fare as well because he wasn't there, according to complaints that Challenge received via social media. To this day, the Challenge rebroadcasts of ''Takeshi's Castle'' regularly place in the weekly top 10 for ratings with an average of 130,000 viewers per episode.

In July 1994, Charles and a friend were arrested and [[Remand (detention)|remanded]] in custody for three months on a rape charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/profile-craig-charles-the-inside-story-1281538.html |title=Profile: Craig Charles: The Inside Story |last=Rampton |first=James |date=4 January 1997 |work=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1995, both men were acquitted in their trial. After being cleared, Charles spoke of the need to restore anonymity for those accused of rape. He stated that &quot;the fact that my name and address along with my picture can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called 'victim' has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape defendants is a must and that the law must be changed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;indep&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/red-dwarf-star-cleared-of-rape-7946138.html |title='Red Dwarf' star cleared of rape |last=Cusick |first=James |date=4 March 1995 |website=Independent.co.uk |access-date=10 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Craig Charles cleared of rape |date=3 March 1995 |work=News at Ten}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison, Charles was attacked by a man wielding a makeshift knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3055859.stm |title=The trauma of being falsely accused |date=31 July 2003 |work=BBC News |access-date=27 December 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug use ===
In June 2006, newspaper allegations of [[crack cocaine]] use resulted in Charles being suspended from both ''Coronation Street''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5391724.stm |title=Charles to make Street comeback |date=29 September 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=27 December 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BBC Radio 6 Music.
