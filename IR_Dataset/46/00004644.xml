'''Balmoral Castle''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|l|ˈ|m|ɒr|əl}}) is a large [[estate house]] in [[Royal Deeside]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, owned by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. It is near the village of [[Crathie]], {{convert|6.2|mi|0}} west of [[Ballater]] and {{convert|6.8|mi|0}} east of [[Braemar]].

Balmoral has been one of the [[List of British royal residences|residences]] of the [[British royal family]] since 1852, when the estate and its original castle were bought by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]]. 
Soon after the estate was purchased by the royal family, the existing house was found to be too small and the current Balmoral Castle was commissioned. The architect was [[William Smith (architect)|William Smith]] of Aberdeen, although his designs were amended by Prince Albert. Balmoral remains private property of the Queen and is not part of the [[Crown Estate]].

The castle is an example of [[Scottish baronial architecture]], and is classified by [[Historic Environment Scotland]] as a [[category A listed]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB51460 |desc=BALMORAL CASTLE WITH PARTERRE AND TERRACE WALLS |cat=A |access-date=6 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new castle was completed in 1856 and the old castle demolished shortly thereafter.

The Balmoral [[Estate (land)|Estate]] has been added to by successive members of the royal family, and now covers an area of approximately {{convert|50,000|acre|ha}}. It is a working estate, including [[Red Grouse|grouse moors]], forestry, and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer, [[Highland cattle]], and ponies.

==History==

[[File:Robert Gordon Litho.jpg|thumb|After 1830, [[Robert Gordon (diplomat)|Sir Robert Gordon]] made major alterations to the original castle - ''lithograph by Josef Kriehuber, 1846'']]

[[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] of Scotland (1316–1390) had a [[hunting|hunting lodge]] in the area. Historical records also indicate that a house at Balmoral was built by Sir William Drummond in 1390.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whichcastle.com/aberdeenshire/balmoralcastle.htm |title=Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire |publisher=www.whichcastle.com |date= |accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate is recorded in 1451 as &quot;Bouchmorale&quot;, and later was tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the [[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly|1st Earl of Huntly]]. A [[tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]] was built on the estate by the Gordons.&lt;ref name=garden&gt;{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=GDL00045 |desc=BALMORAL CASTLE |access-date=6 March 2019|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1662, the estate passed to Charles Farquharson of [[Inverey]], brother of [[John Farquharson, 3rd of Inverey|John Farquharson]], the &quot;Black Colonel&quot;. The Farquharsons were [[jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathisers, and James Farquharson of Balmoral was involved in both the 1715 and 1745 [[Jacobite risings|rebellions]]. He was wounded at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)|Battle of Falkirk]] in 1746. The Farquharson estates were [[wikt:forfeit|forfeit]], and passed to the Farquharsons of [[Braemar|Auchendryne]].&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Seton Gordon|Gordon, Seton]] |title=Seton Gordon's Cairngorms : an anthology |publisher=Whittles |year=2009 |chapter=The Country of Balmoral |pages=141–142 |isbn=978-1-904445-88-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, [[James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife]], acquired Balmoral and leased the castle. [[Robert Gordon (diplomat)|Sir Robert Gordon]], a younger brother of the [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|4th Earl of Aberdeen]], acquired the lease in 1830. He made major alterations to the original castle at Balmoral, including baronial-style extensions that were designed by [[John Smith (architect)|John Smith]] of Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;

===Royal acquisition===

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland in 1842, five years after her accession to the throne and two years after their marriage. During this first visit they stayed at [[Edinburgh]], and at [[Taymouth Castle]] in [[Perthshire]], the home of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane|Marquess of Breadalbane]].&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; They returned in 1844 to stay at [[Blair Castle]] and, in 1847, when they rented Ardverikie by [[Loch Laggan]].&lt;ref&gt;Millar, pp.23,31&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter trip they encountered weather that was extremely rainy, which led [[James Clark (physician)|Sir James Clark]], the queen's doctor, to recommend [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Deeside]] instead, for its more healthy climate.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Robert Gordon died in 1847 and his lease on Balmoral reverted to Lord Aberdeen. In February 1848 an arrangement was made—that Prince Albert would acquire the remaining part of the lease on Balmoral, together with its furniture and staff—without having seen the property first.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|5}}

[[File:Dronning_victoria.jpg|thumb|Detail of state portrait of Victoria by [[George Hayter]], 1837]]

The royal couple arrived for their first visit on 8 September 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, pp.40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria found the house &quot;small but pretty&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in her diary that: &quot;All seemed to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils&quot;.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; The surrounding hilly landscape reminded them of [[Thuringia]], Albert's homeland in Germany.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Quickly, the house was confirmed to be too small and, in 1848, John and William Smith were commissioned to design new offices, cottages, and other ancillary buildings.&lt;ref name=millar55/&gt; Improvements to the woodlands, gardens, and estate buildings also were being made, with the assistance of the landscape gardener, James Beattie, and possibly by the painter, [[james Giles (painter)|James Giles]].&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;

Major additions to the old house were considered in 1849,&lt;ref name=millar55&gt;Millar, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; but by then negotiations were under way to purchase the estate from the trustees of the deceased Earl Fife. After seeing a [[corrugated iron]] cottage at the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], Prince Albert ordered a pre-fabricated iron building for Balmoral from E. T. Bellhouse &amp; Co., to serve as a temporary ballroom and dining room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/bellhouse/chapter4.pdf |title=E.T. Bellhouse and Co. Engineers and Iron Founders |work=David Bellhouse and Sons, Manchester |author=Bellhouse, David |year=2000 |accessdate=23 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615114839/http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/bellhouse/chapter4.pdf |archive-date=15 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in use by 1 October 1851, and would serve as a ballroom until 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar, p.59&quot;&gt;Millar, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale was completed in June 1852, the price being £32,000, and Prince Albert formally took possession that autumn.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name=millar56&gt;Millar, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring estate of [[Birkhall]] was bought at the same time, and the lease on [[Abergeldie Castle]] secured as well. To mark the occasion, the ''[[Balmoral cairns|Purchase Cairn]]'' was erected in the hills overlooking the castle, the first of many.

===Construction of the new house===

[[File:Balmoral Castle - Project Gutenberg 13103.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.15|''Balmoral Castle'' - a principal [[keep]] similar to that of [[Craigievar Castle]] is the central feature of the castle, while a large [[turret]]ed [[Scottish estate houses|country house]] is attached]]

The growing family of Victoria and Albert, the need for additional staff, and the quarters required for visiting friends and official visitors such as cabinet members, however, meant that extension of the existing structure would not be sufficient and that a larger house needed to be built. In early 1852, this was commissioned from William Smith.&lt;ref name=millar56/&gt; The son of John Smith (who designed the 1830 alterations of the original castle), William Smith was city architect of [[Aberdeen]] from 1852. On learning of the commission, [[William Burn]] sought an interview with the prince, apparently to complain that Smith previously had plagiarised his work, however, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201859 |title=William Smith II |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects 1840–1980 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Smith's designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:balmoral by queen.JPG|thumb|right|''Balmoral Castle'', painted by Queen Victoria in 1854 during its construction]]

Construction began during summer 1853, on a site some {{convert|100|yd}} northwest of the original building that was considered to have a better vista.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, pp.56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for consideration was, that whilst construction was ongoing, the family would still be able to use the old house.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|9}} Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 28 September 1853, during her annual autumn visit.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; By the autumn of 1855, the royal apartments were ready for occupancy, although the tower was still under construction and the servants had to be lodged in the old house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar, p.59&quot;/&gt; By coincidence, shortly after their arrival at the estate that autumn, news circulated about the fall of [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Sevastopol]], ending the Crimean War, resulting in wild celebrations by royalty and locals alike. While visiting the estate shortly thereafter, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick of Prussia]] asked for the hand of [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]].&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|11}}

The new house was completed in 1856, and the old castle subsequently was demolished.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; By autumn 1857, a new bridge across the Dee, designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] linking Crathie and Balmoral was finished.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Balmoral Castle is built from [[granite]] quarried at Invergelder on the estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scotland's Gardens |author=Little, G. A. |publisher=Spur Books |year=1981 |isbn=0-7157-2091-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/scotlandsgardens00litt }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two main blocks, each arranged around a courtyard. The southwestern block contains the main rooms, while the northeastern contains the service wings. At the southeast is an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} tall clock tower topped with turrets,&lt;ref name=glendinning/&gt; one of which has a balustrade similar to a feature at [[Castle Fraser]].&lt;ref name=fenwick&gt;{{cite book |author=Fenwick, Hubert |title=Scotland's Historic Buildings |isbn=0-7091-4497-0 |publisher=Robert Hale |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being similar in style to the demolished castle of the 1830s, the architecture of the new house is considered to be somewhat dated for its time when contrasted with the richer forms of [[Scots Baronial]] being developed by William Burn and others during the 1850s.&lt;ref name=glendinning&gt;{{cite book |author=Glendinning, Miles |author2=MacKechnie, Aonghus |author3=MacInnes, Ranald |title=A History of Scottish Architecture |page=270 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=0-7486-0849-4 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an exercise in Scots Baronial, it sometimes is described as being too ordered, pedantic, and even [[Architecture of Germany|Germanic]] as a consequence of Prince Albert's influence on the design.&lt;ref name=fenwick/&gt;

However, the purchase of a Scottish estate by Victoria and Albert and their adoption of a Scottish architectural style, was influential for the ongoing revival of [[Highland culture]]. They decorated Balmoral with tartans and attended [[highland games]] at Braemar. Queen Victoria expressed an affinity for Scotland, even professing herself to be a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Devine, T.M. |title=The Scottish Nation 1700–2000 |publisher=Penguin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-14-102769-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the work of [[Sir Walter Scott]], this became a major factor in promoting the adoption of [[Highland culture]] by [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland Scots]]. Historian Michael Lynch comments that &quot;the Scottishness of Balmoral helped to give the monarchy a truly British dimension for the first time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynch, Michael |title=Scotland: A New History |publisher=Pimlico |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-7126-9893-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria and Albert at Balmoral===
[[File:BalmoralCastle1900.jpg|thumb|right|Balmoral, c.1890–1900]]

Even before the completion of the new house, the pattern of the life of the royal couple in the Highlands was soon established. Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily and Albert spent many days hunting deer and game. In 1849, diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] described their life at Balmoral as resembling that of gentry rather than royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings, and its staff. Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including [[Edwin Landseer|Edwin]] and [[Charles Landseer]], [[Carl Haag]], [[William Wyld]], and [[William Henry Fisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The royal couple took great interest in their staff. They established a lending library.

During the 1850s, new plantations were established near the house and exotic conifers were planted on the grounds. Prince Albert had an active role in these improvements, overseeing the design of [[parterre]]s, the diversion of the main road north of the river via a new bridge, and plans for farm buildings.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; These buildings included a [[model farm|model dairy]] that he developed during 1861, the year of his death. The dairy was completed by Victoria. Subsequently, she also built several monuments to her husband on the estate. These include a pyramid-shaped cairn built a year after Albert's death, on top of ''Craig Lurachain''. A large statue of Albert with a dog and a gun by [[William Theed]], was inaugurated on 15 October 1867, the twenty-eighth anniversary of their engagement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balmoral&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=MacLean|first=Charles|title=Balmoral Highland Estate|publisher=Balmoral Castle and Estate|year=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–21}}&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cairn for Prince Albert Balmoral.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial cairn for Prince Albert, Balmoral Estate]]

Following Albert's death, Victoria spent increasing periods at Balmoral, staying for as long as four months a year during early summer and autumn. Few further changes were made to the grounds, with the exception of some alterations to mountain paths, the erection of various cairns and monuments, and the addition of some cottages (''Karim Cottage'' and ''Baile na Coille'') built for senior staff.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|18}} It was during this period that Victoria began to depend on her servant, [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]]. He was a local [[wikt:gillie|ghillie]] from Crathie, who became one of her closest companions during her long mourning.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|23}}

In 1887, Balmoral Castle was the birthplace of [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria Eugenie]], a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She was born to [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], the fifth daughter of Victoria and Albert. Victoria Eugenie would become the queen of Spain.

In September 1896, Victoria welcomed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] to Balmoral. Four years later Victoria made her last visit to the estate, three months before her death on 22 January 1901.

===After Victoria===

After Victoria's death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits. [[George V]] had substantial improvements made during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], royal visits to Balmoral ceased. In addition, due to the enmity with Germany, ''Danzig Shiel'', a lodge built by Victoria in Ballochbuie was renamed ''Garbh Allt Shiel'' and the &quot;King of Prussia's Fountain&quot; was removed from the grounds.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|25}}

Since the 1950s, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] has added herbaceous borders and a water garden. During the 1980s new staff buildings were built close to the castle.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Balmoral Castle porte cochere.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|The &quot;battlemented&quot; [[porte cochère]]. Also called a &quot;carriage porch&quot;, this structure is covered to protect guests from inclement weather.]]
Though called a castle, Balmoral's primary function is that of a country house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Quercus| isbn = 978-1-62365-543-3| last = Castleden| first = Rodney| title = The Castles of Britain and Ireland| date = 2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a &quot;typical and rather ordinary&quot; country house from the Victorian period. The tower and &quot;pepper pot turrets&quot; are characteristic features of the residence's Scottish Baronial style. The seven-storey tower is an architectural feature borrowed from medieval defensive [[tower house]]s. The &quot;pepper pot&quot; turrets were influenced by the style of 16th-century French [[château]]x. Other features of the Scottish Baronial style are the [[crow-stepped gable]]s, [[dormer]] windows, and [[battlement]]ed [[porte-cochère]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-31850-4| last = Jones| first = Nigel R.| title = Architecture of England, Scotland, and Wales| date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Balmoral is a private property and, unlike the monarch's [[official residence]]s, is not the property of [[the Crown]]. It originally was purchased personally by Prince Albert, rather than the queen, meaning that no revenues from the estate go to Parliament or to the public purse, as would otherwise be the case for property owned outright by the monarch in accord with the [[Civil List Act 1760]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wightman&quot; /&gt; Along with [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk, ownership of Balmoral was inherited by [[Edward VIII]] on his accession in 1936. When he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] later the same year, however, he retained ownership of them. A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham were purchased by Edward's brother and successor to the Crown, [[George VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/SandringhamHouse/History.aspx |title=Sandringham House: History |work=The official website of The British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416104935/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/SandringhamHouse/History.aspx |archive-date=2010-04-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the estate is still owned outright by the monarch, but is managed by Trustees under Deeds of Nomination and Appointment.&lt;ref name=Wightman&gt;{{cite book|last=Wightman|first=Andy|title=The Poor Had No Lawyers|year=2011|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The estate==

===Current extent and operation===

Balmoral Estate is within the [[Cairngorms National Park]] and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar [[National Scenic Area (Scotland)|National Scenic Area]].&lt;ref name=cons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/conservation.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805162711/http://www.balmoralcastle.com/conservation.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|title=Conservation |publisher=Balmoral Estates (archived at web.archive.org|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|50,000|acre|adj=on}} estate contains a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee river valley]] to open mountains. There are seven [[Munro]]s (hills in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft}}) within the estate, the highest being [[Lochnagar]] at {{convert|3789|ft}}. This mountain was the setting for a children's story, ''[[The Old Man of Lochnagar]]'', told originally by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] to his younger brothers, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]]. The story was published in 1980, with royalties accruing to [[The Prince's Trust]].&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|35–51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|1101076|The Old Man of Lochnagar, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate also incorporates the 7,500-acre [[Delnadamph Lodge]] estate, bought by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesJan78&quot;&gt;&quot;The Queen buys grouse moor near Balmoral.&quot; ''The Times'', London, 6 Jan. 1978: pg 3.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--data missing, the 7,500 ___ what? is the figure accurate? the lodge article states a different figure --&gt;

The estate extends to [[Loch Muick]] in the southeast where an old boat house and the Royal [[Bothy]] (hunting lodge) now named ''[[Glas-allt-Shiel]]'', built by Victoria, are located.

The working estate includes [[Red Grouse|grouse moors]], forestry, and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer, [[Highland cattle]], and ponies.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|38–47}} It also offers access to the public for fishing (paid) and hiking during certain seasons.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|36–37}}

Approximately 8,000 acres of the estate are covered by trees, with almost 3,000 acres used for forestry that yields nearly 10,000 tonnes of wood per year. ''Ballochbuie Forest'', one of the largest remaining areas of old Caledonian pine growth in Scotland, consists of approximately 3,000 acres. It is managed with only minimal or no intervention.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|48,51}} The principal mammal on the estate is the [[red deer]] with a population of 2,000 to 2,500 head.&lt;ref name=Balmoral/&gt;{{rp|44}}

The areas of Lochnagar and Ballochbuie were designated in 1998 by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] as [[Special Protection Areas]] (SPA) under the European Union (EU) [[Birds Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/SPA/UK9002281.pdf |title=Lochnagar SPA: Standard Data Form |publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/SPA/UK9002781.pdf |title=Ballolchbuie SPA: Standard Data Form |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public access to gardens and castle grounds===

In 1931, the castle gardens were opened to the public for the first time and they now are open daily between April and the end of July, after which Queen Elizabeth II arrives for her annual stay.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The ballroom is the only room in the castle that may be viewed by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/admissions.htm |title=2011 Admission Charges |publisher=Balmoral Estate |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craigowan Lodge===
Craigowan Lodge is a seven-bedroom&lt;ref name=stv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/east-central/108984-royals-in-scotland-palaces-paparazzi-and-garden-parties/|title=Royals in Scotland: Palaces, paparazzi and garden parties|author=Michael MacLeod|work=STV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; stone house approximately a mile from the main castle in Balmoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.streetvi.com/en/map/gb/419235-Craigowan-Lodge/#/point/57.040842/-3.238704/0/0/0/ |title=Panorama of Lodge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeenshire/298492/queen-arrives-in-royal-deeside-for-holiday/|title=Queen arrives in Royal Deeside for holiday|publisher=Press and Journal|first=Shona|last=Gossip|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More rustic than the castle, the lodge was often the home of Charles and Diana when they visited. Currently, it is used as quarters for important guests.

In the obituary of [[Prince Michael Andreevich of Russia|Michael Andreevich Romanoff]], the highest-ranking member of the Russian imperial family at the time of his death in 2008, it was noted that his family spent most of World War II at Craigowan Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4922121.ece |title=Michael Andreevich Romanoff: member of the Russian imperial family | location=London | work=The Times |date=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lodge has been in the news periodically since 2005, because Elizabeth II and Prince Philip often spend the first few days of their summer holiday there.&lt;ref name=stv/&gt; During each weekend of the summer, the castle is a lucrative source of income from visiting tourists. Sometimes, the Queen arrives at Balmoral before the tourist visiting season is over.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Queen [[Elizabeth II]] was in residence at Balmoral at the time of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997. Her private discussions with then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] were dramatised in the [[Stephen Frears]] film ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' (2006). The 1997 film ''[[Mrs. Brown (film)|Mrs Brown]]'' also was based on events at Balmoral. In both films, however, substitute locations were used: [[Blairquhan Castle]] in ''The Queen''; and [[Duns Castle]] in ''Mrs Brown''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436697/locations |title=Filming locations for ''The Queen'' |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119280/locations |title=Filming locations for ''Mrs Brown'' |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Elizabeth II's visits to Balmoral Castle were also featured in several episodes of the [[Netflix]] series ''[[The_Crown_(TV_series)|The Crown]]''. [[Ardverikie House]] was used as a stand-in for the royal estate for filming purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/arts-and-culture/the-filming-locations-used-in-the-second-season-of-the-crown-claire-foy/ |title=8 spectacular filming locations from The Crown to visit as season 2 returns |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banknote illustration===
Since 1987 an illustration of the castle has been featured on the reverse side of [[Banknotes of Scotland|£100 notes]] issued by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scotbanks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_royal_bank_of_scotland.php|title=Current Banknotes : Royal Bank of Scotland|publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers|accessdate=17 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071445/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_royal_bank_of_scotland.php| archivedate= 3 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
