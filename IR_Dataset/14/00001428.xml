'''Adrian''' is a form of the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[given name]] ''[[Adrianus (disambiguation)|Adrianus]]'' or ''[[Hadrianus (disambiguation)|Hadrianus]]''. Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river [[Adria (river)|Adria]] from the [[Venetic language|Venetic]] and [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] word ''adur'', meaning 'sea' or 'water'.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Room, ''Brewer's Dictionary of Names'', p.7. ({{ISBN|1-85986-323-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Room|2006|p=20}} The name may also come from the Latin word ''atur'' which means 'black' or 'dark.' The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the [[Po River]] into the [[Adriatic Sea]] but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (c.550 - c.476 BC) asserted that both the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] harbor city of [[Adria]] and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spina e il delta padano (Atti del convegno &quot;Spina, due civiltà a confronto&quot;)|editor=Rebecchi, Fernando|first=Simonetta|last=Bonomi|chapter=Adria e Spina|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|year=1998|isbn=88-7062-983-X|ref=bonomi|language=it}}, pp. 241-3&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now [[Atri, Abruzzo|Atri]], in [[Picenum]], which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{DGRG|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=adria-geo |title=Adria |volume=1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--would be nice to have a more recent reference for this--&gt;
