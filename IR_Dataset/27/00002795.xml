The '''Australian Army''' is Australia's military land force. Formed in 1901 through the amalgamation of the [[Colonial forces of Australia|Australian colonial forces]] following [[Federation of Australia|federation]], it is part of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) along with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. While the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of Army]] (CA). The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the [[Minister of Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/da190356/s9.html |title=Defence Act (1903) – SECT 9 Command of Defence Force and arms of Defence Force |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout Australia's history, only during the [[Second World War]] has Australian territory come under direct attack.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Australian Army}}
Formed in March 1901, with the amalgamation of the six separate [[Colonial forces of Australia|colonial military forces]], the history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:
* 1901–47, when limits were set on the size of the regular Army, the vast majority of peacetime soldiers were in reserve units of the [[Citizens Military Force]] (also known as the CMF or Militia), and expeditionary forces (the [[First Australian Imperial Force|First]] and [[Second Australian Imperial Force]]s) were formed to serve overseas,{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=88 &amp; 147}}{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=5}} and
* Post-1947, when a standing peacetime regular [[infantry]] force was formed and the CMF (known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=5}}

[[File:Cavalry scout Iraq.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Australian Cavalry Scout in Iraq, 2007]]

During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), [[First World War]] (1914–18), the [[Second World War]] (1939–45), [[Korean War]] (1950–53), [[Malayan Emergency]] (1950–60), [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]] (1962–66), [[Vietnam War]] (1962–73),{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=}} and more recently in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001 – present) and [[Iraq]] (2003–09).{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=284–285}} Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non-United Nations sponsored [[Multinational Force and Observers]] in the Sinai is a notable exception. Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in [[International Force for East Timor|East Timor]], while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], in the [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]], and in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]], [[Operation Sumatra Assist]], ended on 24 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/peacekeeping/ |title=Australian War Memorial Official History of Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations |accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2015, the Army has deployed a 300-strong element to Iraq, designated as Task Group Taji, as part of [[Operation Okra]]. In support of a capacity building mission, Task Group Taji's main role has been to provide training to Iraqi forces, during which Australian troops have served alongside troops from New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=Department of Defence|title=Troops to deploy to Iraq|date=15 April 2015|url=http://news.defence.gov.au/2015/04/15/troops-to-deploy-to-iraq/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403034719/http://news.defence.gov.au/2015/04/15/troops-to-deploy-to-iraq/|archivedate=3 April 2016|accessdate=3 August 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australia Land Forces 2018.png|thumb|centre|620px|&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;The Australian Army's structure from 2019&lt;/div&gt;]]

The [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] comprises a deployable headquarters, while [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]] under the command of [[Forces Command (Australia)|Forces Command]] is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units. 2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions. The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=195}}

===1st Division===
'''[[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]]''' carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations. It has few combat units permanently assigned to it, although it does currently command the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] as part of Australia's amphibious task group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doran|first1=Mark|title=Amphibious Display|url=http://armynews.realviewdigital.com/?iid=154755#folio=12|work=Army|publisher=Department of Defence|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Forces===
[[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]] comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF. It includes all of Army's [[special forces]] assets.

===Planned restructuring===
Under a restructuring program known as [[Plan Beersheba]] announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author1=Minister for Defence, Minister for Defence Materiel and Parliamentary Secretary for Defence|title=New structure and capability for Army|url=https://defence-ministers.govspace.gov.au/2011/12/12/minister-for-defence-minister-for-defence-materiel-and-parliamentary-secretary-for-defence-new-structure-and-capability-for-army/|date=12 December 2011|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20140802020004/https://defence-ministers.govspace.gov.au/2011/12/12/minister-for-defence-minister-for-defence-materiel-and-parliamentary-secretary-for-defence-new-structure-and-capability-for-army/|archivedate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force will be known as the Amphibious Ready Element and will be embarked on the Navy's new [[Canberra-class landing helicopter dock|''Canberra''-class]] amphibious assault ships.

==Colours, standards and guidons==
{{Main|Colours, standards and guidons}}
[[File:AustArmyColours.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All colours of the Army were on parade for the centenary of the Army, 10 March 2001.]]

Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as &quot;the Colours&quot;.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=53}} Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|pp=55–56}} Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Flags, Military Flags, &amp; Queens and Regimental Colours |publisher=Digger History |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm |accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405154849/http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units awarded [[battle honours]] have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is &quot;Ubique&quot; which means &quot;Everywhere&quot; – although they can receive Honour Titles.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=58}}

The Army is the guardian of the [[Flag of Australia|National Flag]] and as such, unlike the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], does not have a flag or Colours. The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner. To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General [[Sir William Deane]], presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the [[Australian War Memorial]] on 10 March 2001. The Banner was presented to the [[Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (Australia)|Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A)]], Warrant Officer Peter Rosemond.

The Army Banner bears the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]] on the obverse, with the dates &quot;1901–2001&quot; in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the [[Rising Sun (badge)|&quot;rising sun&quot; badge]] of the Australian Army, flanked by seven [[Battle honours|campaign honours]] on small gold-edged scrolls: [[Second Boer War|South Africa]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya-Borneo]], [[Vietnam War|South Vietnam]], and Peacekeeping. The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Army Flags (Australia) |publisher=Flags of the World |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html |accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070403011109/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html| archivedate= 3 April 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==

===Strength===
As of June 2018 the Army had a strength of 47,338 personnel: 29,994 permanent (regular) and 17,346 active reservists (part-time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/annualreports/17-18/Downloads/DAR_2017-18_Complete.pdf|title= Department of Defence Annual Report 2017-18| last=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2019|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=2019-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Standby Reserve has another 12,496 members (as of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Australian National Audit Office |title=Army Reserve Forces |publisher=Australian National Audit Office |location=Canberra |year=2009 |series=Audit Report No. 31 2008–09 |isbn=0-642-81063-X |url=http://www.anao.gov.au/uploads/documents/2008-09_Audit_Report_No.31.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515021310/http://www.anao.gov.au/uploads/documents/2008-09_Audit_Report_No.31.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, women make up 14.3% of the Army – well on track to reach its current goal of 15% by 2023. The number of [[women in the Australian military]] has increased dramatically since 2011 (10%), with the announcement that women will be allowed to serve in frontline combat roles by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/fad/women_armed.htm|title=Women in the ADF Report 2017-18: A Supplement To The Defence Annual Report 201718| last=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2019|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=2019-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rank and insignia===
{{Main|Australian Army officer rank insignia|Australian Army enlisted rank insignia}}
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the [[British Army]], and carry mostly the same actual [[Australian Army officer rank insignia|insignia]]. For [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title &quot;Australia&quot;. The [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] [[Australian Army enlisted rank insignia|insignia]] are the same up until [[Warrant Officer]], where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows:
# Private (PTE) – OR-2
# Private Proficient (PTE(P)) Also used within the Private equivalent ranks – OR-3
# Lance Corporal or Lance Bombardier (LCPL or LBDR) – OR-4
# Corporal or Bombardier (CPL or BDR) – OR-5
# Sergeant (SGT) – OR-6
# Staff Sergeant (SSGT) – OR-7 (SSGT is being phased out of the Australian Army)
# Warrant Officer Class Two (WO2) – OR-8
# Warrant Officer Class One (WO1) – OR-9
# Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) – OR-9 (This is an appointment rather than a rank)
# Second Lieutenant (2LT) – OF-1
# Lieutenant (LT) – OF-2
# Captain (CAPT) – OF-3
# Major (MAJ) – OF-4
# Lieutenant Colonel (LTCOL) – OF-5
# Colonel (COL) – OF-6
# Brigadier (BRIG) – OF-7. Like the United Kingdom, prior to 1922 Australia used the rank Brigadier General
# Major General (MAJGEN) – OF-8
# Lieutenant General (LTGEN) – OF-9
# General (GEN) – OF-10
# Field Marshal (FM) – OF-11. This rank is generally reserved for wartime and ceremonial purposes; there are no regular appointments to the rank. Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] is the only Australian-born officer promoted to the rank. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], is currently the only living holder of the rank of Field Marshal in the Australian Army. The Duke, however, does not have any active role in the Australian command structure.

==Australian Army Journal==
Since June 1948, the Australian Army has published its own journal titled the ''Australian Army Journal''. The journal's first editor was Colonel [[Eustace Graham Keogh|Eustace Keogh]], and initially, it was intended to assume the role that the ''Army Training Memoranda'' had filled during the Second World War, although its focus, purpose, and format has shifted over time.{{sfn|Dennis|1995|p=60}} Covering a broad range of topics including essays, book reviews and editorials, with submissions from serving members as well as professional authors, the journal's stated goal is to provide &quot;...the primary forum for Army's professional discourse... [and to facilitate]... debate within the Australian Army ...[and raise] ...the quality and intellectual rigor of that debate by adhering to a strict and demanding standard of quality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-future/Publications/Australian-Army-Journal |title=Australian Army Journal |work=Publications |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the journal was placed on hiatus as the ''Defence Force Journal'' began publication;{{sfn|Dennis|1995|p=60}} however, publishing of the ''Australian Army Journal'' began again in 1999 and since then the journal has been published largely on a quarterly basis, with only minimal interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Our-future/Publications/Australian-Army-Journal/Archive |title=Past editions: Australian Army Journal |work=Publications |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=3 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312150357/http://www.army.gov.au/Our-future/Publications/Australian-Army-Journal/Archive |archivedate=12 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future procurement==
This list includes equipment currently on order or a requirement which has been identified:
* A replacement for the [[Eurocopter Tiger|Tiger ARH]] helicopter was identified in the 2016 Defence White Paper. The Army is set to retire the helicopter earlier than expected after encountering numerous issues with sustainment and serviceability rates. While the Tigers were initially supposed to get a $1–2&amp;nbsp;billion mid-life upgrade, a new type of helicopter—either manned, unmanned or a combination of both—is set to enter service from the mid 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A new medium-range air defence system is also to be acquired in the late 2020s. The new system will help defend deployed airfields, command centres and other valuable assets from enemy air attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The Army has lacked a medium-range air defence system capability since the [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier's]] retirement in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Land-based anti-ship missiles were outlined as a new requirement in the 2016 Defence White Paper to defend deployed forces as well as offshore assets such as oil and natural gas platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* The Australian Government committed to improving the systems that individual soldiers use. Items outlined in the DWP include &quot;weapons and targeting equipment, digital communications systems, body armour and self protection equipment (including for chemical, biological and radiological threats), and night fighting equipment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* 1,100 [[Hawkei]] protected mobility vehicles are currently being procured at a cost of around $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* The [[Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle|Bushmaster PMV]] is to be replaced beginning in 2025 by a new platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* Land 400 phase 2 replacement program is set to replace the existing 257 [[ASLAV]]s with 211 [[Boxer (armoured fighting vehicle)|Boxers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/equippingdefence/land400 |title=Land Combat Vehicle System |publisher=Department of Defence |accessdate=3 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Land 400 phase 3 replacement program is set to replace 431 [[M113 APC|M113AS3/4 APCs]].
* To complement current artillery, a new class of long-range rocket artillery is to be introduced in the mid 2020s. The new system, yet to be named, will be able to provide fire support for troops at three hundred kilometres.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* A riverine patrol capability is to be re-established in 2022. The capability will be established around a fleet of small, lightly armed [[Patrol boat|patrol vessels]] to allow access to a range of different environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* The Army has outlined a need for enhanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability. With this, they plan to acquire a fleet of armed, medium-range unmanned aerial vehicles along with regular capability updates. They will provide enhanced firepower and ISR as well as a counter-terrorism ability overseas. They will also assist in humanitarian and relief missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
