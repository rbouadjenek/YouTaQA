The '''Au file format''' is a simple [[audio file format]] introduced by [[Sun Microsystems]]. The format was common on [[NeXT]] systems and on early Web pages. Originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit [[mu-law|μ-law]]-encoded data at an 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz sample rate. Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192&amp;nbsp;Hz, often integer multiples of video clock signal frequencies. Newer files have a header that consists of six [[Signedness|unsigned]] [[32-bit]] words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in [[big endian]] format).

Although the format now supports many [[digital audio|audio encoding]] formats, it remains associated with the [[mu-law|μ-law]] logarithmic encoding. This encoding was native to the [[SPARCstation 1]] hardware, where [[SunOS]] exposed the encoding to application programs through the /dev/audio interface. This encoding and interface became a [[de facto]] standard for [[Unix]] sound.

==New format==
All fields are stored in [[big-endian]] format, including the sample data.

The type of encoding depends on the value of the &quot;encoding&quot; field (word 3 of the header). Formats 2 through 7 are uncompressed linear [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], therefore technically [[lossless]] (although not necessarily free of [[Quantization (signal_processing)|quantization error]], especially in 8-bit form). Formats 1 and 27 are [[μ-law algorithm|μ-law]] and [[A-law]], respectively, both [[companding]] logarithmic representations of PCM, and arguably lossy as they pack what would otherwise be almost 16 bits of dynamic range into 8 bits of encoded data, even though this is achieved by an altered dynamic response and no data is actually &quot;thrown away&quot;. Formats 23 through 26 are ADPCM, which is an early form of [[lossy compression]], usually but not always with 4 bits of encoded data per audio sample (for 4:1 efficiency with 16-bit input, or 2:1 with 8-bit; equivalent to e.g. encoding CD quality MP3 at a 352kbit rate using a low quality encoder). Several of the others are [[digital signal processing|DSP]] commands or data, designed to be processed by the [[NeXT]] [[Music Kit]] software.

Note: PCM formats are encoded as signed data (as opposed to unsigned).

Following the header structure is a variable-length annotation field.  The contents of this field are currently undefined, except that its length must be a multiple of eight bytes and it must be terminated with at least one null (zero) byte. The audio data segment begins on an eight-byte boundary immediately following the annotation field. Audio data is encoded in the format identified by the file header. The current implementation supports only a single audio data segment per file. The variable-length annotation field is currently ignored by most audio applications.
