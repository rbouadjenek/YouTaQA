'''Amy Lee Grant''' (born November 25, 1960) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, author and [[media personality]]. She is known for performing [[contemporary Christian music]] (CCM) and for a successful crossover to pop music in the 1980s and 1990s. She has been referred to as &quot;The Queen of Christian Pop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=131919 |title=Interview With Amy Grant and Vince Gill|publisher=ABC News|date=October 3, 2002 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brounstein |first=Laura |url=http://www.lhj.com/style/covers/in-perfect-harmony-vince-gill-amy-grant/ |title=In Perfect Harmony: Vince Gill &amp; Amy Grant |work=Ladies' Home Journal |date=November 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729044913/http://www.lhj.com/style/covers/in-perfect-harmony-vince-gill-amy-grant/ |archivedate=July 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her debut as a teenager, and gained fame in [[Christian music]] during the 1980s with such hits as &quot;Father's Eyes&quot;, &quot;[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]&quot;. In the mid-1980s, she began broadening her audience and soon became one of the first [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] artists to [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] into mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albums ''[[Unguarded (Amy Grant album)|Unguarded]]'' and ''[[Lead Me On (Amy Grant album)|Lead Me On]]''. In 1986, she scored her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No.&amp;nbsp;1 song in a duet with [[Peter Cetera]], &quot;[[The Next Time I Fall]]&quot;. In 1991, she released the blockbuster album ''[[Heart in Motion]]'' which became her best-selling album to date, topping the ''Billboard'' Christian album chart for 32 weeks, selling five million copies in the U.S., and producing her second No.&amp;nbsp;1 pop single &quot;[[Baby Baby (Amy Grant song)|Baby Baby]]&quot;. She is the author of several books, including a memoir, ''[[Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far]]'', and a book based on the popular Christmas song &quot;[[Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)]]&quot; which she co-wrote.

== Background ==
=== Early life and career ===

Born in [[Augusta, Georgia]], Grant is the youngest of four sisters. Her family settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Amy|first=Grant|title=Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far|year=2007|publisher=Flying Dolphin Press|isbn=978-0-385-52289-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mosaicpiecesofmy00gran/page/198 198–203]|url=https://archive.org/details/mosaicpiecesofmy00gran/page/198}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a great-granddaughter of Nashville philanthropist [[A. M. Burton]] (founder of Life and Casualty Insurance Company, eponym of Nashville's [[Life &amp; Casualty Tower]], [[WLAC]] Radio, and [[WLAC-TV]]) and Lillie Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Burton Pinched Pennies, then Gave most of Fortune Away.|last=Carey|first=Bill|date=December 7, 2003|work=The Tennessean|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Learn Nashville|last=Zepp|first=George|date=September 6, 2006|work=The Tennessean|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=L&amp;C Tower at 40|date=October 30, 1997|work=Nashville Banner|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=70 YEARS ALOFT: 1]|last=Loew|first=Karen|date=November 17, 2002|work=The Tennessean|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=50 Years of Channel 5 CORRECTION APPENDED]|last=Beck|first=Ken|date=August 4, 2004|work=The Tennessean|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has acknowledged the influence of the Burtons on her development as a musician, starting with their common membership in Nashville's Ashwood [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Seth |last = Robertson |url = http://news.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbiltmagazine/amy-grant-82-finds-inspiration-and-purpose-in-the-power-of-community/ |title = Shining through: Amy Grant, '82, finds inspiration and purpose in the power of community |magazine = Vanderbilt Magazine |volume = 96 |date = Winter 2015 |pages = 30–35 }} See esp. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Grant wrote her first song (&quot;Mountain Top&quot;), performed in public for the first time at [[Harpeth Hall School]], the all-girls school she attended in Nashville. She recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader [[Brown Bannister]]. When Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, [[Chris Christian]], the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called [[Word Records]]. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album, ''[[Amy Grant (album)|Amy Grant]]'', produced by Brown Bannister, who would also produce her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year at [[Furman University]]. In May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album, ''[[My Father's Eyes (album)|My Father's Eyes]]'', Grant met [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], who had written the title track and would become her first husband.  Grant and Chapman toured together in mid-1979. In late 1980, she transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]], where she was a member of the sorority [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaic&quot;/&gt; Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—''[[Never Alone (Amy Grant album)|Never Alone]]'', followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (''[[In Concert (Amy Grant album)|In Concert]]'' and ''[[In Concert Volume Two (Amy Grant album)|In Concert Volume Two]]''), both backed by an augmented edition of the [[DeGarmo and Key|DeGarmo &amp; Key]] band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. To date, Grant continues to take off her shoes midway through performances, as she has said, &quot;it is just more comfortable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Preston and Steve'' radio show excerpt; May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feet.thefuntimesguide.com/2008/05/celebrity_barefoot_in_public.php |title=feet.thefuntimesguide.com |publisher=feet.thefuntimesguide.com |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1982 saw the release of her breakthrough album ''[[Age to Age]]''. The album contains the signature track, &quot;[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]&quot; (written by [[Michael Card]]) and the Grant-Chapman penned song, &quot;In a Little While&quot;. &quot;El Shaddai&quot; was later awarded one of the &quot;[[Songs of the Century]]&quot; by the [[RIAA]] in 2001. Grant received her first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as two [[GMA Dove Awards]] for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year. ''Age to Age'' became the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriter [[Michael W. Smith]]. Grant and Smith continue to have a strong friendship and creative relationship, often writing songs for or contributing vocals to each other's albums, and as of 2019, often touring together annually during November and December putting on Christmas concerts. During the 1980s, Grant was also a backup singer for [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]].&lt;ref name=&quot;billgaither&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprofile.com/article/5501.html|title=Bill Gaither: The Gospel of Giving|accessdate=April 25, 2009|publisher=American Profile|author=Beverly Keel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129120135/http://www.americanprofile.com/article/5501.html|archivedate=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant followed this album with the first of her Christmas albums, which would later be the basis for her holiday shows. In 1984, she released another pop-oriented Christian hit, ''[[Straight Ahead (Amy Grant album)|Straight Ahead]]'', earning Grant her first appearance at the [[Grammy Awards]] show in 1985. The head of [[NBC]] took notice of Grant's performance and called her manager to book her for her own Christmas special.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaic&quot;/&gt;

=== Widening audience ===

Hardly had Grant established herself as the &quot;Queen of Christian Pop&quot; when she changed directions to widen her fan base (and hence her musical message). Her goal was to become the first Christian singer-songwriter who was also successful as a contemporary pop singer.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/ung/85jun6rollingstone.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120231852/http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/ung/85jun6rollingstone.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 20, 2008|title=Amy Grant wants to put God on the charts|accessdate=August 30, 2011|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 6, 1985|author=Michael Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Unguarded (Amy Grant album)|Unguarded]]'' (1985) surprised some fans for its very mainstream sound (and Grant's leopard-print jacket, in four poses for four different covers). &quot;[[Find a Way (Amy Grant song)|Find a Way]]&quot;, from ''Unguarded'', became the first non-Christmas Christian song to hit [[The Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Top 40]] list{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, also reaching No. 7 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. She also scored No.&amp;nbsp;18 on ''Billboard'' AC in 1986 with &quot;[[Stay for Awhile]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Grant scored her first ''Billboard'' No. 1 song in 1986 with &quot;[[The Next Time I Fall]]&quot;, a duet with former [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] singer/bassist [[Peter Cetera]]. That year, she also recorded a duet with singer [[Randy Stonehill]] for his ''[[Love Beyond Reason]]'' album, titled &quot;I Could Never Say Goodbye&quot;, and recorded ''The Animals' Christmas'' with [[Art Garfunkel]].

''[[Lead Me On (Amy Grant album)|Lead Me On]]'' (1988) contained many songs that were about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it as not being an obviously &quot;Christian&quot; record. Years later, ''Lead Me On'' would be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time by ''[[CCM Magazine]]''. The mainstream song &quot;Saved by Love&quot; was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay and [[Crossover (music)|crossed over]] to No. 96 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and &quot;1974 (We Were Young)&quot; and &quot;Saved By Love&quot; also charted as Adult Contemporary songs. In 1989, she appeared in a [[Target Corporation|Target]] ad campaign, performing songs off the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;target&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v28/ai_8089589 |title=Rabbit stars in Target holiday promo – Target Stores Inc., Velveteen Rabbit |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |publisher=Gale Group |year=1989 |author=Gale Group |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912051613/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v28/ai_8089589/ |archivedate=September 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the mainstream ===

[[File:Amy Grant in 1998.jpg|thumb|Grant during her ''Behind the Eyes'' tour in 1998]]
When ''[[Heart in Motion]]'' was released in 1991, many fans were surprised that the album was so clearly one of contemporary pop music. Grant's desire to widen her audience was frowned upon by the confines of the popular definitions of ministry at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;fans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/him/5.html#t|title=Christian Fans Ask Too Much of Amy Grant|accessdate=August 29, 2008|work=The Arizona Republic|date=May 18, 1991|first=Kim Sue Lia|last=Perkes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313110334/http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/him/5.html#t|archive-date=March 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track &quot;[[Baby Baby (Amy Grant song)|Baby Baby]]&quot; (written for Grant's newborn daughter Millie, of whom Grant wrote, her &quot;six-week-old face was my inspiration&quot;) became a pop hit (hitting No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. &quot;Baby Baby&quot; received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories). Four other hits from the album made the Pop top 20: &quot;[[Every Heartbeat]]&quot; (No. 2), &quot;[[That's What Love Is For]]&quot; (No. 7), &quot;[[Good for Me (song)|Good for Me]]&quot; (No. 8), and &quot;[[I Will Remember You (Amy Grant song)|I Will Remember You]]&quot; (No. 20). On the Adult Contemporary chart, all five songs were top 10 hits, with two of the five (&quot;Baby Baby&quot; and &quot;That's What Love Is For&quot;) reaching No. 1. Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atop ''Billboard'' Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. ''Heart in Motion'' is Grant's best-selling album, having sold over five million copies according to the RIAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=Heart%20In%20Motion&amp;artist=Grant&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=Amy Grant – RIAA|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=RIAA|year=2008|author=RIAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album, ''[[Home For Christmas (Amy Grant album)|Home For Christmas]]'' in 1992, which included the song &quot;[[Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)]]&quot;, written by [[Chris Eaton (UK musician)|Chris Eaton]] and Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, including [[Donna Summer]], [[Jessica Simpson]] (who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists), [[Vince Gill]], [[Sara Groves]], [[Point of Grace]], [[Gladys Knight]], and Broadway star [[Barbara Cook]].

''[[House of Love (Amy Grant album)|House of Love]]'' in 1994 continued in the same vein, boasting catchy pop songs mingled with spiritual lyrics. The album was a multi-platinum success and produced the pop hit &quot;[[Lucky One (song)|Lucky One]]&quot; (No. 18 pop and No. 2 AC; No. 1 on [[Radio &amp; Records]]) as well as the title track (a duet with country music star and future husband [[Vince Gill]]) (No. 37 pop) and a cover of Joni Mitchell's frequently covered &quot;[[Big Yellow Taxi]]&quot; (No. 67 pop) (in which she changed the line &quot;And they charged the people ''a dollar and a half'' just to see'em&quot; to &quot;And then they charged the people ''25 bucks'' just to see'em&quot;).

After she covered the [[10cc]] song &quot;[[The Things We Do for Love (song)|The Things We Do for Love]]&quot; for the ''[[Mr. Wrong (film)|Mr. Wrong]]'' soundtrack, ''[[Behind the Eyes (Amy Grant album)|Behind the Eyes]]'' was released in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her &quot;razor blades and [[Prozac]]&quot; album.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/2001/50.html |title=Amy Grant's career comes full circle |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=September 15, 2002 |first=Rosa |last=Colucci |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612215414/http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/2001/50.html |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although &quot;[[Takes a Little Time (Amy Grant song)|Takes a Little Time]]&quot; was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum. ''Behind The Eyes'' was eventually certified Gold by the [[RIAA]]. The video for &quot;Takes a Little Time&quot; was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of New York City, and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up &quot;Behind The Eyes&quot; with ''[[A Christmas to Remember (album)|A Christmas To Remember]]'', her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified Gold in 2000.

In 2001, Grant sang &quot;[[God Bless America]]&quot; in front of a sellout crowd at the Owen County Fair Grounds in [[Spencer, Indiana]]. She dedicated her performance to the victims of [[9/11]], and officially started the Demolition Derby. Following the 9/11 attacks, Grant's &quot;[[I Will Remember You (Amy Grant song)|I Will Remember You]]&quot; saw a resurgence in popularity as many radio DJs mixed a special tribute version of the song. That same year, Grant won $125,000 for charity on the &quot;Rock Star Edition&quot; of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,98722,00.html |title=Million Dollar Babies |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |author=Liane Bonin |date=February 9, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007163747/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C98722%2C00.html |archivedate=October 7, 2008 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to her roots ===

Grant returned to her roots with the 2002 release of an album of [[hymns]] titled ''[[Legacy... Hymns and Faith]]''. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[pop music|pop]] and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/legacyhymns-faith-mw0000219271|title=Legacy...Hymns &amp; Faith – Amy Grant – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic|author=Robert L. Doerschuk|website=AllMusic|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant followed this up with ''[[Simple Things (Amy Grant album)|Simple Things]]'' in 2003. The album did not have the success of her previous pop or gospel efforts. Soon after ''Simple Things'', Grant and [[Interscope]]/A&amp;M parted ways. The same year, Grant was inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] by the [[Gospel Music Association]], an industry trade organization of which she is a longstanding member, in her first year of eligibility. Grant released a sequel in 2005 titled ''[[Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rock-of-ageshymns-faith-mw0000209405|title=Rock of Ages...Hymns &amp; Faith – Amy Grant – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant joined the reality television phenomenon by hosting ''[[Three Wishes (TV series)|Three Wishes]]'', a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;tw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/three_wishes/series_about.jhtml|title=Three Wishes|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=[[Country Music Television]], Inc.|year=2008|author=CMT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted on [[NBC]] in the fall of 2005 but was canceled at the end of its first season because of high production costs. After ''Three Wishes'' was canceled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award for ''Rock of Ages... Hymns &amp; Faith''. In a February 2006 webchat, Grant stated she believes her &quot;best music is still ahead&quot;.
[[File:Amy Grant October 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Grant performing in October 2008]]
In April 2006, a live CD/DVD titled ''[[Time Again... Amy Grant Live]]'' was recorded in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], at [[Bass Performance Hall]]. (Grant's first paid public performance was at the Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth.) The concert was released on September 26, 2006. In addition to receiving a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], media appearances included write-ups in ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', and a performance on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.

In a February 2007 web chat on her web site, Grant discussed a book she was working on titled ''[[Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far]]'', saying, &quot;It's not an autobiography, but more a collection of memories, song lyrics, poetry and a few pictures.&quot; The book was released on October 16, 2007. In November, it debuted at No. 35 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/bestseller/1104besthardnonfiction.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Hardcover Nonfiction|accessdate=December 6, 2007|work=The New York Times| date=November 4, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150209120156/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/bestseller/1104besthardnonfiction.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin| archivedate=February 9, 2015| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same web chat, Grant noted that she is &quot;anxious to get back in the studio after the book is finished, and reinvent myself as an almost-50 performing woman&quot;.

In 2010, Grant released ''[[Somewhere Down the Road (Amy Grant album)|Somewhere Down the Road]]'', featuring the hit single &quot;[[Better Than a Hallelujah]]&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 on ''Billboard'' Top Christian Songs chart. When asked about the new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, &quot;... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs have the ability to connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/amy-grant-somewhere-down-the-road-goodwyn.aspx Amy Grant: &quot;Somewhere Down the Road&quot;].

== Personal life ==

On June 19, 1982, Grant married fellow Christian musician [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]]. Their marriage produced three children.&lt;ref name=&quot;orr-amy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/sep/36.html#t |title=Amy starts over: Grant picks up pieces after divorce, with the help of her soaring career and, yes, Vince Gill |access-date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=John Lam |date=October 9, 1999 |first=Jay |last=Orr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629014306/http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/sep/36.html |archive-date=June 29, 2008  }} Article text from [[The Tennessean]] included in Lam's Amy Grant website.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, she filed for divorce from Chapman, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;, and the divorce was finalized three months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;orr-amy&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Amy Grant and Vince Gill.jpg|thumb|Grant with husband [[Vince Gill]] in 2004]]
On March 10, 2000, Grant married country singer-songwriter [[Vince Gill]], who had been previously married to country singer Janis Oliver of [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20129901,00.html |title=Finally a Duet |accessdate=December 25, 2008 |work=People |date=November 29, 1999 |author=Erik Meers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205020742/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0%2C%2C20129901%2C00.html |archivedate=February 5, 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant and Gill have one daughter together, Corrina Grant Gill, born March 12, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;people2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20133970,00.html|title=In Perfect Harmony|accessdate=December 25, 2008|date=March 26, 2000|work=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 1999 ''CCM Magazine'', Grant explained why she left Chapman and married Gill: {{quote|I didn't get a divorce because 'I had a great marriage and then along came Vince Gill.' Gary and I had a rocky road from day one. I think what was so hard—and this is (what) one of our counselors said—sometimes an innocent party can come into a situation, and they're like a big spotlight. What they do is reveal, by comparison, the painful dynamics that are already in existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCM1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/ccmmag/99nov/cover_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000301120523/http://www.ccmmagazine.com/ccmmag/99nov/cover_story.html|archive-date=March 1, 2000|title=Judging Amy|publisher=CCM (Contemporary Christian Music)|date=November 1999|author=Gregory Rumburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Public views and perception ==

Among praise for her contributions to the Contemporary Christian genre, Grant has also generated controversy within the Christian community, from &quot;complaints that she was too worldly and too sexy&quot; to a &quot;barrage of condemnation&quot; following her divorce and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2D81F30F932A25756C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Religion Journal; A Chastened Singer Returns to Christian Basics |accessdate=January 12, 2009 |last=Rabey |first=Steve |date=May 11, 2002 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview early in her career, Grant stated, &quot;I have a healthy sense of right and wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/ung/8.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018082843/http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/ung/8.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 18, 2005 |title=Amy Grant: 'I'm Not a Prude.' |access-date=July 5, 2012 |last=Jahr |first=Cliff |date=December 1985 |work=Amy Grant Article Archive |publisher=Ladies' Home Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: &quot;We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded it in such a way that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/amy-grant/features/amy-s-own-words/ |title=Amy's Own Words |accessdate=July 12, 2012 |last=Styll |first=John |work=todayschristianmusic.com |publisher=Today's Christian Music |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109021517/http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/amy-grant/features/amy-s-own-words/ |archive-date=November 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
