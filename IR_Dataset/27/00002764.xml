'''AbiWord''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|i|w|ɜr|d}}) is a [[free and open-source software]] [[word processor]]. It was originally written in [[C++]] and since version 3 it is based on [[GTK+]] 3. The name &quot;AbiWord&quot; is derived from the root of the Spanish word &quot;''[[wikt:en:abierto#Spanish|abierto]]''&quot;, meaning &quot;open&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abi&quot;&gt;Project Mascot [http://www.abisource.com/~abi/ Abi the Ant]. Page explains &quot;Abi&quot; is pronounced just like &quot;Abby&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

AbiWord was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite but was adopted by open source developers after SourceGear changed its business focus and ceased development. It now runs on [[Linux]], [[ReactOS]], Solaris, [[AmigaOS]] 4.0 (through its [[Cygnix]] [[X Window System|X11]] engine), [[MeeGo]] (on the [[Nokia N9]] smartphone), [[Maemo]] (on the [[Nokia N810]]) [[QNX]] and other [[operating system]]s. Development of a version for [[Microsoft Windows]] has ended due to lack of maintainers (the latest released versions are 2.8.6 and 2.9.4 beta &lt;ref&gt;https://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.9.4/Windows/&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[macOS]] port has remained on version 2.4 since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

AbiWord is part of the AbiSource project which develops a number of [[office suite|office-related]] technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;abisource&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Features==
AbiWord supports both basic word processing features such as lists, indents and character formats, and more sophisticated features including tables, styles, page headers and footers, [[Note (typography)|footnotes]], templates, multiple views, page columns, [[spell checker|spell checking]], and [[grammar checker|grammar checking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar-check&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with version 2.8.0, AbiWord includes a [[collaborative software|collaboration]] plugin that allows integration with AbiCollab.net, a Web-based service that permits multiple users to work on the same document [[Collaborative real-time editor|in real time]], in full synchronization. The Presentation view of AbiWord, which permits easy display of presentations created in AbiWord on &quot;screen-sized&quot; pages, is another feature not often found in word processors.

===Interface===
AbiWord generally works similarly to classic versions (pre-Office 2007) of [[Microsoft Word]], as direct ease of migration was a high priority early goal. While many interface similarities remain, cloning the Word interface is no longer a top priority. The interface is intended to follow user interface guidelines for each respective platform.

===File formats===
AbiWord comes with several import and export filters providing a partial support for such formats as [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Word]] (.doc), [[Office Open XML]] (.docx),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Plug-in filters are available to deal with many other formats, notably [[WordPerfect]] documents. The native [[file format]], .abw, uses [[XML]], so as to mitigate [[vendor lock-in]] concerns with respect to interoperability and [[digital archiving]].

===Grammar checking===
The AbiWord project includes a US English-only grammar checking plugin using [[Link Grammar]]. AbiWord had grammar checking before any other open source word processor, although a grammar checker was later added to [[OpenOffice.org]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar-check&quot; /&gt; Link Grammar is both a theory of syntax and an open source parser which is now{{When|date=May 2010}} developed by the AbiWord project.
