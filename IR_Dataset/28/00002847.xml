'''Aung San Suu Kyi''' ({{IPAc-en|aʊ|ŋ|ˌ|s|æ|n|.|s|uː|ˈ|tʃ|iː}}; {{MYname|MY=အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်|MLCTS=aung hcan: cu. krany}} {{IPA-my|àʊɰ̃ sʰáɰ̃ sṵ tɕì}}; born 19 June 1945) is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] politician, diplomat, author, and a 1991 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate. The first and incumbent [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]] (a position akin to a prime minister leader) of Myanmar, she is also the leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] and played a vital role in the state's transition from military junta to partial democracy. Of late, she has attracted considerable criticism for having enabled the state-perpetrated genocide of Rohingyas.

The youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the United Nations for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, with whom she had two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the [[1990 Burmese general election|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s. In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named her one of the &quot;Children of [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]&quot; and his spiritual heir to [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeTCOG&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993026,00.html|title=The Children of Gandhi|date=31 December 1999|work=Time|format=excerpt|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013134/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C993026%2C00.html|archivedate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her party boycotted the [[2010 Myanmar general election|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[2012 Burmese by-elections|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[2015 Myanmar general election|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] – well more than the 67% [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]]. 

Since ascending to the office of State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn criticism from several countries, organisations and figures over her alleged inaction in response to the [[Rohingya genocide|genocide of the Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]] and refusal to accept that Myanmar's military has committed massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|title=Did the World Get Aung San Suu Kyi Wrong?|first1=Amanda|last1=Taub|first2=Max|last2=Fisher|date=31 October 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114095109/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|title=What Happened to Myanmar's Human-Rights Icon?|first=Hannah|last=Beech|date=25 September 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114145201/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|title=Dispatches – On Demand – All 4|publisher=Channel 4|access-date=14 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515112236/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|archive-date=15 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrJ7FgNyTNbhNAA3RtXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1530149261/RO=10/RU=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-genocide_us_5ab14dd7e4b008c9e5f1fc90/RK=2/RS=g1Tivi.NDd5FfxVlfFFrf5LyFn4-|title=rohingya genocide}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 12 November 2018 [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal amnesty betrayal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112211037/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal |date=12 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under her leadership, Myanmar has also drawn criticism for prosecutions of journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters-Nebehay&quot; /&gt; In 2019, Suu Kyi appeared in the [[International Court of Justice]] where she defended the Burmese military against allegations of genocide against the Rohingya.&lt;ref name=&quot;alj-zarni&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Khin Kyi and family.jpg|thumb|100px|A portrait of Khin Kyi and her family in 1948. Aung San Suu Kyi is seated on the floor.]]
Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now [[Yangon]]), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Popham |first=Peter |date=April 2013 |title=The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCL1drLmsmQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;q=%22hmway%20saung%22 |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Experiment, LLC |page=163 |isbn=978-1-61519-081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Aung San]], allied with the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during World War II. Aung San founded the [[Tatmadaw|modern Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; he was [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|assassinated by his rivals]] in the same year. She grew up with her mother, [[Khin Kyi]], and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of [[Bogyoke Aung San Museum|the house]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel.org&quot; /&gt; Her elder brother emigrated to [[San Diego]], California, becoming a [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel.org&quot; /&gt; After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to [[54 University Avenue|a house]] by [[Inya Lake]] where Aung San Suu Kyi met people of various backgrounds, political views and religions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]] (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks four languages: Burmese, English, French and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi: A Biography, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Theravada]] Buddhist.

Suu Kyi's mother, [[Khin Kyi]], gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to [[India]] and [[Nepal]] in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there.

In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Aung San Suu Kyi met, as Aung San Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas.&lt;ref name = &quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997 which was later found to be [[terminal illness|terminal]].

She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the [[military junta]]'s assurance that she could return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm |date=5 March 2016 }}.

==Political career==

===Political beginning===
Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.&lt;ref name=&quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; However, in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power.

During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, [[U Nu]], initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu's plan by saying &quot;the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people&quot;.

In 1990, the military junta called a [[1990 Burmese general election|general election]], in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats.

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and [[Kyi Maung]], was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 [[kyat]]s (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken.

===United Nations involvement===
The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[military junta|junta]] and Aung San Suu Kyi.&lt;ref name = &quot;azjarp&quot;/&gt; On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move &quot;because we are confident that we can trust each other&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed &quot;a new dawn for the country&quot;. However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a [[Depayin massacre|government-sponsored mob attacked]] her caravan in the northern village of [[Tabayin|Depayin]], murdering and wounding many of her supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=4 February 2007 |date=30 May 2005 |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Burma Caucus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614185341/http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching [[Ye-U]]. The government imprisoned her at [[Insein Prison]] in Rangoon. After she underwent a [[hysterectomy]] in September 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3119038.stm | title =Suu Kyi has 'major' operation | publisher =BBC News | date =19 September 2003 | accessdate =4 July 2006 | location =London | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070623182456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3119038.stm | archive-date =23 June 2007 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt; the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; [[Razali Ismail]], UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 | title =Annan expresses sadness for the resignation of his envoy for Burma | publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma | date =10 January 2006 | accessdate =4 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172156/http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later in 2006, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], UN [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Undersecretary-General]] (USG) of [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department of Political Affairs]], met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 May 2006 |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1= |title=After meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, UN envoy leaves Burma|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060528170633/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1=| archivedate= 28 May 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met with Suu Kyi later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2006/11/11/010-emissaire-suukyi.shtml |title=Rare visite |accessdate=12 January 2007 |date=8 January 2007 |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114034450/http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2006/11/11/010-emissaire-suukyi.shtml |archive-date=14 January 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing [[Than Shwe]] and other members of the senior leadership in [[Naypyidaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN envoy meets with Burma's top general to discuss 'current situation' |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24129 |publisher=UN News Service |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310154920/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24129 |archive-date=10 March 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[State television]] broadcast Aung San Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice. This was Aung San Suu Kyi's first appearance in state media in the four years since her current detention began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma junta releases footage of Suu Kyi (AFP) |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/06/2052595.htm |publisher=ABC News (Australia) |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095451/http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/06/2052595.htm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;unWrkGrp&quot;&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/wgad/9-2004.html Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v.

E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.1 at 47 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government's reply, &quot;Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety&quot;, and while &quot;it could have instituted legal action against her under the country's domestic legislation&amp;nbsp; ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unWrkGrp&quot; /&gt;

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=19 January 2007 |date=18 January 2008 |work=The New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417044209/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2007|date=8 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was &quot;deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Heilprin |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta |work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054213/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |archivedate=14 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
