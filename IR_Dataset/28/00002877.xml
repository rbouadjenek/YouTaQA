'''Augustine of Canterbury''' (born first third of the 6th century&amp;nbsp;– died probably 26 May 604) was a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monk]] who became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the year 597. He is considered the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot; and a founder of the [[Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England|English Church]].&lt;ref name=DictSaint&gt;Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was the [[prior]] of a monastery in [[Rome]] when Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the [[Gregorian mission]], to Britain to [[Christianization|Christianize]] King [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]] and his [[Kingdom of Kent]] from [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]. Kent was probably chosen because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess, [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert I]] the [[List of Frankish kings|King of Paris]], who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning back, but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of [[Canterbury]].

King Æthelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a [[bishop]] and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native British bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at [[London]], and [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 604, and a school was founded to train [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the [[consecration]] of his successor, [[Laurence of Canterbury]]. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a [[saint]].

== Background to the mission ==
After the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legions]] from their province of [[Britannia]] in 410, the inhabitants were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the [[Saxons]]. Before the Roman withdrawal, Britannia had been converted to Christianity and produced the [[ascetic]] [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name=Hindley3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr78/&gt; Britain sent three bishops to the [[Synod of Arles (314)|Council of Arles]] in 314, and a [[Roman Gaul|Gaulish]] bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.&lt;ref name=Frend80&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.&lt;ref name=Frend82&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; After the Roman legions departed, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native [[Celtic Christianity|British Church]] developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland&lt;ref name=Hindley3&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 3–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr78/&gt; and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of [[Easter]] and the style of the [[tonsure]] haircut that clerics wore.&lt;ref name=Mayr78&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 78–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke115&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' pp. 115–118 discusses the issue of the &quot;Celtic Church&quot; and what exactly it was.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of [[Saint Alban]] and the occurrence in place names of ''eccles'', derived from the Latin ''ecclesia'', meaning &quot;church&quot;.&lt;ref name=Yorke121&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref name=ASE102&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harting32&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures.&lt;ref name=Kirby23&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595.&lt;ref name=ASE104&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Jones &quot;Gregorian Mission&quot; ''Speculum''&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht, who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588,&lt;ref name=ASE105&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps earlier than 560.&lt;ref name=Kirby24&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I, one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]]. As one of the conditions of her marriage, she brought a bishop named [[Liudhard]] with her to Kent.&lt;ref name=DNBBertha&gt;Nelson &quot;Bertha&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times&lt;ref name=Hindley33&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;—possibly the current [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury|St Martin's Church]]. Æthelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.&lt;ref name=DNBBertha/&gt; The historian [[Ian N. Wood]] feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.&lt;ref name=Wood10&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. [[Bede]], an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.{{efn|Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Harting57&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved.&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt; The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the [[Lombards]] who, as pagans and [[Arian]] Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Augustine&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Æthelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having [[imperium]] (overlordship) south of the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the [[language barrier]] between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.&lt;ref name=Brooks7&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.&lt;ref name=Kirby27&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew's]] in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.&lt;ref name=ASE104/&gt; The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King [[Theuderic II]] of [[Burgundy]] and to King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]], as well as their grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhild]], seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King [[Chlothar II]] of [[Neustria]] for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission.&lt;ref name=Brooks4&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.&lt;ref name=Brooks6&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.&lt;ref name=Wood9&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the [[Bible]], so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.&lt;ref name=Fletcher116&gt;Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrival and first efforts ==

Augustine was accompanied by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to the [[archbishop]]ric, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were monks.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt; Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.&lt;ref name=Blair116&gt;Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt; They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival:&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher116&quot; /&gt; Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt; Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion,&lt;ref name=Woods11&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably took place in 597.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt;{{efn|However, Bede's chronology may be a bit off, as he gives the king's death as occurring in February 616, and says the king died 21 years after his conversion, which would date the conversion to 595. This would be before Augustine's mission, and directly contradicts Bede's statement that the king's conversion was due to Augustine's mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby24&quot; /&gt; However, as Gregory in his letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable to effect the conversion of her husband, the problem of the dating is likely a chronological error on Bede's part.&lt;ref name=Kirby28/&gt;}} In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt; Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.{{efn|The letter, as translated in Brooks' ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 8, says &quot;preserve the grace he had received&quot;. ''Grace'' in this context meant the grace of baptism.}} A [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler [[Thomas Elmham]], gives the date of the king's conversion as [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.&lt;ref name=Brooks8&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.&lt;ref name=Kirby28&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Convert56&gt;Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine established his [[episcopal see]] at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of [[Arles]], Gaul (France) after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands.&lt;ref name=Brooks5&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.&lt;ref name=Markus24&gt;Markus &quot;Chronology of the Gregorian Mission&quot; ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 24–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the [[monastery]] of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which later became [[St Augustine's Abbey]],&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; on land donated by the king.&lt;ref name=Blair61&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it, Augustine introduced the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] into England, but there is no evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.&lt;ref name=Monasticism55&gt;Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter Gregory wrote to the [[patriarch of Alexandria]] in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fletcher116/&gt; However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harting32&quot; /&gt; Little literary traces remain of them, however.&lt;ref name=Frend79&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.&lt;ref name=Kirby29&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success, along with questions about the mission.&lt;ref name=ASE106&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''; this section of the ''History'' is usually known as the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]''.&lt;ref name=Laurentius&gt;Lapidge &quot;Laurentius&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bede71/&gt; Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.&lt;ref name=Bede71&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 71–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, and books.{{efn|What happened to these items in later years is unknown. [[Thomas Elmham]], a 15th-century chronicler at Canterbury, gave a number of theories of how most of these objects were lost, including being hidden and never recovered during the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish attacks]] in the 9th and 10th centuries, hidden and lost after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066, or used for the ransom of King [[Richard I of England]] in the 1190s.&lt;ref name=Dodwell10&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving [[St Augustine Gospels]], ([[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] manuscript (MS) 286) which is a 6th-century Italian-illuminated [[Gospel Book]], may be one of the works sent to Augustine. Traditionally, it has been associated with the [[Gregorian mission]].&lt;ref name=Dodwell96&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' pp. 96 and 276 footnote 66&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible survivor is a copy of the ''[[Rule of St Benedict]]'', now MS Oxford [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] Hatton 48.&lt;ref name=Colgrave27&gt;Colgrave &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Earliest Life of Gregory the Great'' pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another possible survival is a Gospel, in an Italian hand, and closely related to the Augustine Gospels, now MS Oxford Bodelian Auctarium D.2.14, which shows evidence of being held in Anglo-Saxon hands during the right time frame. Lastly, a fragment of a work by Gregory the Great, now held by the [[British Library]] as part of MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus C may have arrived with the missionaries.&lt;ref name=Library24&gt;Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;}} The pallium was the symbol of [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to consecrate 12 [[suffragan bishop]]s as soon as possible and to send a bishop to [[York]]. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,&lt;ref name=Brooks9&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the [[kingdom of Essex]], ruled by Æthelberht's nephew [[Saebert of Essex]], who converted to Christianity in 604.&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fletcher453&gt;Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.&lt;ref name=Brooks11&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain. Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, [[Mellitus]] as [[Bishop of London]] and [[Justus]] as [[Bishop of Rochester]].&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE267&gt;Hayward &quot;St Justus&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE305&gt;Lapidge &quot;St Mellitus&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt; Bede relates that Augustine, with the help of the king, &quot;recovered&quot; a church built by Roman Christians in Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Brooks50/&gt;{{efn|The actual Latin is from Chapter 33, Book 1 of Bede, and an online version is [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33 here]. The sentence in question is &quot;AT Augustinus, ubi in regia ciuitate sedem episcopalem, ut praediximus, accepit, recuperauit in ea, regio fultus adminiculo, ecclesiam, quam inibi antiquo Romanorum fidelium opere factam fuisse didicerat, et eam in nomine sancti Saluatoris Dei et Domini nostri Iesu Christi sacrauit, atque ibidem sibi habitationem statuit et cunctis successoribus suis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33|title= Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |accessdate=1 April 2008|work= The Latin Library |publisher=Ad Fontes Academy | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317064020/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml| archivedate= 17 March 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''recuperauit'' could be translated either &quot;repaired&quot; or &quot;recovered&quot;. Sherley-Price translates the sentence as &quot;Having been granted his episcopal see in the royal capital, as already recorded, Augustine proceeded with the king's help to repair a church he was informed had been built long ago by Roman Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the [[Romano-British]] period were uncovered just south of the present [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Brooks50&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the ''Libellus'' points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity.&lt;ref name=Wood170&gt;Wood &quot;Augustine and Aidan&quot; ''L'Église et la Mission'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and [[Dumnonia]] to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,&lt;ref name=Harting70&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 70–72&lt;/ref&gt; apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case.&lt;ref name=Conversion118&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.&lt;ref name=ASE110&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; In 603, Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people,&lt;ref name=Hindley8/&gt; who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,&lt;ref name=Bede100&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 100–103&lt;/ref&gt; they refused to recognise him as their archbishop.&lt;ref name=Hindley8&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harting72/&gt; There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.&lt;ref name=ASE110/&gt; Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.&lt;ref name=Harting72&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.&lt;ref name=Conversion119&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further success ==
Gregory also instructed Augustine on other matters. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,&lt;ref name=Thomson8&gt;Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman [[Pope Sixtus II|St Sixtus]].&lt;ref name=Blair24&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.&lt;ref name=ASE107&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The King's School, Canterbury]] claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1:31887&amp;id=1:31658&amp;id=1:31637 |title=597 and all that: A Brief History of the King's School, Canterbury |accessdate=31 March 2008 |publisher=The King's School, Canterbury |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928010901/http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1%3A31887&amp;id=1%3A31658&amp;id=1%3A31637 |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the [[East Anglia]]n mission.&lt;ref name=Brooks94&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine received [[liturgical book]]s from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form of the [[Latin]] language liturgy in use at Rome.&lt;ref name=Harting173&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:AgCant-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Augustine's gravesite at Canterbury|alt=Pile of stones marked with a tag reading &quot;St. Augustine, Site of Grave, First Archbishop of Canterbury]]
Before his death, Augustine consecrated [[Laurence of Canterbury]] as his successor to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office.&lt;ref name=Hindley43&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the time of Augustine's death, 26 May 604,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.&lt;ref name=ASE110/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins185&gt;Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.&lt;ref name=Harting249&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.&lt;ref name=Harting264&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood8&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair61&quot; /&gt; but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; After the Conquest, his [[shrine]] in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus.&lt;ref name=Nilson67&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry I of England]] granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day [[fair]] around the date on which Augustine's relics were [[Translation (relics)|translated]] to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.&lt;ref name=Shrines&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

A life of Augustine was written by [[Goscelin]] around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light, compared to Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches.&lt;ref name=Gameson17&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful.&lt;ref name=Gameson19&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; These authors included [[William of Malmesbury]], who claimed that Augustine founded [[Cerne Abbey]],&lt;ref name=Gameson20&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the author (generally believed to be [[John Brompton]]) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine,&lt;ref name=Gameson24&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]].&lt;ref name=Gameson22&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 22–31&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and [[Augustine of Hippo]], a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however.&lt;ref name=Blair513&gt;Blair &quot;Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints&quot; ''Local Saints and Local Churches'' p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Reformation]], Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.

Augustine's shrine was re-established in March 2012 at the church of [[Pugin's Church and Shrine of St Augustine|St. Augustine]] in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, very close to the mission's landing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/Home/News-Releases/Pugin-s-Church-becomes-Official-Shrine-of-St-Augustine&lt;!--http://www.rcsouthwark.co.uk/ramsgate_shrine_press_release.pdf--&gt; |title=Pugin's Church becomes Official Shrine of St Augustine|date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |publisher=Catholic Church in England and Wales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200901/http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/Home/News/2012/January-March/Pugin-s-Church-becomes-Official-Shrine-of-St-Augustine|archivedate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Augustine's Cross]], a [[Celtic cross]] erected in 1884, marks the spot in [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet]], [[East Kent]], where Augustine is said to have landed.&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;{{cite web|author=English Heritage |publisher=National Monuments Records |url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=469595&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=st%20augustines%20cross&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |year=2007 |accessdate=15 January 2011 |title=St Augustine's Cross |work=Pastscape |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325002312/http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=469595&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=st%20augustines%20cross&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
