'''Assassination''' is the act of killing a prominent person for either political, religious, or monetary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary &quot;the act of deliberately killing someone especially a public figure, usually for hire or for political reasons&quot; (''Legal Research, Analysis and Writing'' by William H. Putman [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0nlVU6M26AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 215] and [http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive Assassination Policy Under International Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206230433/http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive |date=December 6, 2010 }}, Harvard International Review, May 6, 2006 by Kristen Eichensehr).&lt;/ref&gt;

An assassination may be prompted by religious, political or military [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is an act that may be done for [[contract killing|financial gain]], to [[revenge|avenge]] a [[grievance]], from a desire to acquire [[celebrity|fame]] or [[infamy|notoriety]], or because of a military, security, insurgent or [[secret police]] group's command to carry out the [[homicide]]. Acts of assassination have been performed since [[Ancient history|ancient times]].

{{Main|Hashshashin}}
[[File:Assassination of Nizam al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|260px|left|14th-century painting of the successful assassination of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Seljuq Empire]], by an Assassin.]]
The word ''assassin'' is often believed to derive from the word ''[[hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also hashishin, hashashiyyin, or assassins),&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam&quot;&gt;''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a group of [[Nizari|Nizari Ismailis]] known as [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] who worked against various political targets.

Founded by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], the Assassins were active in the fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in Persia from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and later expanded by capturing forts in Syria. The group killed members of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], and Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] elite for political and religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-84403-416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;C:AH&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=hashishiyya&amp;f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-42494-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of the verb &quot;to assassinate&quot; in printed English was by [[Matthew Sutcliffe]] in ''A Briefe Replie to a Certaine Odious and Slanderous Libel, Lately Published by a Seditious Jesuite'', a pamphlet printed in 1600, five years before it was used in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).&lt;ref&gt;''A briefe replie to a certaine odious and slanderous libel, lately published by a seditious Iesuite.'' Imprinted at London : By Arn. Hatfield, 1600 (STC 23453) p.103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;assassinate, v.&quot; OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2016. Web. August 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient to medieval times===
[[File:Giaele e Sisara.JPG|thumbnail|right|''Jael and Sisera'', by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]].]]
Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

In the [[Old Testament]], King [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was assassinated by his own servants;&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 12:19-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joab]] assassinated [[Absalom]], [[King David]]'s son;&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 3:26-28 RSV&lt;/ref&gt; and King [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 32:21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. His student [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of [[Alexander the Great]]'s generals, [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink = Roger Boesche | first = Roger | last = Boesche |date=January 2003 | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.1boesche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous victims are [[Philip II of Macedon]] (336&amp;nbsp;BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]] (44&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kloWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=famous+assassinations#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Famous assassinations of history&amp;nbsp;... |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010|last1=Johnson|first1=Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim [[Shia Imam]]s hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] king [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]] in 227&amp;nbsp;BC. Whilst many assassinations were performed by individuals or small groups, there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination. The earliest were the [[sicarii]] in 6 AD, who predated the Middle Eastern [[Order of Assassins|assassins]] and Japanese [[shinobi]]s by centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Pichtel, John, ''Terrorism and WMDs: Awareness and Response'', CRC Press (April 25, 2011) p.3-4. {{ISBN|978-1439851753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross&quot;&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian, ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present'', Routledge (January 15, 2011), Chapter: Sicarii. 978-0765620484&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Strangling in the bathtub was the most commonly used method. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the &quot;Curse of King Zvonimir&quot; is based on the legend of his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf |title=FFZG.hr |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was killed by an [[Order of Assassins|assassin]].

The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) were all ended by assassins.

===Modern history===
In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Russian Empire|Russia]] alone, two emperors, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and his grandson [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], were assassinated within 80 years. In the [[United Kingdom]], only one [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] has been [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|assassinated]]—[[Spencer Perceval]] on May 11, 1812.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillen&quot;&gt;M.

In Japan, a group of assassins called the [[Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu]] killed a number of people, including [[Ii Naosuke]] who was the head of administration for the Tokugawa shogunate, during the [[Boshin War]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen.

In the United States, within 100 years, four presidents—[[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]], [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|James A. Garfield]], [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley]] and [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]]—died at the hands of assassins. There have been at least [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts|20 known attempts]] on U.S. presidents' lives. [[Huey Long]], a Senator, was assassinated on September 10, 1935. [[Robert F. Kennedy]], a Senator and a presidential candidate, was also [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on June 6, 1968 in the United States.

In Austria, the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]] in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, carried out by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Serbian national and a member of the [[Serbia]]n nationalist [[Insurgency|insurgents]] ([[Black Hand (Serbia)|The Black Hand]]), is blamed for igniting [[World War I]] after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in [[World War II]] used operatives specifically trained for assassination.

The Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] conducted a regular [[Operation Heads|campaign of assassinations]] against top Nazi German officials in occupied Poland. [[Adolf Hitler]] was almost [[July 20 Plot|killed by his own officers]], and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as [[Operation Foxley]], though this plan was never put into practice).

During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] leader [[Yevhen Konovalets]], [[Ignace Poretsky]], [[Fourth International]] secretary Rudolf Klement, [[Leon Trotsky]], and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) leadership in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman.

India's &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], was [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|shot to death]] on January 30, 1948 by [[Nathuram Godse]].

The African-American civil rights activist, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel (now the [[National Civil Rights Museum]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Three years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, [[Malcolm X]], was assassinated at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] on February 21, 1965. Two years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, [[Medgar Evers]], was assassinated on June 12, 1963. [[Fred Hampton]] of the [[Black Panther Party]] was assassinated on December 4, 1969.

[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], was assassinated by [[Saad Akbar]], a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of Communists and antagonism towards the [[Soviet Union]], were potential reasons for his assassination.

In 1960, [[Inejiro Asanuma]], Chairman of the [[Japan Socialist Party|Japanese Socialist Party]], was assassinated in a stabbing by an extreme rightist.

The U.S. Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]] (the [[Church Committee]]) reported in 1975 that it had found &quot;concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm Church Committee – Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders Part III.B, page 71] from the 'history-matters.com' website.

Most major powers repudiated Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, [[Israel]], the U.S., [[Argentina]], Paraguay, [[Chile]], and other nations accused of engaging in such operations.&lt;ref&gt;John Dingles (2004) The Condor Years {{ISBN|978-1-56584-764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (who survived an assassination attempt himself) ordered the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] air raid on [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2012)|Libya]] in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Gaddafi escaped unharmed; however, his adopted daughter [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)#Casualties|Hanna]] was claimed to be one of the civilian casualties.

In the [[History of the Philippines (1965–1986)#The Fourth Republic (1981–1986)|Philippines]], the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Aquino, a former [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the [[Manila]] [[International Airport]] (now the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]) upon returning home from [[exile]]. His death thrust his widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], into the limelight and, ultimately, the presidency following the peaceful [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]].

After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, the new Islamic government of Iran began an international campaign of assassination that lasted into the 1990s.

Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also advises rulers to assassinate enemies whenever possible so they won't pose a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Machiavelli, Niccolò (1985), The Prince, University of Chicago Press. Translated by Harvey Mansfield&lt;/ref&gt; An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.

For similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.&lt;ref name=&quot;iraja&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503–539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R. Schilling | last2= Schilling | first2=Jonathan L. |doi = 10.1002/polq.12487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will &quot;[[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]&quot; a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:

* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;iraja&quot;/&gt;
* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.
* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as &quot;The Desert Fox&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Skor&quot;&gt;''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:
* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] in order to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and it killed between 6,000 and 41,000 people, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* With the [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|Baghdad International Airport airstrike]] the US assassinated the commander of Iran's [[Quds Force]] General [[Qasem Soleimani]] and the commander of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]] along with 8 other high-ranking military personnel. The assassination of these military leaders was part of [[2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis|escalating tensions between the US and Iran]] and the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|American-led intervention in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Qassem Suleimani: 'Death to America' chants at Baghdad funeral procession | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/huge-crowds-expected-in-baghdad-for-funeral-of-iranian-general-killed-by-us | first=Ghait|last=Abdul-Ahat|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date= January 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iran Says It Has Decided How to React to U.S. Strike That Killed Soleimani | url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/four-rockets-hit-military-base-near-baghdad-airport-report-says-1.8350357 | first=Amos|last=Harel|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date= January 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|Unionist]] politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

==Techniques==

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]
A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austria&quot;&gt;''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' – [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella]. [[BBC]] World Service, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CIA]] made several [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro]], many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed [[cyanide]] ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]].

[[Basic Books]], 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00312-9}} p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 case in the UK concerned the [[Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko|assassination of Alexander Litvinenko]] who was given a lethal dose of radioactive [[polonium]]-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, had been granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after citing persecution in Russia. Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko's death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20082851241951 Putin 'Deplores' Spy Death]'' – [[Sky News]] Friday November 24, 2006 {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or &quot;[[unlawful combatant]]&quot; who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; Note that this is a different term and concept from that of &quot;targeted violence&quot; as used by specialists who study violence.

On the other hand, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The law of armed conflict&amp;nbsp;... – Gary D.

Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people call a targeted killing an &quot;assassination,&quot; they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States&amp;nbsp;... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests&amp;nbsp;... But killings in self-defense are no more &quot;assassinations&quot; in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that &quot;there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing&amp;nbsp;... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.  Assassination&amp;nbsp;... constitutes an illegal killing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QP1Bq7HVQtwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Impact+of+9/11+and+the+New+Legal+Landscape:+The+Day+That+Changed+Everything#v=onepage&amp;q=major%20difference%20between%20assassination%20and%20targeted%20killing&amp;f=false|author=Matthew J.

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, &quot;A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article &quot;By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Yael |title=By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to &quot;Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing&quot; |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120314201721/http%3A//www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860%2Ehtml |website=Carnegie Council |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;&gt;''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' – Fein, Robert A. &amp; Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].

The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[MRAP]]-like [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;/&gt;

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&amp;nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans |access-date=December 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130250/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
