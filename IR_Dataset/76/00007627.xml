'''''The Canterbury Tales''''' ({{lang-enm|Tales of Caunterbury}}{{refn|The name &quot;Tales of Caunterbury&quot; appears within the surviving texts of Chaucer's work. Its modern name first appeared as {{lang|enm|Canterbury talys}} in [[John Lydgate]]'s 1421–1422 prologue to the ''Siege of Thebes''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, David. &quot;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cr/summary/v038/38.3carlson.html The Chronology of Lydgate's Chaucer References]&quot;.

Accessed 6 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in [[Middle English]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] between 1387 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Canterbury-Tales Encyclopedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1386, Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and, in 1389, Clerk of the King's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval People: Vivid Lives in a Distant Landscape|last = Prestwich|first = Michael|publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0500252031 |location = London|pages = 4. An Age of Plague 1300–1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The tales (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], although some are in [[prose]]) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of [[pilgrim]]s as they travel together from London to [[Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at Southwark on their return.

After a long list of works written earlier in his career, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372.

It has been suggested that the greatest contribution of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to [[English literature]] was the popularisation of the English [[vernacular]] in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], [[the Pearl Poet]], and [[Julian of Norwich]]—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.

While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.

''The Canterbury Tales'' is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the [[General Prologue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400) &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (in middle english and modern english)|url = http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm|website = www.librarius.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, ''The Canterbury Tales'' is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = Black|first = Joseph|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Canada|pages = 229–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four [[incunabula]] (printed before c 1540) editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the ''Tales''' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearsall, 8&quot;&gt;Pearsall, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure.

Even the oldest surviving manuscripts of the ''Tales'' are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called &quot;[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]&quot;), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. Another famous example is the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]], a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 10, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to be published in print was [[William Caxton]]'s 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the [[British Library]] and one held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]].

In 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney (2006), &quot;Chaucer's Scribe,&quot; ''Speculum'', '''81''' : 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/20/highereducation.books] Ezard, John (20 July 2004). &quot;The scrivener's tale: how Chaucer's sloppy copyist was unmasked after 600 years&quot;. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship has cast severe doubt upon that identification.&lt;ref&gt;See overview in the Wiki 'Adam Pinkhurst' page, citing especially Lawrence Warner, ''Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384–1432'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order===
{{Main|Order of The Canterbury Tales|List of The Canterbury Tales characters}}
In the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the ''Tales'' exists, there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.&lt;ref name = seven&gt;Cooper, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Textual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales. Some scholarly editions divide the ''Tales'' into ten &quot;Fragments&quot;. The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).&lt;ref name = seven/&gt; Victorians frequently used the nine &quot;Groups&quot;, which was the order used by [[Walter William Skeat]] whose edition ''Chaucer: Complete Works'' was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now{{when|date=March 2018}} seldom followed.&lt;ref name = seven/&gt;

An alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing ''The Canterbury Tales'', the early-fifteenth century [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI. Fragments I and II almost always follow each other, just as VI and VII, IX and X do in the oldest manuscripts. Fragments IV and V, by contrast, vary in location from manuscript to manuscript.

Chaucer wrote in a London dialect of late Middle English, which has clear differences from Modern English. From philological research, some facts are known about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced ''-e'' at the end of many words, so that ''care'' was {{IPA-enm|ˈkaːrə|}}, not {{IPAc-en|k|ɛər}} as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word ''knight'' was {{IPA|[kniçt]}}, with both the ''k'' and the ''gh'' pronounced, not {{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|t}}. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] had not yet happened. For instance, the long ''e'' in ''wepyng'' &quot;weeping&quot; was pronounced as {{IPA-enm|eː|}}, as in modern German or Italian, not as {{IPAc-en|iː}}.

Although no manuscript exists in Chaucer's own hand, two were copied around the time of his death by [[Adam Pinkhurst]], a scribe with whom he may have worked closely before, giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the ''Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney, &quot;Chaucer’s Scribe&quot;, ''Speculum'', 81 (2006), 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the final ''-e'' sound was lost soon after Chaucer's time, scribes did not accurately copy it, and this gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ian Robinson, ''Chaucer's Prosody: A Study of the Middle English Verse Tradition'' (London: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; It has now been established, however, that ''-e'' was an important part of Chaucer's grammar, and helped to distinguish singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative.&lt;ref&gt;Seminal studies included M. L. Samuels, &quot;Chaucerian Final '-e'&quot;, ''Notes and Queries'', 19 (1972), 445–48, and D. Burnley, &quot;Inflection in Chaucer's Adjectives&quot;, ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 83 (1982), 169–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

No other work prior to Chaucer's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage. It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of ''The Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen &quot;master of ceremonies&quot; to guide them and organise the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the &quot;pilgrim&quot; figures of Dante and Virgil in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harold Bloom&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Road Trip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer's ''The Canterbury Tales''|journal=Speculum|date=2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630–60|doi=10.1086/692620|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/44079043/692620.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to ''The Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Death]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''The Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he may have merely read the ''Decameron'' at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by [[Ovid]], the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as the works of [[John Gower]] do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard]]'s ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brewer227&quot;&gt;Brewer, p. 227. &quot;Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brewer277&quot;&gt;Brewer, p. 277.&quot;...where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose-writers: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these, Petrarch.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendrickson183-192&quot;&gt;Hendrickson, pp. 183–92. Professor G. L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rearden, p. 458. &quot;There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.&quot; &quot;...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skeat (1874), p. xxx. &quot;And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and structure==
[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west [[circa|c.]] 1890–1900 (retouched from a black &amp; white photograph)]]

''The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or [[frame tale]], a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differs from most other story &quot;collections&quot; in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though &quot;the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales&quot;, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into &quot;majestic persuades&quot;, &quot;temperate pleases&quot;, and &quot;subdued teaches&quot;. Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.&lt;ref name=&quot;empathy article&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-canterbury-tales-geoffrey-chaucer/|title=Puppetry and the &quot;Popet:&quot; Fiction, Reality, and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Thus Chaucer's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a &quot;lady&quot;, while the lower classes use the word &quot;wenche&quot;, with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word &quot;pitee&quot;, for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context and themes==
[[File:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]]

''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Western Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of [[indulgences]], which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the [[Sacrament of Confession]]) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''Tales''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to [[Kent]] to get away from events in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some readers look to interpret the characters of ''The Canterbury Tales'' as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Howard, ''Chaucer and the Medieval World'' (London, 1987), pp. 410–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 49–51, 56–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church &quot;indulgences&quot; for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Friar's Tale]], one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]
Churchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 73–75, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 91–95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Prioress's Tale]] is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] that became a part of English literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt; The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html &quot;The Prioress's Tale&quot;], by Prof. Jane Zatta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 99–02.&lt;/ref&gt; but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 110–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 117–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class and convention===
[[File:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|[[Bors]]' Dilemma – he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]

The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 123–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. [[The Knight's Tale]] shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 139–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Two tales, ''[[Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry—the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being &quot;those who pray&quot; (the clergy), &quot;those who fight&quot; (the nobility), and &quot;those who work&quot; (the commoners and peasantry).&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some &quot;quit&quot; (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition &quot;the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.&quot;&lt;ref name=opp&gt;Cooper, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Several works of the time contained the same opposition.&lt;ref name=opp/&gt;

===Relativism versus realism===
Chaucer's characters each express different—sometimes vastly different—views of reality, creating an atmosphere of [[Playspace|testing]], [[empathy]], and [[relativism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;empathy article&quot; /&gt; As [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]] says, &quot;Different genres give different readings of the world: the [[fabliau]] scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.&quot; The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liminality===
The concept of [[liminality]] figures prominently within ''The Canterbury Tales''.&lt;ref name=&quot;empathy article&quot; /&gt; A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a “real” (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Norma J. &quot;Liminal Space in Travellers’ Tales: Historical and Fictional Passages (Folklore, Ritual, History).” Order No. 8615152 The Pennsylvania State University, 1986. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 30 Sep. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in ''The Canterbury Tales'',

{{Quote
|Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.&lt;ref&gt;Jost, Jean. &quot;Urban and Liminal Space in Chaucer's Knight's Tale: Perilous or Protective?&quot; Albrecht Classen, ed. ''Fundamentals of Medieval and Early Modern Culture: Urban Space in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Age''. Berlin, DEU: Walter de Gruyter, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Liminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the [[The Friar's Tale|Friar’s Tale]] in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Morton W. &quot;The 'Friar's Tale' as a Liminal Tale&quot;. ''The Chaucer Review'' 17.4 (1983): 286–91. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Franklin's Tale|Franklin’s Tale]] is a [[Breton lai|Breton Lai]] tale, which takes the tale into a liminal space by invoking not only the interaction of the supernatural and the mortal, but also the relation between the present and the imagined past.&lt;ref&gt;Nowlin,  Steele. &quot;Between Precedent and Possibility: Liminality, Historicity, and Narrative in Chaucer's 'The Franklin's Tale'.&quot; ''Studies in Philology'' 103.1 (2006): 47–67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on literature==
It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] English, rather than French or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as ''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]'', which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Reception==
[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]
[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]

While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' is believed to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate]]'s religious and historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 295–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th century===
John Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''The Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with &quot;sentence&quot; and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 298–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary additions and supplements==
The incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, Stephanie, ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p. 86. {{ISBN|0-8166-3823-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[Bérinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 86–88, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lydgate wrote ''The Siege of Thebes'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the ''Tales''. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]], and several editions for centuries after followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 88–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Charlotte, ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 8–9. {{ISBN|0-521-34250-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlgren, Thomas, ''Medieval Outlaws'', Parlor Press, 2005, pp. 264–65. {{ISBN|1-932559-62-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary adaptations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

Many literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage. Science-fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] titled ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.

[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.

Historical-mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.

Canadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.

==Adaptations and homages==
''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot;, was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath’s Tale, The Pardoner’s Tale and The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a musical [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] that was first staged in 1964.

''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Steve, ''Chaucer at Large'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 64–65. {{ISBN|0-8166-3376-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;Pencak, William, ''The Films of Derek Jarman'', Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Co, 2002, pp. 178–9. {{ISBN|0-7864-1430-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 1986, American radio personality [[Garrison Keillor]] opened &quot;The News from Lake Wobegon&quot; portion of the first live TV broadcast of his ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue.  He commented, &quot;Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring.&quot;

Television adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: ''[[Trinity Tales]]''. In 2003, the BBC again featured [[The Canterbury Tales (TV series)|modern re-tellings of selected tales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=Canterbury Tales |accessdate=6 May 2007 |publisher=BBC Drama}}&lt;/ref&gt;
