The '''galjoen''', '''black bream''', or '''blackfish''' (''Dichistius capensis'') is a species of marine [[fish]] found only along the  coast of southern Africa from [[Angola]] to [[South Africa]].  
Galjoen is the [[National animal|national fish]] of South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lill2004&quot;/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Galjoen at Rocky Bay DSC00471.JPG|thumb|left|Galjoen at Rocky Bay]]
The galjoen is indigenous to the coasts of southern Africa from [[Angola]] to [[South Africa]], and is generally found around [[reefs]] at shallow depths around {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}, often near the shore.

==Description==
This species can reach {{convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[fish measurement|total length]] and a weight of {{convert|6.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The body is compressed, and the fins are well developed, with prominent spines,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lill2004&quot;/&gt;  10 of them, with between 18 and 23 rays. The anal fin has three spines, and usually 13 or 14 rays, the pelvic fins have 1 spine and 5 rays, and the pectoral fins are typically shorter than the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heemstra2004&quot;/&gt; The body, fins, and head, with the except of the front of the snout, are covered in scales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heemstra2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Heemstra|first=Phillip C.|title=Coastal Fishes of Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4H1uWszXOQC&amp;pg=PA248|date=January 2004|publisher=NISC (PTY) LTD|isbn=978-1-920033-01-9|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lips are thick, with strong curved incisors at the front of the mouth, with smaller teeth behind the front incisors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heemstra2004&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==

===Diet===
The species usually feeds on red and coraline seaweed and red bait, small [[mussels]] and [[barnacle]]s found off rocky shores,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lill2004&quot;/&gt; and appear in particular to be partial to the white mussels residing in the sandy beaches and inlets of the rocky outcrops along the southern coast.

===Home area===
In 2005, the movements of the species were extensively studied. Some 25,000 galjoen were tagged at four sites in reserves in South Africa and it was concluded that their overall movement remained localised, with some 95% of fish studied seeming to indicate a home area.&lt;ref name=&quot;CadrinKerr2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadrin|first1=Steven X.|last2=Kerr|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Mariani|first3=Stefano|title=Stock Identification Methods: Applications in Fishery Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYZqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388|date=4 October 2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-397258-3|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance to humans==

===Fishing===
It is important to local [[commercial fisheries]] and is also popular as a [[game fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase |genus= Dichistius|species= capensis| month = April | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As food===
Due to their abundance in the shores off South Africa, galjoen is common in [[South African cuisine]]. A notable dish is the fish is sprinkled with pepper and lemon, or with lemon, mayonnaise and melted garlic butter and served with fresh bread and apricot jam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paarman2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Paarman|first=Ina|title=West Coast Cookbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CTWMa8eWTgC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2003|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-86872-846-6|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As the national fish of South Africa===
Galjoen is the national fish of South Africa.  The suggestion to make it the national fish came from Margaret Smith, wife of the ichthyologist [[J. L. B. Smith]], to find a marine equivalent to the [[Springbok]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lill2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lill|first=Dawid Van|title=Van Lill's South African Miscellany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5whRwm1o3wC&amp;pg=PT51|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Zebra|isbn=978-1-86872-921-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The scientific name of ''Coracinus capensis'' is a reference to its black colour when found in rocky areas, ''Coracinus'' meaning &quot;raven&quot; or &quot;black coloured&quot;; in sandy areas it gives off a silver-bronze colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lill2004&quot;/&gt;
