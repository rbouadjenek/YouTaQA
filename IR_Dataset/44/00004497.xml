[[File:Ettore Bugatti in 1932.jpg|thumb|upright=1.17|Ettore Bugatti, 1932]]
'''Automobiles Ettore Bugatti''' was a French&lt;!-- please do not change this without seeking consensus first, see talk page --&gt; car [[automotive industry|manufacturer]] of [[high performance vehicle|high-performance automobiles]], founded in 1909 in the then-[[German Empire|German]] city of [[Molsheim]], [[Alsace]] by the Italian-born industrial designer [[Ettore Bugatti]]. The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories. Famous Bugattis include the [[Bugatti Type 35|Type 35 Grand Prix]] cars, the [[Bugatti Royale|Type 41 &quot;Royale&quot;]], the [[Bugatti Type 57|Type 57 &quot;Atlantic&quot;]] and the [[Bugatti Type 55|Type 55]] sports car.

The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the [[marque]], and the death of his son [[Jean Bugatti]] in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963. In the 1990s, an Italian entrepreneur revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive [[sports car]]s. Today, the name is owned by the [[Volkswagen Group]].

==Under Ettore Bugatti==
Founder Ettore Bugatti was born in [[Milan]], Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in Molsheim located in the Alsace region which was part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1919. The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic manner in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), was an important [[Art Nouveau]] furniture and jewelry designer).

===World War I and its aftermath===
[[File:Bugatti Typ 13 Brescia Sport-Racing 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bugatti Type 13 Brescia Sport-Racing, 1922]]
During the [[First World War|war]] Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later to Paris, but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1920&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=René Bellu |title=Automobilia|journal=Toutes les voitures françaises 1920 (salon [Oct] 1919)|volume=Nr. 31|pages=63|year=2004|publisher=Histoire &amp; collections|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than four months after the [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)|Versailles Treaty]] formalised the transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the [[Paris Motor Show|15th Paris motor show]] in October 1919.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1920/&gt; He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely based on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same [[ohc|overhead camshaft]] 4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1920/&gt; Smallest of the three was a &quot;[[Bugatti Type 13|Type 13]]&quot; with a racing body (constructed by Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with a {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1920/&gt; The others were a &quot;[[Bugatti Type 13#Type 22|Type 22]]&quot; and a &quot;[[Bugatti Type 13#Type 23|Type 23]]&quot; with wheelbases of {{convert|2250|and|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1920/&gt;

===Racing successes===
[[File:Bugatti Type 35.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bugatti Type 35B]]
{{Main|Bugatti Grand Prix results}}
The company also enjoyed great success in early [[Grand Prix motor racing]]: in 1929 a privately entered [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35B|Bugatti]] won the first ever [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. Racing success culminated with driver [[Jean-Pierre Wimille]] winning the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] twice (in 1937 with [[Robert Benoist]] and 1939 with [[Pierre Veyron]]).

Bugatti cars were extremely successful in racing. The little [[Bugatti Type 10]] swept the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 [[Bugatti Type 35]] is one of the most successful racing cars. The Type 35 was developed by Bugatti with master engineer and racing driver [[Jean Chassagne]] who also drove it in the car's first ever Grand Prix in 1924 Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;L’Automobiliste, 1971 P. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Bugattis swept to victory in the [[Targa Florio]] for five years straight from 1925 through 1929. [[Louis Chiron]] held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the modern marque revival Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. named the 1999 [[Bugatti 18/3 Chiron]] concept car in his honour. But it was the final racing success at Le Mans that is most remembered—Jean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron won the 1939 race with just one car and meagre resources.

===Aeroplane racing===
[[File:Bugatti 100 Racing Plane @ Oshkosh (2234509290) (2).jpg|thumb|Bugatti 100P Racing Plane]]
In the 1930s, Ettore Bugatti got involved in the creation of a racer [[airplane]], hoping to beat the Germans in the [[Deutsch de la Meurthe prize]]. This would be the [[Bugatti Model 100|Bugatti 100P]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airventuremuseum.org/collection/aircraft/Bugatti%20Model%20100%20Racer.asp#TopOfPage|title=Bugatti Model 100 at the EAA Museum|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bugattiaircraft.com/plane.htm |title=Bugatti Aircraft Association – 100P Airplane |publisher=Bugattiaircraft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which never flew. It was designed by Belgian engineer [[Louis de Monge]] who had already applied Bugatti Brescia engines in his &quot;Type 7.5&quot; lifting body.

===Railcar===
[[File:Hugh llewelyn ZZy 24408 (5729560683).jpg|thumb|Bugatti Railcar]]
Ettore Bugatti also designed a successful motorised railcar, the ''[[:fr:Autorail Bugatti|Autorail Bugatti]]'' ([https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAutorail_Bugatti Autorail Bugatti]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Streamlined Auto-Rail Car Used in France|magazine=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA885|date=December 1934|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family tragedy===
The death of Ettore Bugatti's son, [[Jean Bugatti]], on 11 August 1939 marked a turning point in the company's fortunes. Jean died while testing a [[Bugatti Type 57#Type 57S Tank|Type 57 tank-bodied race car]] near the Molsheim factory.

==After World War II==
[[File:Bugatti Coach Type 73A (1947) pic1.JPG|thumb|Bugatti Type 73A]]
[[World War II]] left the Molsheim factory in ruins and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois, a northwestern suburb of Paris. After the war, Bugatti designed and planned to build a series of new cars, including the Type 73 road car and Type 73C single seat racing car, but in all Bugatti built only five Type 73 cars.

Development of a 375&amp;nbsp;cc supercharged car was stopped when Ettore Bugatti died on 21 August 1947. Following Ettore Bugatti's death, the business declined further and made its last appearance as a business in its own right at a [[Paris Motor Show]] in October 1952.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1953&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=René Bellu |title=Automobilia |journal=Toutes les voitures françaises 1953 (salon Paris oct 1952) |volume=Nr. 14 |pages=Pages 6 &amp; 10|year=2000|publisher=Histoire &amp; collections|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long decline, the original incarnation of Bugatti ceased operations in 1952.

==Design==
[[File:Fondation Bugatti-Molsheim-Moteur Type 49 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bugatti Type 49 Engine ([[Musée de la Chartreuse, Molsheim]])]]
Bugattis are noticeably focused on design. [[Engine block]]s were [[hand scraper|hand scraped]] to ensure that the surfaces were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured ''[[guilloché]]'' (engine turned) finishes on them, and safety wires had been threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the [[axle]]s as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed through a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor [[Bentley]]'s cars as &quot;the world's fastest lorries&quot; for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, &quot;weight was the enemy&quot;.

===Notable finds in the modern era===
Relatives of Harold Carr found a rare 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante when cataloguing the doctor's belongings after his death in 2009. Carr's Type 57S is notable because it was originally owned by British race car driver Earl Howe. Because much of the car's original equipment is intact, it can be restored without relying on replacement parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/02/1937-bugatti-atalante-sup_n_154743.html |title=1937 Bugatti Atalante Supercar, One of 17, Found in English Garage, Associated Press, January 2, 2009 |work=The Huffington Post |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2009, a 1925 Bugatti Brescia Type 22 which had lain at the bottom of [[Lake Maggiore]] on the border of Switzerland and Italy for 75 years was recovered from the lake. The Mullin Museum in [[Oxnard, California]] bought it at auction for $351,343 at Bonham's [[Rétromobile]] sale in Paris in 2010.

==Attempts at revival==
The company attempted a comeback under Roland Bugatti in the mid-1950s with the [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[Bugatti Type 251|Type 251]] race car. Designed with help from [[Gioacchino Colombo]], the car failed to perform to expectations and the company's attempts at automobile production were halted.

In the 1960s, [[Virgil Exner]] designed a Bugatti as part of his &quot;[[Exner Revival Cars|Revival Cars]]&quot; project. A show version of this car was actually built by [[Ghia]] using the last [[Bugatti Type 101]] chassis, and was shown at the 1965 [[Turin Motor Show]]. Finance was not forthcoming, and Exner then turned his attention to a revival of [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]].

Bugatti continued manufacturing airplane parts and was sold to [[Hispano-Suiza]], also a former auto maker turned aircraft supplier, in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt; [[Snecma]] took over Hispano-Suiza in 1968. After acquiring [[Messier-Bugatti-Dowty|Messier]], Snecma merged Messier and Bugatti into Messier-Bugatti in 1977.

[[File:2007-06-15 18 Bugatti EB 110 (bearb - kl).jpg|thumb|[[Bugatti EB110]] (1996)]]
Italian entrepreneur [[Romano Artioli]] acquired the Bugatti brand in 1987, and established '''Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.'''. Artioli commissioned architect Giampaolo Benedini to design the factory which was built in [[Campogalliano]], Modena, Italy. Construction of the plant began in 1988, alongside the development of the first model, and it was inaugurated two years later—in 1990.{{sfnp|AISA|2011|p=28}}

By 1989, the plans for the new Bugatti revival were presented by Paolo Stanzani and [[Marcello Gandini]], designers of the [[Lamborghini Miura]] and [[Lamborghini Countach]]. The first production vehicle was the [[Bugatti EB110|Bugatti EB110 GT]]. It used a [[carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer]] chassis, a 3.5-litre, 5-valve per cylinder, quad-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 60° [[V12 engine]], a six-speed [[gearbox]], and [[four-wheel drive]].

Famed racing car designer [[Mauro Forghieri]] served as Bugatti's technical director from 1992 through 1994.

On 27 August 1993, through his holding company, ACBN Holdings S.A. of [[Luxembourg]], Romano Artioli purchased [[Lotus Cars]] from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]. Plans were made to list Bugatti shares on international stock exchanges.

Bugatti presented a prototype large saloon called the [[Bugatti EB 112|EB112]] in 1993.

Perhaps the most famous Bugatti EB110 owner was seven-time [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One World Champion]] racing driver [[Michael Schumacher]] who purchased an EB110 in 1994. Schumacher sold his EB110, which had been repaired after a severe 1994 crash, to Modena Motorsport, a Ferrari service and race preparation garage in Germany.

By the time the EB110 came to market, the North American and European economies were in recession. Poor economic conditions forced the company to fail and operations ceased in September 1995. A model specific to the US market called the &quot;Bugatti America&quot; was in the preparatory stages when the company ceased operations.

Bugatti's liquidators sold Lotus Cars to [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]] of Malaysia. German firm [[Dauer Racing]] purchased the EB110 licence and remaining parts stock in 1997 in order to produce five more EB110 SS vehicles. These five SS versions of the EB110 were greatly refined by Dauer. The Campogalliano factory was sold to a furniture-making company, which became defunct prior to moving in, leaving the building unoccupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Copyright. Est February 2003. |url=http://www.trade-247.com/80.html |title=Bugatti on TradeTwentyfourSeven website |publisher=Trade-247.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dauer stopped producing cars in 2011, Toscana-Motors GmbH of Germany purchased the remaining parts stock from Dauer.

The EB118 concept featured a {{convert|408|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|adj=on}}, W-18 engine. After its Paris debut, the EB118 concept was shown again in 1999 at the [[Geneva Auto Show]] and the [[Tokyo Motor Show]]. Bugatti introduced its next concepts, the [[Bugatti EB218|EB 218]] at the 1999 [[Geneva Motor Show]] and the [[Bugatti 18/3 Chiron|18/3 Chiron]] at the 1999 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA).
