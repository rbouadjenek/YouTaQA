'''Transportation in Canada''', the world's second-largest country in total area, is dedicated to having an efficient, high-capacity multimodal [[transport]] spanning often vast distances between [[Geography of Canada|natural resource extraction sites]], [[Agriculture in Canada|agricultural]] and [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|urban areas]]. [[Canada]]'s transportation system includes more than {{convert|1400000|km}} of roads, 10 major international airports, 300 smaller airports, {{convert|72093|km|abbr=on}} of functioning railway track, and more than 300 commercial ports and harbours that provide access to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] oceans as well as the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www41.statcan.ca/2007/4006/ceb4006_000_e.htm |title=Transportation in Canada |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=2008-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410162502/http://www41.statcan.ca/2007/4006/ceb4006_000_e.htm |archivedate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the transportation sector made up 4.2% of Canada's GDP, compared to 3.7% for Canada's mining and oil and gas extraction industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trans Sector 05&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/11-621-MIE/11-621-MIE2006044.pdf |title= An Analysis of the Transportation Sector in 2005| publisher= Statistics Canada| accessdate=2008-03-27|format= PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409105655/http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/11-621-MIE/11-621-MIE2006044.pdf |archivedate = 2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transport Canada]] oversees and regulates most aspects of transportation within federal jurisdiction, including interprovincial transport. This primarily includes rail, air and maritime transportation. Transport Canada is under the direction of the federal government's [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|Minister of Transport]]. The [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]] is responsible for maintaining transportation safety in Canada by investigating accidents and making safety recommendations.

[[Image:Transca chwk.jpg|right|thumb|The Trans-Canada highway in Chilliwack, BC]]

There is a total of {{convert|1042300|km|abbr=on}} of roads in Canada, of which {{convert|415600|km|abbr=on}} are paved, including {{convert|17000|km|abbr=on}} of expressways (the third-longest collection in the world, behind the [[Interstate Highway System]] of the United States and the China's [[Expressways of China|National Trunk Highway System]]). As of 2008, {{convert|626700|km|abbr=on}} were unpaved.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |accessdate=2011-01-13 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, there were 20,706,616 road vehicles registered in Canada, of which 96% were vehicles under {{convert|4.5|t|lk=on}}, 2.4% were vehicles between {{convert|4.5|and|15|t}} and 1.6% were {{convert|15|t}} or greater. These vehicles travelled a total of 333.29 billion kilometres, of which 303.6 billion was for vehicles under 4.5 tonnes, 8.3 billion was for vehicles between 4.5 and 15 tonnes and 21.4 billion was for vehicles over 15 tonnes. For the 4.5- to 15-tonne trucks, 88.9% of vehicle-kilometres were intra-province trips, 4.9% were inter-province, 2.8% were between Canada and the [[United States|US]] and 3.4% made outside of Canada. For the trucks over 15 tonnes, 59.1% of vehicle-kilometres were intra-province trips, 20% inter-province trips, 13.8% Canada-US trips and 7.1% trips made outside of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/53-223-x/53-223-x2009000-eng.pdf |title=Canadian Vehicle Survey: Annual |publisher=Statistics Canada |year=2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's vehicles consumed a total of {{convert|31.4|e6m3|Moilbbl|lk=out}} of [[gasoline]] and {{convert|9.91|e6m3|Moilbbl}} of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan&quot;/&gt; Trucking generated 35% of the total [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] from transport, compared to 25% for rail, water and air combined (the remainder being generated by the industry's transit, pipeline, scenic and support activities).&lt;ref name=&quot;Trans Sector 05&quot;/&gt; Hence roads are the dominant means of passenger and freight transport in Canada.

Roads and highways were managed by provincial and municipal authorities until construction of the Northwest Highway System (the [[Alaska Highway]]) and the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] project initiation. The Alaska Highway of 1942 was constructed during [[World War II]] for military purposes connecting [[Fort St. John, British Columbia]] with [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Year&quot;/&gt; The transcontinental highway, a joint national and provincial expenditure, was begun in 1949 under the initiation of the Trans Canada Highway Act on December 10, 1949. The {{convert|7821|km|adj=on}} highway was completed in 1962 at a total expenditure of $1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Coneghan | first =Daria | title =Trans-Canada Highway | work =The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan | publisher =Canadian Plains Research Center, University of Regina | year =2006 | url =http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/trans-canada_highway.html | accessdate =2007-12-29 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}

Internationally, Canada has road links with both the [[Contiguous United States|lower 48]] US states and [[Alaska]]. The [[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|Ministry of Transportation]] maintains the road network in [[Ontario]] and also employs Ministry of Transport Enforcement Officers for the purpose of administering the Canada Transportation Act and related regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/contact/regional_e.html |title=Regional Enforcement Officers |accessdate=2007-10-01 |author=Canadian Transportation Agency |publisher=Canadian Transportation Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2004/09/21/c2149.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html |title=Enforcement blitz improves road safety |accessdate=2007-10-01 |author=Ministry of Transportation |publisher=Canada NewsWire |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215145409/http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2004/09/21/c2149.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html |archivedate=15 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Transportation (New Brunswick)|Department of Transportation]] in [[New Brunswick]] performs a similar task in that [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] as well.

The safety of Canada's roads is moderately good by international standards, and is improving both in terms of accidents per head of population and per billion [[vehicle kilometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraptranstats.net/ca |title=Transport in Canada |accessdate=2008-10-06 |work=International Transport Statistics Database |publisher=[[International Road Assessment Program|iRAP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a year are usually earned about $11 billion, of which 3.2% is from passengers and the rest from freight. The [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] are Canada's two major freight railway companies, each having operations throughout [[North America]]. In 2007, 357 billion tonne-kilometres of freight were transported by rail, and 4.33 million passengers travelled 1.44 billion passenger-kilometres (an almost negligible amount compared to the 491 billion passenger-kilometres made in light road vehicles). 34,281 people were employed by the rail industry in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Railway carriers, operating statistics | publisher = Statistics Canada | url = http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad46a.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080223200711/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad46a.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationwide passenger services are provided by the [[Crown corporations of Canada|federal crown corporation]] [[Via Rail]]. Three Canadian cities have [[commuter rail]] services: in the [[Montreal]] area by [[Agence métropolitaine de transport|AMT]], in the [[Toronto]] area by [[GO Transit]], and in the [[Vancouver]] area by [[West Coast Express]].

Most Canadian cities have [[public transport]], if only a [[bus]] system. Three Canadian cities have [[rapid transit]] systems, four have [[light rail]] systems, and three have [[commuter rail]] systems (see below). In 2016, 12.4% of Canadians used public transportation to get to work. This compares to 79.5% that got to work using a car (67.4% driving alone, 12.1% as part of a carpool), 5.5% that walked and 1.4% that rode a bike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171129/dq171129c-eng.htm|title=Journey to work: Key results from the 2016 Census|last=|first=|date=2017-11-29|publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government organizations across Canada owned 17,852 buses of various types in 2016. Organizations in Ontario (38.8%) and Quebec (21.9%) accounted for just over three-fifths of the country's total bus fleet. Urban municipalities owned more than 85% of all buses.[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/181127/dq181127c-eng.htm]

in 2016, diesel buses were the leading bus type in Canada (65.9%), followed by bio-diesel (18.1%) and hybrid (9.4%) buses. Electric, natural gas and other buses collectively accounted for the remaining 6.6%.[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/181127/dq181127c-eng.htm]

==History==
The standard history covers the French regime, fur traders, the canals, and early roads, and gives extensive attention to the railways.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. de T. Glazebrook, ''A history of transportation in Canada'' (1938; reprinted 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

===European contact===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] walked. They also used  [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[umiak]]s and [[Bull Boat]]s, in addition to the [[snowshoe]], [[toboggan]] and [[sled]] in winter. They had no wheeled vehicles, and no animals larger than dogs.

Europeans adopted canoes as they pushed deeper into the continent's interior, and were thus able to travel via the waterways that fed from the [[St. Lawrence River]] and [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/ Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century and early 20th century transportation relied on harnessing oxen to ''[[Red River ox cart]]s'' or horse to wagon. Maritime transportation was via manual labour such as canoe or wind on sail. Water or land travel speeds was approximately {{convert|8|to|15|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeoOfTrans&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Rodrigue | first = Dr. Jean-Paul | title = Historical Geography of Transportation - Part I | work = Dept. of Economics &amp; Geography | publisher = Hofstra University | date = 1998–2008 | url =http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html | accessdate = 2008-01-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112113050/http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement was along river routes. Agricultural commodities were perishable, and trade centres were within {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. Rural areas centred around villages, and they were approximately {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} apart. The advent of [[Steam locomotive|steam railways]] and [[Steamboat|steamships]] connected resources and markets of vast distances in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeoOfTrans&quot;/&gt; Railways also connected city centres, in such a way that the traveller went by sleeper, railway hotel, to the cities. Crossing the country by train took four or five days, as it still does by car. People generally lived within {{convert|5|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the [[downtown]] core thus the train could be used for inter-city travel and the [[tram]] for commuting.

The advent of the interstate or Trans-Canada Highway in Canada in 1963 established ribbon development, truck stops, and industrial corridors along throughways.

The Federal Department of Transport (established 2 November 1936) supervised railways, canals, harbours, marine and shipping, civil aviation, radio and meteorology. The Transportation Act of 1938 and the amended Railway Act, placed control and regulation of carriers in the hands of the Board of Transport commissioners for Canada. The Royal Commission on Transportation was formed 29 December 1948, to examine transportation services to all areas of Canada to eliminate economic or geographic disadvantages. The Commission also reviewed the Railway Act to provide uniform yet competitive freight-rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year&quot;/&gt;
