[[File:3-Tasten-Maus Microsoft.jpg|thumb|A computer mouse with the most common features: two buttons (left and right) and a scroll wheel (which also functions as a button).]]
A '''computer mouse''' (plural '''mice '''or '''mouses''') is a hand-held [[pointing device]] that detects [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a [[Pointer (user interface)|pointer]] on a [[Computer monitor|display]], which allows a smooth control of the [[graphical user interface]] of a [[computer]].

The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968. Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts. Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system. 

In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more [[mouse button|buttons]] to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and [[scroll wheel]]s, which enable additional control and dimensional input.

== Naming ==
The earliest known publication of the term ''mouse'' as referring to a computer pointing device is in [[Bill English (computer engineer)|Bill English's]] July 1965 publication, &quot;Computer-Aided Display Control&quot; likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a [[mouse]], a [[rodent]], with the cord resembling its [[tail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;mouse&quot;, sense 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardini1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Bardini |author-first=Thierry |title=Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing |date=2000 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location=Stanford |isbn=978-0-80473871-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bootstrapping00thie/page/98 98] |url=https://archive.org/details/bootstrapping00thie|url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BillEnglish&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=English |author-first1=William K. |author-last2=Engelbart |author-first2=Douglas C. |author-last3=Huddart |author-first3=Bonnie |title=Computer-Aided Display Control |date=July 1965 |publisher=[[Stanford Research Institute]] |location=Menlo Park |page=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914/page/n59 6] |url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914 |access-date=2017-01-03 |format=Final Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plural for the small rodent is always &quot;mice&quot; in modern usage. The plural of a computer mouse is either &quot;mouses&quot; or &quot;mice&quot; according to most dictionaries, with &quot;mice&quot; being more common.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxdic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mouse |title=Definition for Mouse |date=2011 |access-date=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded plural usage is &quot;mice&quot;;  the online ''Oxford Dictionaries'' cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include [[J. C. R. Licklider]]'s &quot;The Computer as a Communication Device&quot; of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memex.org/licklider.pdf |title=The Computer as a Communication Device |author-first=J. C. R. |author-last=Licklider |work=Science and Technology |date=April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term computer mouses may be used informally in some cases. Although the plural of a mouse (small rodent) is mice, the two words have undergone a differentiation through usage.

The [[trackball]], a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by [[Ralph Benjamin]] as part of a post-[[World War II]]-era [[Fire-control system|fire-control]] [[radar]] plotting system called [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS). Benjamin was then working for the British [[Royal Navy]] Scientific Service. Benjamin's project used [[analog computer]]s to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a [[joystick]]. Benjamin felt that a more elegant [[input device]] was needed and invented what they called a &quot;roller ball&quot; for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Copping_2013_Benjamin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill_2005_Benjamin&quot;/&gt;

The device was patented in 1947,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill_2005_Benjamin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=RALPH BENJAMIN: An Interview Conducted by Peter C. J. Hill |editor-first=Peter C.

Another early trackball was built by [[Kenyon Taylor]], a British [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff. Taylor was part of the original [[Ferranti Canada]], working on the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]'s [[DATAR]] (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vardalas_1994_DATAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/85.279228 |title=From DATAR to the FP-6000: Technological change in a Canadian industrial context |date=1994 |author-last=Vardalas |author-first=J. |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=20–30 |url=http://ewh.ieee.org/reg/7/millennium/fp6000/fp6000_datar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display. The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined. A [[Computer#Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits|digital computer]] calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using [[pulse-code modulation]] radio signals. This trackball used a standard Canadian [[five-pin bowling]] ball. It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CrzgS5SoMzcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:%22Pioneers+in+Canadian+Electrical+Manufacturing%22#PPA228,M1 |title=Ferranti-Packard: Pioneers in Canadian Electrical Manufacturing |author-first1=Norman R. |author-last1=Ball |author-first2=John N. |author-last2=Vardalas |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's Press]] |date=1993|isbn=9780773509832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieee.ca/millennium/fp6000/fp6000_datar.html |title=FP-6000 -- From DATAR To The FP-6000 |work=ieee.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to &quot;augment&quot; human intelligence. That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in [[Reno, Nevada]], Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the [[planimeter]] to X-Y coordinate input.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardini2&quot;/&gt; On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a &quot;bug,&quot; which in a &quot;3-point&quot; form could have a &quot;drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardini2&quot;/&gt; He wrote that the &quot;bug&quot; would be &quot;easier&quot; and &quot;more natural&quot; to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be &quot;much better for coordination with the keyboard.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardini2&quot;/&gt;

In 1964, [[Bill English (computer engineer)|Bill English]] joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardini1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137400/2008/12/mouse40.html |title=The computer mouse turns 40 |work=[[Macworld]] |author-first=Benj |author-last=Edwards |date=2008-12-09 |access-date=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They christened the device the ''mouse'' as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common [[mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/languages/english-usage/51-mouses-vs-mice-Usage-disputes-alt-usage-english.html |title=&quot;Mouses&quot; vs &quot;mice&quot; |work=The Ultimate Learn And Resource Center |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, this &quot;mouse&quot; was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardini1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BillEnglish&quot;/&gt; On 9 December 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].

Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System ([[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]) exploited different body movements –&amp;nbsp;for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose&amp;nbsp;– but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author-last=Engelbart |author-first=Douglas C. |title=Display-Selection Techniques for Text Manipulation |publisher=IEEE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics |pages=5–15 |date=March 1967 |url=http://dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-133184.html |access-date=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one [[Coordinate system|axis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-133184.html |title=Display-Selection Techniques for Text Manipulation - 1967 (AUGMENT, 133184) - Doug Engelbart Institute |author-last=Engelbart |author-first=Christina |website=dougengelbart.org |access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the &quot;Mother of All Demos&quot;, Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.

On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named ''{{lang|de|Rollkugel}}'' (German for &quot;rolling ball&quot;) was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company [[Telefunken]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bülow_2009_Rollkugel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Auf-den-Spuren-der-deutschen-Computermaus--/meldung/136901 |author-first=Ralf |author-last=Bulow |title=Auf den Spuren der deutschen Computermaus |trans-title=In the footsteps of the German computer mouse |language=German |publisher=[[Heise Verlag]] |date=2009-04-28 |access-date=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball. It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named ''{{lang|de|[[Rollkugel (trackball device)|Rollkugel]]}}'') that was embedded into radar flight control desks. This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken {{lang|de|Konstanz}} for the German ''Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung (Federal Air Traffic Control)'' as part of their TR&amp;nbsp;86 process computer system with its SIG&amp;nbsp;100-86&lt;ref name=&quot;Bülow_2009_Rollkugel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SIG-100 video terminal and mouse |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/input-output/14/346/1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; vector graphics terminal.

Some 1968 illustrations show a device without a central button. Also, it is not clear that a mouse was made in 1968, only ones from 1972 exist. --&gt; for the ''TR 86'' computer system]]

When the development for the Telefunken main frame {{Interlanguage link multi|Telefunken TR 440|de|3=TR 440|lt=TR 440}} began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of &quot;reversing&quot; the existing {{lang|de|Rollkugel}} into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device. Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968. Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the {{lang|de|[[Leibniz-Rechenzentrum]]}} in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bülow_2009_Rollkugel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OldMouse_Telefunken&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmouse.com/mouse/misc/telefunken.shtml |title=Telefunken's 'Rollkugel' |publisher=oldmouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.

The [[Xerox Alto]] was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACM Turing Award Goes to Creator of First Modern Personal Computer |url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/turing-award-09 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |access-date=2011-01-11 |author-first=Virginia |author-last=Gold |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311223801/http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/turing-award-09 |archive-date=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Palo Alto Research Center|PARC]]'s Alto, the [[Lilith (computer)|Lilith]], a computer which had been developed by a team around {{lang|de|[[Niklaus Wirth]]}} at [[ETH Zürich]] between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well. The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the [[Xerox Star|Xerox 8010 Star]] in 1981.

By 1982, the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse. The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming [[Apple Lisa]] was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold [[Laboratory mouse|lab mice]].

== Operation ==
{{further|Point and click}}
A mouse typically controls the motion of a [[Pointer (user interface)|pointer]] in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.

The relative movements of the mouse on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so hand movements are replicated by the pointer.&lt;ref name=&quot;dummies&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-your-computer-mouse.html |title=How to Use Your Computer Mouse |publisher=[[For dummies|dummies.com]] |access-date=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clicking or hovering (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called &quot;icons&quot; and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window.

Different ways of operating the mouse cause specific things to happen in the GUI:&lt;ref name=&quot;dummies&quot;/&gt;
* Click: pressing and releasing a button.
** (left) [[Point and click|Single-click]]: clicking the main button.
** (left) [[Double-click]]: clicking the button two times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than two separate single clicks.
** (left) [[Triple-click]]: clicking the button three times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than three separate single clicks. Triple clicks are far less common in traditional navigation.
** [[Right-click]]: clicking the secondary button, or clicking with two fingers. (This brings a menu with different options depending on the software)
** Middle-click: clicking the tertiary button.
* [[Drag and drop]]: pressing and holding a button, then moving the mouse without releasing. (Using the command &quot;[[Right-drag|drag with the right mouse button]]&quot; instead of just &quot;drag&quot; when one instructs a user to drag an object while holding the right mouse button down instead of the more commonly used left mouse button.)
* [[Mouse chording|Mouse button chording]] (a.k.a. Rocker navigation).
** Combination of right-click then left-click.
** Combination of left-click then right-click or keyboard letter.
** Combination of left or right-click and the mouse wheel.
* Clicking while holding down a [[modifier key]].
* Moving the pointer a long distance: When a practical limit of mouse movement is reached, one lifts up the mouse, brings it to the opposite edge of the working area while it is held above the surface, and then replaces it down onto the working surface. This is often not necessary, because acceleration software detects fast movement, and moves the pointer significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion.
* Multi-touch: this method is similar to a multi-touch trackpad on a laptop with support for tap input for multiple fingers, the most famous example being the [[Apple Magic Mouse]].

=== Gestures ===
{{Main|Pointing device gesture}}
Users can also employ mice ''gesturally''; meaning that a stylized motion of the mouse cursor itself, called a &quot;[[Pointing device gesture|gesture]]&quot;, can issue a command or map to a specific action. For example, in a drawing program, moving the mouse in a rapid &quot;x&quot; motion over a shape might delete the shape.

Gestural interfaces occur more rarely than plain pointing-and-clicking; and people often find them more difficult to use, because they require finer motor control from the user. However, a few gestural conventions have become widespread, including the [[drag and drop]] gesture, in which:

# The user presses the mouse button while the mouse cursor hovers over an interface object
# The user moves the cursor to a different location while holding the button down
# The user releases the mouse button

For example, a user might drag-and-drop a picture representing a file onto a picture of a [[Trash (computing)|trash can]], thus instructing the system to delete the file.

Standard semantic gestures include:
* [[Crossing-based interface|Crossing-based goal]]
* [[Drag and drop]]
* [[Menu (computing)|Menu]] traversal
* Pointing
* [[Rollover (web design)|Rollover]] ([[Mouseover]])
* [[Selection (user interface)|Selection]]

=== Specific uses ===
Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains. In interactive [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional graphics]], the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation. For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's &quot;head&quot; faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head. A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined. 3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.

When mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a [[Handedness|right-handed]] configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the [[Mozilla]] web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new [[Tab (GUI)|tab]] or [[window (computing)|window]] in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.

The German company [[Telefunken]] published on their early ball mouse on 2 October 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bülow_2009_Rollkugel&quot;/&gt; Telefunken's mouse was sold as optional equipment for their computer systems. [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], builder of Engelbart's original mouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/features/mouse/mouse.html |title=Doug Engelbart: Father of the Mouse (interview) |access-date=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a ball mouse in 1972 while working for [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Wadlow |author-first=Thomas A. |title=The Xerox Alto Computer |journal=[[BYTE]] |date=September 1981 |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=58–68 |url=&lt;!-- http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/thexeroxaltocomputer --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball mouse replaced the external wheels with a single ball that could rotate in any direction. It came as part of the hardware package of the [[Xerox Alto]] computer. Perpendicular [[Optical chopper|chopper wheels]] housed inside the mouse's body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors, thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted [[trackball]] and became the predominant form used with [[personal computer]]s throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.

[[File:Logitechms48.jpg|thumb|left|Mechanical mouse, shown with the top cover removed. The scroll wheel is gray, to the right of the ball.]]

The ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers. These are located 90 degrees apart. One roller detects the forward–backward motion of the mouse and other the left–right motion. Opposite the two rollers is a third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the same shaft as an [[Incremental encoder|encoder]] wheel that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement. Each wheel's disc has a pair of light beams, located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes.

Simple logic circuits interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating. This [[Incremental encoder|incremental rotary encoder]] scheme is sometimes called quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately [[quadrature phase]]. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable, directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen.

The ball is mostly steel, with a precision spherical rubber surface. The weight of the ball, given an appropriate working surface under the mouse, provides a reliable grip so the mouse's movement is transmitted accurately. Ball mice and wheel mice were manufactured for Xerox by Jack Hawley, doing business as The Mouse House in Berkeley, California, starting in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawley&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.stanford.edu/mac/primary/images/hawley1.html |title=The Xerox Mouse Commercialized |work=Making the Macintosh: Technology and Culture in Silicon Valley |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721013847/http://library.stanford.edu/mac/primary/images/hawley1.html |archivedate=2010-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmouse.com/mouse/hawley/ |title=Hawley Mark II X063X Mouses |work=oldmouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on another invention by Jack Hawley, proprietor of the Mouse House, [[Honeywell]] produced another type of mechanical mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Engineering_Graphics/_EG2001/mouse/improvements.html#honeywell |title=Honeywell mechanical mouse |access-date=2007-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428032201/http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Engineering_Graphics/_EG2001/mouse/improvements.html#honeywell &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4628755.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4628755&amp;RS=PN/4628755 |title=Honeywell mouse patent |access-date=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a ball, it had two wheels rotating at off axes. [[Key Tronic]] later produced a similar product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keytronic.com/home/products/specs/2hw73-1es.htm |title=Keytronic 2HW73-1ES Mouse |access-date=2007-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927092356/http://www.keytronic.com/home/products/specs/2hw73-1es.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern computer mice took form at the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL) under the inspiration of Professor [[Jean-Daniel Nicoud]] and at the hands of [[engineer]] and [[watchmaker]] [[André Guignard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Of-Mice-and-Men-and-PCs-43129.shtml |title=Of Mice and Men... and PCs|publisher=News.softpedia.com |date=1970-11-17 |access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new design incorporated a single hard rubber mouseball and three buttons, and remained a common design until the mainstream adoption of the scroll-wheel mouse during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2004/explorers/interactive/profiles/computer.mouse/content.html |title=Inventions, computer mouse – the CNN site |access-date=2006-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424150438/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2004/explorers/interactive/profiles/computer.mouse/content.html |archive-date=2005-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[René Sommer]] added a [[microprocessor]] to Nicoud's and Guignard's design.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrs&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer mouse inventor dies in Vaud |url=http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/wrsnews/computer-mouse-inventor-dies-in-vaud.shtml?16283 |work=[[World Radio Switzerland]] |date=2009-10-14 |access-date=2009-10-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707010602/http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/wrsnews/computer-mouse-inventor-dies-in-vaud.shtml?16283 |archive-date=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this innovation, Sommer is credited with inventing a significant component of the mouse, which made it more &quot;intelligent&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;wrs&quot;/&gt; though optical mice from [[Mouse Systems]] had incorporated microprocessors by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |title=People |author-first=Denise |author-last=Caruso |volume=6 |issue=20 |publisher=[[InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.]] |page=16 |issn=0199-6649 |date=1984-05-14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of mechanical mouse, the &quot;analog mouse&quot; (now generally regarded as obsolete), uses [[potentiometer]]s rather than encoder wheels, and is typically designed to be [[plug compatible]] with an analog joystick. The &quot;Color Mouse&quot;, originally marketed by [[RadioShack]] for their [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] (but also usable on [[MS-DOS]] machines equipped with analog joystick ports, provided the software accepted joystick input) was the best-known example.

=== Optical and laser mice ===
[[File:HP Mouse M-U0031-O-1681.jpg|thumb|The underside of an optical mouse.]]
{{Main|Optical mouse}}

Optical mice rely entirely on one or more [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and an imaging array of [[photodiode]]s to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics. A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.

The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone. Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces. Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.

=== Inertial and gyroscopic mice ===
Often called &quot;air mice&quot; since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other [[accelerometer]] (US Patent 4787051&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4787051.html|title=Inertial mouse system|website=Free Patents Online|access-date=2018-03-23|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported. The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation. The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or &quot;[[gorilla arm]]&quot;.

Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased [[Usability|ease-of-use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshpatents.com/Highly-sensitive-inertial-mouse-dt20060727ptan20060164393.php |title=Highly Sensitive Inertial Mouse |website=Fresh Patents |access-date=2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.

=== 3D mice ===
{{redirect|SpaceBall|other uses|Spaceball (disambiguation)}}
Also known as bats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=3D user interfaces |author-first1=Doug A. |author-last1=Bowman |author-first2=Ernst |author-last2=Kruijff |author-first3=Ivan |author-last3=Poupyrev |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-201-75867-2 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=It5QAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; flying mice, or wands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring advanced manufacturing technologies |author-first1=Stephen F. |author-last1=Krar |author-first2=Arthur |author-last2=Gill |publisher=[[Industrial Press, Inc.]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8311-3150-0 |pages=8–6–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkfsC77pdwC&amp;pg=PT247}}&lt;/ref&gt; these devices generally function through [[ultrasound]] and provide at least three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. Probably the best known example would be [[3Dconnexion]] (&quot;[[Logitech]]'s SpaceMouse&quot;) from the early 1990s. In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse. This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons. The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kantek Fingers a Better Mouse|url=http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec17/art6.htm |website=Byte.com |access-date=2010-05-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224094906/http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec17/art6.htm |archive-date=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.

One example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the [[Wii Remote]]. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the [[Infrared|IR]] emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the [[Wii Nunchuk|nunchuk]] accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the [[PlayStation Move]], the [[Razer Hydra]] and the controllers part of the [[HTC Vive]] virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrlogic.com/html/3dconnexion/space_ball.html |title=Space Ball |publisher=Vrlogic.com |access-date=2010-05-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716145206/http://www.vrlogic.com/html/3dconnexion/space_ball.html |archive-date=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped. With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each. In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse. This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axsotic.de |title=axsotic |publisher=axsotic.de |access-date=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tactile mice ===
In 2000, [[Logitech]] introduced a &quot;tactile mouse&quot; that contained a small [[actuator]] to make the mouse vibrate. Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with [[Haptic technology|haptic]] feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a [[Window (computing)|window]] boundary. To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Heckner |author-first1=T. |author-first2=C. |author-last2=Kessler |author-first3=S. |author-last3=Egersdörfer |author-first4=G. J. |author-last4=Monkman |title=Computer based platform for tactile actuator analysis |location=Actuator'06, Bremen |date=14–16 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never marketed.

=== Pucks ===
[[Graphics tablet|Tablet digitizers]] are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/41409/digitizer-tablet |title=''Digitizer tablet'' Definition |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |access-date=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ergonomic mice ===
[[File:Delux M618 vertical mouse.jpg|thumb|A vertical mouse]]
As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[arthritis]] and other [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive strain injuries]]. It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.

When holding a typical mouse, [[ulna]] and [[radius (bone)|radius]] bones on the [[arm]] are crossed. Some designs attempt to place the palm more vertically, so the bones take more natural parallel position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evoluent.com/vm4r.htm |title=Evoluent VerticalMouse Vertical Mouse ergonomic mouse ergonomic computer mouse carpal tunnel syndrome repetitive stress disorder RSI |work=evoluent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some limit wrist movement, encouraging arm movement instead, that may be less precise but more optimal from the health point of view. A mouse may be angled from the thumb downward to the opposite side – this is known to reduce wrist pronation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ergocanada.com/detailed_specification_pages/hippus_nv_handshoe_mouse_original.html |title=Handshoe Mouse (Original) |author=Product Specialists |work=ergocanada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However such optimizations make the mouse right or left hand specific, making more problematic to change the tired hand. [[Time magazine]] has criticized manufacturers for offering few or no left-handed ergonomic mice: &quot;Oftentimes I felt like I was dealing with someone who’d never actually met a left-handed person before.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confessions of a Left-Handed Technology User&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author-last=McCracken |author-first=Harry |title=Confessions of a Left-Handed Technology User |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/08/27/left-handed-technology/ |website=Time |access-date=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roller bar mouse.JPG|thumb|Keyboard with roller bar mouse]]

Another solution is a pointing bar device. The so-called ''roller bar mouse'' is positioned snugly in front of the keyboard, thus allowing bi-manual accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;Study at [[Wichita State University]]: ''&quot;Examining First-Time Usage of the RollerMouse&quot;'' [http://usabilitynews.org/examining-first-time-usage-of-the-rollermouse/], of 2003-12-08, uploaded 2014-07-11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gaming mice ===
These mice are specifically designed for use in [[PC game|computer games]]. They typically employ a wide array of controls and buttons and have designs that differ radically from traditional mice. They may also have decorative monochrome or programmable RGB LED lighting. The additional buttons can often be used for changing the sensitivity of the mouse or they can be assigned to macros (i.e., for opening a program or for use instead of a key combination) It is also common for gaming mice, especially those designed for use in [[real-time strategy]] games such as ''[[StarCraft]]'', or in [[multiplayer online battle arena]] games such as ''[[Dota 2]]'' to have a relatively high sensitivity, measured in [[dots per inch]] (DPI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-au/help/windows-8/how-to/mouse/change-mouse-sensitivity |title=Windows 8 How-to: Mice |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=Microsoft Hardware}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advanced mice from gaming manufacturers also allow users to customize the weight of the mouse by adding or subtracting weights to allow for easier control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://superuser.com/questions/192648/proper-use-and-purpose-of-mouse-weights |title=Proper use and purpose of mouse weights |publisher=Super User |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ergonomic quality is also an important factor in gaming mice, as extended gameplay times may render further use of the mouse to be uncomfortable. Some mice have been designed to have adjustable features such as removable and/or elongated palm rests, horizontally adjustable thumb rests and pinky rests. Some mice may include several different rests with their products to ensure comfort for a wider range of target consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyborggaming.com/prod/rat9.htm |title=Mad Catz R.A.T. 9 Product Page |access-date=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaming mice are held by [[gamer]]s in three styles of [[wikt:grip|grip]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/2013/07/11/peripheral-vision-logitech-g600-mmo-gaming-mouse |title=Peripheral Vision: Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse |access-date=2013-08-09 |website=GameZone |author-first=Thomas |author-last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalstormonline.com/unlocked/pc-gaming-101-mouse-grip-styles-idnum28/ |title=PC Gaming 101: Mouse Grip Styles |website=[[Digital Storm Online, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connectivity and communication protocols ==
[[File:MS-Arc-Mouse.jpg|thumb|A Microsoft wireless [[Arc Mouse]], marketed as &quot;travel-friendly&quot; and foldable but otherwise operated exactly like other 3-button wheel-based optical mice]]
To transmit their input, typical cabled mice use a thin electrical cord terminating in a standard connector, such as [[RS-232]]C, [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]], [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. Cordless mice instead transmit data via [[infrared]] radiation (see [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]) or [[radio]] (including [[Bluetooth]]), although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.

While the electrical interface and the format of the data transmitted by commonly available mice is currently standardized on USB, in the past it varied between different manufacturers. A [[bus mouse]] used a dedicated interface card for connection to an [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] or compatible computer.

Mouse use in DOS applications became more common after the introduction of the [[Microsoft Mouse]], largely because Microsoft provided an open standard for communication between applications and mouse driver software. Thus, any application written to use the Microsoft standard could use a mouse with a driver that implements the same API, even if the mouse hardware itself was incompatible with Microsoft's. This driver provides the state of the buttons and the distance the mouse has moved in units that its documentation calls &quot;[[#Mouse speed|mickeys]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;int33h&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/c/programming-bbrown/advcw3.htm#mouse |title=Interfacing to mouse.sys |accessdate=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819232148/http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/c/programming-bbrown/advcw3.htm#mouse |archivedate=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[Allegro (software)|Allegro library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allegro_mouse_routines&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author-last=Hargreaves |author-first=Shawn |author-link=:pl:Shawn Hargreaves |display-authors=et al|url= http://alleg.sourceforge.net/latestdocs/en/alleg004.html |title=Allegro manual: Mouse routines |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120415123653/http://alleg.sourceforge.net/latestdocs/en/alleg004.html |archive-date=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, there were earlier mice, such as on the Sun workstation and even the original Microsoft &quot;green-eyed&quot; mouse.  If you want to write them up... --&gt;

=== Early mice ===
[[File:Computer Museum of America (02).jpg|right|thumb|Xerox Alto mouse]]

In the 1970s, the [[Xerox Alto]] mouse, and in the 1980s the Xerox [[optical mouse]], used a [[Rotary encoder#Incremental rotary encoder|quadrature-encoded]] X and Y interface.  This two-bit encoding per dimension had the property that only one bit of the two would change at a time, like a [[Gray code]] or [[Johnson counter]], so that the transitions would not be misinterpreted when asynchronously sampled.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Lyon (1981), [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/VLSI-81-1_The_Optical_Mouse.pdf &quot;The Optical Mouse, and an Architectural Methodology for Smart Digital Sensors&quot;], Xerox PARC report.  &quot;The counters needed for X and Y simply count through four states, in either direction (up or down), changing only one bit at a time (i.e., 00, 01, 11, 10). This is a simple case of either a Gray-code counter or a Johnson counter (Moebius counter).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mass-market mice, such as on the [[Apple mouse#Models|original Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]] mice used a [[D-subminiature]] 9-pin connector to send the quadrature-encoded X and Y axis signals directly, plus one pin per mouse button.  The mouse was a simple optomechanical device, and the decoding circuitry was all in the main computer.

The [[DE-9 connector]]s were designed to be electrically compatible with the [[Joystick#Electronic games|joysticks]] popular on numerous 8-bit systems, such as the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[Atari 2600]].  Although the ports could be used for both purposes, the signals must be interpreted differently.  As a result, plugging a mouse into a joystick port causes the &quot;joystick&quot; to continuously move in some direction, even if the mouse stays still, whereas plugging a joystick into a mouse port causes the &quot;mouse&quot; to only be able to move a single pixel in each direction.

=== Serial interface and protocol ===
[[File:Mouse quadrature encoding Lyon 1980.png|thumb|Signals XA and XB &quot;in quadrature&quot; convey X-direction motion, while YA and YB convey Y-dimension motion; here the pointer (cursor) is shown drawing a small curve.]]

Because the IBM PC did not have a [[quadrature decoder]] built in, early PC mice used the [[RS-232]]C serial port to communicate encoded mouse movements, as well as provide power to the mouse's circuits. The [[Mouse Systems|Mouse Systems Corporation]] version used a five-byte protocol and supported three buttons. The Microsoft version used a three-byte protocol and supported two buttons. Due to the incompatibility between the two protocols, some manufacturers sold serial mice with a mode switch: &quot;PC&quot; for MSC mode, &quot;MS&quot; for Microsoft mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedos-32.sourceforge.net/showdoc.php?page=sermouse FreeDOS-32&amp;nbsp;– Serial Mouse driver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302000300/http://freedos-32.sourceforge.net/showdoc.php?page=sermouse |date=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apple Desktop Bus ===
[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpg|thumb|[[Macintosh Plus|Apple Macintosh Plus]] mice: beige mouse (left), platinum mouse (right), 1986]]

In 1986 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] first implemented the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] allowing the daisy-chaining (linking together in series, ie. end to end) of up to 16 devices, including mice and other devices on the same bus with no configuration whatsoever. Featuring only a single data pin, the bus used a purely polled approach to computer/device communications and survived as the standard on mainstream models (including a number of non-Apple workstations) until 1998 when Apple's [[iMac]] line of computers joined the industry-wide switch to using [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. Beginning with the Bronze Keyboard PowerBook G3 in May 1999, Apple dropped the external ADB port in favor of USB, but retained an internal ADB connection in the [[PowerBook G4]] for communication with its built-in keyboard and trackpad until early 2005.

=== PS/2 interface and protocol ===
{{details|PS/2 connector}}
[[Image:ps-2-ports.jpg|thumb|right|Color-coded PS/2 connection ports; purple for keyboard and green for mouse]]
With the arrival of the [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] personal-computer series in 1987, IBM introduced the [[eponym]]ous PS/2 interface for mice and keyboards, which other manufacturers rapidly adopted. The most visible change was the use of a round 6-pin [[mini-DIN connector|mini-DIN]], in lieu of the former 5-pin MIDI style full sized [[DIN 41524]] connector. In default mode (called ''stream mode'') a PS/2 mouse communicates motion, and the state of each button, by means of 3-byte packets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Adam |author-last=Chapweske |url=http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2mouse/ |title=Computer Engineering Tips – PS/2 Mouse Interface |publisher=Computer-engineering.org |date=2003-04-01 |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any motion, button press or button release event, a PS/2 mouse sends, over a bi-directional serial port, a sequence of three bytes, with the following format:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- align=center
!||Bit 7||Bit 6||Bit 5||Bit 4||Bit 3||Bit 2||Bit 1||Bit 0
|- align=center
!Byte 1
|YV||XV||YS||XS||1||MB||RB||LB
|- style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
!Byte 2
|colspan=&quot;8&quot;|X movement
|- style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
!Byte 3
|colspan=&quot;8&quot;|Y movement
|}

Here, XS and YS represent the sign bits of the movement vectors, XV and YV indicate an overflow in the respective vector component, and LB, MB and RB indicate the status of the left, middle and right [[mouse button]]s (1 = pressed). PS/2 mice also understand several commands for reset and self-test, switching between different operating modes, and changing the resolution of the reported motion vectors.

A [[IntelliMouse|Microsoft IntelliMouse]] relies on an extension of the PS/2 protocol: the ImPS/2 or IMPS/2 protocol (the abbreviation combines the concepts of &quot;IntelliMouse&quot; and &quot;PS/2&quot;). It initially operates in standard PS/2 format, for backwards compatibility. After the host sends a special command sequence, it switches to an extended format in which a fourth byte carries information about wheel movements. The IntelliMouse Explorer works analogously, with the difference that its 4-byte packets also allow for two additional buttons (for a total of five).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/mcompat.mspx Retrieved 31 December 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408164755/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/mcompat.mspx |date=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouse vendors also use other extended formats, often without providing public documentation. The Typhoon mouse uses 6-byte packets which can appear as a sequence of two standard 3-byte packets, such that an ordinary PS/2 [[device driver|driver]] can handle them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keyboard scancodes: The PS/2 Mouse|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-13.html |publisher=Win.tue.nl |access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 3-D (or 6-degree-of-freedom) input, vendors have made many extensions both to the hardware and to software. In the late 1990s, Logitech created ultrasound based tracking which gave 3D input to a few millimeters accuracy, which worked well as an input device but failed as a profitable product. In 2008, Motion4U introduced its &quot;OptiBurst&quot; system using IR tracking for use as a Maya (graphics software) plugin.

=== USB ===
The industry-standard [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] (Universal Serial Bus) protocol and its connector have become widely used for mice; it is among the most popular types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 2007 |title=USB: A Technological Success Story |author-first=Jon |author-last=Gan |journal=HWM |issn=0219-5607 |publisher=SPH Magazines |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MesDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cordless or wireless ===
Cordless or wireless mice transmit data via [[infrared]] radiation (see [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]) or [[radio]] (including [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]]). The receiver is connected to the computer through a serial or USB port, or can be built in (as is sometimes the case with Bluetooth and WiFi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.targus.com/us/productdetail.aspx?regionId=7&amp;sku=AMW58US&amp;PageName=Mice%20for%20Laptops%20by%20Targus&amp;productCategoryId=20&amp;bucketTypeId=0&amp;searchedTerms=&amp;navlevel1=products&amp;cp=&amp;bannertxt=Mice%20for%20Laptops |title=Targus |work=targus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Modern non-Bluetooth and non-WiFi wireless mice use USB receivers. Some of these can be stored inside the mouse for safe transport while not in use, while other, newer mice use newer &quot;[[List of wireless mice with nano receivers|nano]]&quot; receivers, designed to be small enough to remain plugged into a laptop during transport, while still being large enough to easily remove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Lisa |author-last=Johnston |url=http://peripherals.about.com/od/glossaryofpcterms/g/WhatIsANanoReceiver.htm |title=What Is a Nano Wireless Receiver? |access-date=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Multiple-mouse systems ==
Some systems allow two or more mice to be used at once as input devices. Late-1980s era [[home computer]]s such as the [[Amiga]] used this to allow computer games with two players interacting on the same computer ([[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]] and [[The Settlers]] for example). The same idea is sometimes used in [[collaborative software]], e.g. to simulate a [[whiteboard]] that multiple users can draw on without passing a single mouse around.

[[Microsoft Windows]], since [[Windows 98]], has supported multiple simultaneous pointing devices. Because Windows only provides a single screen cursor, using more than one device at the same time requires cooperation of users or applications designed for multiple input devices.

Multiple mice are often used in multi-user gaming in addition to specially designed devices that provide several input interfaces.

Windows also has full support for multiple input/mouse configurations for multi-user environments.

Starting with Windows XP, Microsoft introduced a SDK for developing applications that allow multiple input devices to be used at the same time with independent cursors and independent input points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/multipoint/mouse-sdk/developer.aspx |title=Multipoint Mouse SDK |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |access-date=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of Vista and Microsoft Surface (now known as [[Microsoft PixelSense]]) introduced a new set of input APIs that were adopted into Windows 7, allowing for 50 points/cursors, all controlled by independent users. The new input points provide traditional mouse input; however, they were designed with other input technologies like touch and image in mind. They inherently offer 3D coordinates along with pressure, size, tilt, angle, mask, and even an image bitmap to see and recognize the input point/object on the screen.

As of 2009, [[Linux]] distributions and other [[operating system]]s that use [[X.Org Server|X.Org]], such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[FreeBSD]], support 255 cursors/input points through [[Multi-Pointer X]]. However, currently no window managers support Multi-Pointer X leaving it relegated to custom software usage.

There have also been propositions of having a single operator use two mice simultaneously as a more sophisticated means of controlling various graphics and multimedia applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author-last1=Nakamura |author-first1=S. |author-last2=Tsukamoto |author-first2=M. |author-last3=Nishio |author-first3=S. |date=26–28 August 2001 |title=Design and implementation of the double mouse system for a Window environment |conference=IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing |publisher=IEEE |volume=1 |pages=204–207 |doi=10.1109/PACRIM.2001.953558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buttons ==
{{Main|Mouse button}}

[[File:Razer Naga 2014 MMO Gaming Mouse (14714867599).jpg|thumb|Mouse with additional buttons.]]
Mouse buttons are [[Miniature snap-action switch|microswitches]] which can be pressed to select or interact with an element of a [[graphical user interface]], producing a distinctive clicking sound.

Since around the late 1990s, the three-button scrollmouse has become the de facto standard. Users most commonly employ the second button to invoke a [[context menu|contextual menu]] in the computer's software user interface, which contains options specifically tailored to the interface element over which the mouse cursor currently sits. By default, the primary mouse button sits located on the left-hand side of the mouse, for the benefit of right-handed users; left-handed users can usually reverse this configuration via software.

== Scrolling ==
{{Main|Scroll wheel}}

Nearly all mice now have an integrated input primarily intended for [[scrolling]] on top, usually a single-axis digital wheel or rocker switch which can also be depressed to act as a third button. Though less common, many mice instead have two-axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel, [[trackball]], or [[touchpad]].

== Speed ==
Mickeys per second is a unit of measurement for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse,&lt;ref name=&quot;int33h&quot;/&gt; where direction is often expressed as &quot;horizontal&quot; versus &quot;vertical&quot; mickey count. However, speed can also refer to the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves on the screen and how far the mouse moves on the mouse pad, which may be expressed as [[pixels]] per mickey, [[pixels]] per [[inch]], or pixels per [[centimeter]].

The computer industry often measures mouse sensitivity in terms of counts per inch (CPI), commonly expressed as dots per inch (DPI){{spaced ndash}}the number of steps the mouse will report when it moves one inch. In early mice, this specification was called pulses per inch (ppi).&lt;ref name=&quot;hawley&quot;/&gt; The Mickey originally referred to one of these counts, or one resolvable step of motion. If the default mouse-tracking condition involves moving the cursor by one screen-pixel or dot on-screen per reported step, then the CPI does equate to DPI: dots of cursor motion per inch of mouse motion. The CPI or DPI as reported by manufacturers depends on how they make the mouse; the higher the CPI, the faster the cursor moves with mouse movement. However, software can adjust the mouse sensitivity, making the cursor move faster or slower than its CPI. {{As of|2007|alt=Current}} software can change the speed of the cursor dynamically, taking into account the mouse's absolute speed and the movement from the last stop-point. In most software, an example being the Windows platforms, this setting is named &quot;speed,&quot; referring to &quot;cursor precision&quot;. However, some operating systems name this setting &quot;acceleration&quot;, the typical Apple OS designation. This term is incorrect. Mouse acceleration in most mouse software refers to the change in speed of the cursor over time while the mouse movement is constant.

For simple software, when the mouse starts to move, the software will count the number of &quot;counts&quot; or &quot;mickeys&quot; received from the mouse and will move the cursor across the screen by that number of pixels (or multiplied by a rate factor, typically less than 1). The cursor will move slowly on the screen, with good precision. When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for some threshold, the software will start to move the cursor faster, with a greater rate factor. Usually, the user can set the value of the second rate factor by changing the &quot;acceleration&quot; setting.

Operating systems sometimes apply acceleration, referred to as &quot;[[ballistics]]&quot;, to the motion reported by the mouse. For example, versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] prior to [[Windows XP]] doubled reported values above a configurable threshold, and then optionally doubled them again above a second configurable threshold. These doublings applied separately in the X and Y directions, resulting in very [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pointer ballistics for Windows XP |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pointer-bal.mspx |work=Windows Hardware Developer Center Archive |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2002 |access-date=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mousepads ==
{{Main|Mousepad}}

Engelbart's original mouse did not require a mousepad;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gruntville.com/reviews/mousepads/corepad_roundup/index.php |title=Corepad Victory &amp; Deskpad XXXL |author-first=Eric &quot;Unit24&quot; |author-last=Guy |access-date=2007-10-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20060406032138/http://www.gruntville.com/reviews/mousepads/corepad_roundup/index.php |archivedate=2006-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the mouse had two large wheels which could roll on virtually any surface. However, most subsequent mechanical mice starting with the steel roller ball mouse have required a mousepad for optimal performance.

The mousepad, the most common mouse accessory, appears most commonly in conjunction with mechanical mice, because to roll smoothly the ball requires more friction than common desk surfaces usually provide. So-called &quot;hard mousepads&quot; for gamers or optical/laser mice also exist.

Most optical and laser mice do not require a pad, the notable exception being early optical mice which relied on a grid on the pad to detect movement (e.g. [[Mouse Systems]]). Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an optical mouse is largely a matter of personal preference. One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the optical or laser tracking, for example, a transparent or reflective surface, such as glass.

== In the marketplace ==
[[File:Assorted computer mice - MfK Bern.jpg|thumb|Computer mice built between 1986 and 2007]]
Around 1981, Xerox included mice with its [[Xerox Star]], based on the mouse used in the 1970s on the Alto computer at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]. [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Symbolics]], [[Lisp Machines]] Inc., and [[Tektronix]] also shipped workstations with mice, starting in about 1981. Later, inspired by the Star, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] released the [[Apple Lisa]], which also used a mouse. However, none of these products achieved large-scale success. Only with the release of the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] in 1984 did the mouse see widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=HWM |title=The Macintosh Phenomenon: Celebrating Twenty Years of the World's Most Adored Desktop Computers |author-first=Andrew |author-last=Chan |pages=74–77 |date=November 2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in games ==
[[File:Logitech-G5-Mouse-Rust.jpg|thumb|[[Logitech G5]] [[laser mouse]] designed for gaming]]

The [[Classic Mac OS]] [[Desk Accessory]] ''Puzzle'' in 1984 was the first game designed specifically for a mouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;mace19840507&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ti4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA56 |title=In Praise of Classics |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1984-05-07 |access-date=2015-02-06 |author-last=Mace |author-first=Scott |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device often functions as an interface for PC-based [[video game|computer games]] and sometimes for [[video game console]]s.

=== First-person shooters ===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
[[First-person shooter|FPSs]] naturally lend themselves to separate and simultaneous control of the player's movement and aim, and on computers this has traditionally been achieved with a combination of keyboard and mouse. Players use the X-axis of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, and the Y-axis for looking up and down; the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs.

Many shooting genre players prefer a mouse over a [[gamepad]] [[analog stick]] because the mouse is a linear input device, which allows for fast and precise control. Holding a stick in a given position produces a corresponding constant movement or rotation, i.e. the output is an [[integral]] of the user's input, and requires that time be spent moving to or from its null position before this input can be given; in contrast, the output of a mouse directly and instantaneously corresponds to how far it is moved in a given direction (often multiplied by an &quot;acceleration&quot; factor derived from how quickly the mouse is moved). The effect of this is that a mouse is well suited to small, precise movements; large, quick movements; and immediate, responsive movements; all of which are important in shooter gaming.&lt;ref name=&quot;gi2006&quot;&gt;Chris Klochek and I. Scott MacKenzie (2006). ''[http://www.yorku.ca/mack/GI2006.pdf Performance measures of game controllers in a three-dimensional environment]''. Proceedings of Graphics Interface 2006. pp. 73–79. Canadian Information Processing Society. {{ISBN|1-56881-308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advantage also extends in varying degrees to similar game styles such as [[third-person shooter]]s.

Some incorrectly [[porting|ported]] games or [[game engine]]s have acceleration and interpolation curves which unintentionally produce excessive, irregular, or even negative acceleration when used with a mouse instead of their native platform's non-mouse default input device. Depending on how deeply hardcoded this misbehavior is, internal user patches or external 3rd-party software may be able to fix it.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamingwiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary:Mouse acceleration – PCGamingWiki PCGW – bugs, fixes, crashes, mods, guides and improvements for every PC game |url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Mouse_acceleration |website=[[PCGamingWiki]] |access-date=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their similarity to the [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] [[desktop metaphor]] interface for which mice were originally designed, and to their own [[tabletop game]] origins, computer [[Strategy video game|strategy games]] are most commonly played with mice. In particular, [[real-time strategy]] and [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] games usually require the use of a mouse.

The left button usually controls primary fire. If the game supports multiple fire modes, the right button often provides secondary fire from the selected weapon. Games with only a single fire mode will generally map secondary fire to ''[[ADS_(video_gaming)|ADS]]''. In some games, the right button may also invoke accessories for a particular weapon, such as allowing access to the scope of a sniper rifle or allowing the mounting of a bayonet or silencer.

Gamers can use a scroll wheel for changing weapons (or for controlling scope-zoom magnification, in older games). On most first person shooter games, programming may also assign more functions to additional buttons on mice with more than three controls. A keyboard usually controls movement (for example, [[WASD keys|WASD]] for moving forward, left, backward and right, respectively) and other functions such as changing posture. Since the mouse serves for aiming, a mouse that tracks movement accurately and with less lag (latency) will give a player an advantage over players with less accurate or slower mice. In some cases the right mouse button may be used to move the player forward, either in lieu of, or in conjunction with the typical WASD configuration.

Many games provide players with the option of mapping their own choice of a key or button to a certain control. An early technique of players, [[circle strafing]], saw a player continuously strafing while aiming and shooting at an opponent by walking in circle around the opponent with the opponent at the center of the circle. Players could achieve this by holding down a key for strafing while continuously aiming the mouse towards the opponent.

Games using mice for input are so popular that many manufacturers make mice specifically for gaming. Such mice may feature adjustable weights, high-resolution optical or laser components, additional buttons, ergonomic shape, and other features such as adjustable [[#Mouse speed|CPI]]. [[Mouse Bungee]]s are typically used with gaming mice because it eliminates the annoyance of the cable.

Many games, such as first- or third-person shooters, have a setting named &quot;invert mouse&quot; or similar (not to be confused with &quot;button inversion&quot;, sometimes performed by [[Handedness|left-handed]] users) which allows the user to look downward by moving the mouse forward and upward by moving the mouse backward (the opposite of non-inverted movement). This control system resembles that of aircraft control sticks, where pulling back causes pitch up and pushing forward causes pitch down; computer [[joystick]]s also typically emulate this control-configuration.

After [[id Software]]'s commercial hit of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which did not support vertical aiming, competitor [[Bungie]]'s ''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'' became the first first-person shooter to support using the mouse to aim up and down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-use-of-freelook-in-a-fps |title=First Use of Freelook in a FPS |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |access-date=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games using the [[Build engine]] had an option to invert the Y-axis. The &quot;invert&quot; feature actually made the mouse behave in a manner that users {{As of|2006|alt=now}} regard as non-inverted (by default, moving mouse forward resulted in looking down). Soon after, id Software released ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', which introduced the invert feature as users {{As of|2007|alt=now}} know it.

In 1988, the [[VTech Socrates]] educational video game console featured a wireless mouse with an attached mouse pad as an optional controller used for some games. In the early 1990s, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game system [[SNES Mouse|featured a mouse]] in addition to its controllers. The ''[[Mario Paint]]'' game in particular used the mouse's capabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2011/aug/19/0819-e1-super-nostalgia-local-gamers-fondly/56755/ |title=Super Nostalgia: Local Gamers Fondly Remember Super Nintendo on Its 20th Anniversary |author-first=Casey |author-last=Phillips |newspaper=[[Times Free Press]] |date=2011-08-19 |access-date=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did its successor on the [[Nintendo 64|N64]]. [[Sega]] released official mice for their [[Sega Genesis|Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. [[NEC]] sold official mice for its [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] and [[PC-FX]] consoles. [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] released an official mouse product for the [[PlayStation]] console, included one along with the [[Linux for PlayStation 2]] kit, as well as allowing owners to use virtually any [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] mouse with the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[PlayStation 3|PS3]], and [[PlayStation 4|PS4]]. Nintendo's [[Wii]] also had this added on in a later software update, retained on the [[Wii U]].
