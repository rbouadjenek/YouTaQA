'''Christian Andreas Doppler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|l|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔplɐ|lang}}; 29 November 1803 – 17 March 1853)&lt;ref name=whonamedit/&gt; was an Austrian [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]]. He is celebrated for his principle – known as the [[Doppler effect]] – that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer. He used this concept to explain the color of [[binary star]]s.

==Biography==
Doppler was born in [[Salzburg]] (today Austria) in 1803. After completing high school, Doppler studied philosophy in Salzburg and mathematics and physics at the Imperial–Royal Polytechnic Institute (now [[TU Wien]]), where he became an assistant in 1829. In 1835 he began work at the Prague Polytechnic (now [[Czech Technical University in Prague]]), where he received an appointment in 1841.

A Doppler research-and memorial society is now housed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-salzburg.net/sights/christiandoppler.htm|title=Visit Salzburg – Christian Doppler birthplace|website=www.visit-salzburg.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One year later, at the age of 38, Doppler gave a lecture to the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences and subsequently published his most notable work, ''[[Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels]]'' (&quot;On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens&quot;). There is a facsimile edition with an English translation by Alec Eden.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlecEden&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

This was independently at the same time when [[physicist]] Armand [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Hippolyte Louis Fizeau]] ({{daterangedash|23 September 1819|18 September 1896|dmy}}) became also involved in aspects of the discovery of the [[Doppler effect]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Houda1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is known by the French as the ''Doppler-Fizeau Effect''. Fizeau contributed towards understanding its effect with light rather than sound, and in doing so, corrected many of Doppler's persistent errors. He also developed the formal mathematical theorem underlying the principles of this effect. In 1848, he discovered the frequency shift of a wave when the source and receiver are moving relative to each other,&lt;ref name=&quot;Houda1991&quot; /&gt; therefore being the first to predict blue shifts and red shifts of light waves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tobin2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Doppler continued working as a professor at the Prague Polytechnic, publishing over 50 articles on mathematics, physics and astronomy, but in 1847 he left Prague for the professorship of mathematics, physics, and mechanics at the Academy of Mines and Forests (its successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]) in [[Selmecbánya]] (then [[Kingdom of Hungary]], now Banská Štiavnica, [[Slovakia]]),

Doppler's research was interrupted by the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary incidents]] of 1848. During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]], he fled to [[Vienna]]. There he was appointed head of the Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1850. While there, Doppler, along with [[Franz Unger]], influenced the development of young [[Gregor Mendel]], the founding father of [[genetics]], who was a student at the University of Vienna from 1851 to 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mathofinheritance&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Doppler died on 17 March 1853 at age 49 from a [[pulmonary disease]] in [[Venice]] (at that time part of the Austrian Empire). His tomb, found by Dr. Peter M. Schuster,&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Peter M.

==Full name==
Some confusion exists about Doppler's full name. Doppler referred to himself as Christian Doppler. The records of his birth and baptism stated Christian ''Andreas'' Doppler. Forty years after Doppler's death the misnomer ''Johann'' Christian Doppler was introduced by the astronomer [[Julius Scheiner]]. Scheiner's mistake has since been copied by many.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlecEden&quot; /&gt;

==Tribute==
On 29 November 2017, [[Google]] celebrated his 214th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/christian-dopplers-214th-birthday|title=Christian Doppler's 214th Birthday|website=Google|date=29 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
