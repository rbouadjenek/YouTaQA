'''Chymotrypsin''' ({{EC number|3.4.21.1}}, chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth, avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar, alpha-chymotrypsin A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a [[digestive enzyme]] component of [[pancreatic juice]] acting in the [[duodenum]], where it performs [[proteolysis]], the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilcox_1970&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilcox PE | year = 1970 | title = Chymotrypsinogens — chymotrypsins | volume = 19 | pages = 64–108 | doi = 10.1016/0076-6879(70)19007-0 | series = Methods in Enzymology | isbn = 978-0-12-181881-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; position) is a large [[hydrophobic]] [[amino acid]] ([[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[phenylalanine]]). These amino acids contain an [[aromatic]] ring in their [[substituent|side chain]] that fits into a [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] pocket (the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; position) of the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of [[trypsin]]. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide [[enzyme substrate|substrate]] P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; side chain and the enzyme S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3555886&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Appel W | title = Chymotrypsin: molecular and catalytic properties | journal = Clin.

Structurally, it is the archetypal structure for its [[superfamily (molecular biology)|superfamily]], the [[PA clan]] of proteases.

== Activation ==

Chymotrypsin is synthesized in the pancreas by [[protein biosynthesis]] as a [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] called [[chymotrypsinogen]] that is enzymatically inactive. Trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen by cleaving peptidic bonds in positions Arg15 - Ile16 and produces π-chymotrypsin. In turn, aminic group (-NH3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Ile16 residue interacts with the side chain of Glu194, producing the &quot;oxyanion hole&quot; and the hydrophobic &quot;S1 pocket&quot;. Moreover, chymotrypsin induces its own activation by cleaving in positions 14-15, 146-147, and 148-149, producing α-chymotrypsin (which is more active and stable than π-chymotrypsin).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The resulting molecule is a three-[[peptide|polypeptide]] molecule interconnected via [[disulfide bond]]s.

== Mechanism of action and kinetics ==
{{See also|Catalytic triad}}
''In vivo'', chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme ([[serine protease]]) acting in the digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a [[hydrolysis]] reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable, occurs extremely slowly in the absence of a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin also hydrolyses amide bonds ''in vitro'', a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.
[[Image:Mechanism_of_peptide_bond_cleavage_in_a-chymotrypsin.svg|thumb|left|450px|Mechanism of peptide bond cleavage in &amp;alpha;-chymotrypsin]]

Chymotrypsin cleaves peptide bonds by attacking the unreactive carbonyl group with a powerful nucleophile, the [[serine]] 195 residue located in the active site of the enzyme, which briefly becomes covalently bonded to the substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate intermediate. Along with [[histidine]] 57 and [[aspartic acid]] 102, this serine residue constitutes the [[catalytic triad]] of the active site.

These findings rely on inhibition assays and the study of the kinetics of cleavage of the aforementioned substrate, exploiting the fact that the enzyme-substrate intermediate [[4-Nitrophenol|''p''-nitrophenolate]] has a yellow colour, enabling  measurement of its concentration by measuring light absorbance at 410&amp;nbsp;nm.

The reaction of chymotrypsin with its substrate was found to take place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase at the beginning of the reaction and a steady-state phase following [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]]. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First, acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate, and then deacylation to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three-amino-acid residues in the catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=Petsko&amp;Ringe&gt;{{cite book|title=Protein Structure and Function |last1=Petsko |first1=Gregory |last2=Ringe |first2=Dagmar |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-955684-7 |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-δ hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its ε nitrogen, thus making it able to deprotonate serine. This deprotonation allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein main chain. Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent main chain N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the protein fragment with the newly formed carboxyl terminus &lt;ref name=Petsko&amp;Ringe /&gt;
