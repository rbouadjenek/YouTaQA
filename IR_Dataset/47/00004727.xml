'''''Batman''''' (also known as '''''Batman: The Movie''''') is a 1966 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]], and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. Released by [[20th Century Fox]], the film starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The film hit theaters two months after the [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 1: 1966|last episode of the first season]] of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of [[Lee Meriwether]] as [[Catwoman]], the character previously played by [[Julie Newmar]] in two episodes of the series' first season.

==Plot==
When Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the [[Batcopter]]. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-[[shark repellent]], the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in [[Gotham City]]: [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]], [[Riddler|the Riddler]], and [[Catwoman|the Catwoman]].

The four criminals equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), escape in a war-surplus submarine made to resemble a [[penguin]], and recruit three pirate-themed henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). Batman and Robin learn the yacht was really a holographic projection and return via [[Batboat]] to a buoy concealing a projector, where they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] journalist &quot;Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff&quot; (acronymed as Kitka), helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Bruce Wayne fights his way out of captivity, he again disguises himself as Batman, and the Dynamic Duo returns to the United Underworld's HQ, only to find a smoking bomb. Batman is met with frustration rushing all over the docks in hopes of locating a safe place to dispose of the bomb but does so in the nick of time. The Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the [[Batcave]] along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into [[antimatter]] once struck: the Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic [[heavy water]] used to recharge the Batcave's [[atomic pile]], leaving them highly unstable.

Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council. Giving chase in the [[Batboat]] to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable The Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his &quot;true love&quot; Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the vials containing the powdered Council members and sneezes on them, scattering the dust.

Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate Super Molecular Dust Separator to filter the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

With the world watching, the [[Security Council]] is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and well, but continue to squabble amongst themselves, totally oblivious of their surroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this &quot;mixing of minds&quot; does more good than it does harm. The duo quietly leaves [[United Nations Headquarters|United World Headquarters]] by climbing out of the window and descending on their batropes.

The film includes most members of the original TV cast: the actors for Batman, Robin, Alfred, Gordon, O'Hara, Aunt Harriet, the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler all reprised their roles. Though [[Julie Newmar]] had at this point played [[Catwoman]] in two episodes of [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 1: 1966|season one]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]], she had other commitments at that time&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Bob, &quot;Batman: Catwoman,&quot; ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Vol. 26, #6/Vol. 7, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 19 (interview with Julie Newmar).&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Lee Meriwether]] in the film. According to the [[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] special ''[[Catwoman]]: Her Many Lives'', aired on July 20, 2004, Newmar was unable to reprise her role because of a back injury. [[Catwoman]] was nonetheless played by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 2: 1966–67|season two]] of the series; [[Eartha Kitt]] would then play [[Catwoman]] in three episodes of [[List of Batman television episodes#Season 3: 1967–68|season three]].

In his autobiography, [[Adam West]] writes of his asking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the fact that another actor would be hired. ''Batman'' was Denny's final film appearance. [[Jack LaLanne]] has a cameo as a man on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiddiematinee.com/b-batman.html |title=BATMAN (1966, U.S.) |publisher=Kiddiematinee.com |accessdate=2011-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220084913/http://kiddiematinee.com/b-batman.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[William Dozier]] wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed [[Batman]] TV series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, [[20th Century Fox]], refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Bob, &quot;Batman: Making the Original Movie&quot;, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film features many characters from the show. It was written by series writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] and directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Geoff Boucher | url = http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/05/17/batman-flash-gordon-lorenzo-semple-jr/ | title = Camp it up: The writer of ‘Batman’ and ‘Flash Gordon’ answers five questions | date = 2010-05-17 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes: &quot;The Penguin Goes Straight&quot; and &quot;Not Yet, He Ain't&quot;.

===Tone and themes===
Even though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. They felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader &quot;captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman (1966)]. Retrieved 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was, they remind us, made at a time when &quot;the Batman of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comics]] was already essentially neutered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Groucho&quot;&gt;[http://www.grouchoreviews.com/reviews/2125 GrouchoReviews.com Review of 'Batman']&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groucho&quot; /&gt; The penchant for giving devices a &quot;Bat-&quot; prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of ''Batman''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |title=Museum of Broadcast Communication's entry on the parent TV show |publisher=Museum.TV |accessdate=2010-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020620023932/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |archive-date=June 20, 2002 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into [[Cold War]] issues paying heavy attention to [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris Missiles]], [[War surplus|war surplus submarines]] and taking a poke at [[the Pentagon]]. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.&lt;ref&gt;Batman at 45: A Milestone Tribute to Pow, Bam and Zap!, Chris Gould, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
[[File:1960s Batmobile (FMC).jpg|thumb|right|The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series.]]
Besides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:
* [[Batcycle]] with side car
* [[Batboat]], provided by [[Glastron]]
* [[Batcopter]]

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' film, only the [[Batcycle]] properly crossed over into the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]] as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie appeared briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: &quot;[[Walk the Straight and Narrow]]&quot;), they primarily did so in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.

==Soundtrack==

==Release==
''Batman'' premiered at the [[Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]]); it was moderately successful at the box office. The [[Batboat]] featured in the film was created by Austin-based company [[Glastron]], whose payment was in having the film premiere in their hometown. In conjunction with the premiere, Jean Boone of Austin CBS affiliate station [[KTBC (TV)|KTBC]] interviewed the film's cast, including [[Lee Meriwether]], [[Cesar Romero]], and [[Adam West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Boone - Interview with Cast of Batman, The Movie (1966)|url=http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=Jean_Boone_-_Interview_with_Cast_of_Batman%2C_The_Movie_%281966%29&amp;gsearch=batman|work=Gordon Wilkison Collection|publisher=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|accessdate=28 July 2011|date=July 1966|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144128/http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=Jean_Boone_-_Interview_with_Cast_of_Batman%2C_The_Movie_%281966%29&amp;gsearch=batman|archivedate=April 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
