'''Chuck-a-luck''', also known as '''birdcage''', is a [[gambling|game of chance]] played with three [[dice]]. It is derived from [[grand hazard]] and both can be considered a variant of [[sic bo]], which is a popular [[casino game]], although chuck-a-luck is more of a [[carnival game]] than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for [[Charitable organization|charity]].

==Rules==
Chuck-a-luck is played with three standard [[dice]] that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an [[hourglass]] that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.

Wagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice.  The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in [[sic bo]] and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game.

The wagers, and their associated odds, that are typically available are set out in the table below.&lt;!-- Note that &quot;dice&quot; is plural, the  singular being &quot;die&quot;; do not &quot;correct&quot; this, as you would actually be introducing a grammatical error --&gt;

==House advantage or edge==
{{Expert-subject|Gambling|section|date=February 2009}}
Chuck-a-luck is a [[gambling|game of chance]]. On average, the players are expected to lose more than they win.  The casino's advantage ([[house advantage]] or house edge) is greater than most other [[casino games]] and can be much greater.

For example, there are 216 (6 × 6 × 6) possible outcomes for a single throw of three dice. For a specific number:

* there are 75 possible outcomes, where only one die will match the number;&lt;!-- Note that &quot;dice&quot; is plural, the  singular being &quot;die&quot;; do not &quot;correct&quot; this, as you would actually be introducing a grammatical error --&gt;
* there are 15 possible outcomes, where only two dice will match; and
* there is one possible outcome, where all three dice will match.

At odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 10 to 1 respectively for each of these types of outcome, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:

1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 3 + (1/216) × 11) = 4.6%

At worse odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:

1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 3 + (1/216) × 4) = 7.9%

If the odds are adjusted to 1 to 1, 3 to 1 and 5 to 1 respectively, the expected loss as a percentage is:

1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 4 + (1/216) × 6) = 0%

However, commercially organised gambling games always have a house advantage which acts as a fee for the privilege of being allowed to play the game, so the last scenario does not represent real practice.

==Variants==
* A version of the [[Big Six wheel]] is loosely based on chuck-a-luck, with various combinations of three dice appearing in 54 slots on a spinning wheel. Because of the distribution of the combinations, the house advantage or edge for this wheel is greater than for chuck-a-luck.
* Chuck-a-luck is essentially identical to the traditional Vietnamese game [[Bau cua ca cop]].

==In popular culture==
