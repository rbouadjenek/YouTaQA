'''Conjugation''' or '''conjugate''' may refer to:
{{TOC right}}

==Linguistics==
* [[Grammatical conjugation]], the modification of a verb from its basic form
&lt;!-- there are numerous articles such as [[Dutch conjugation]], [[French conjugation]], [[Latin conjugation]]; probably not advisable to list all of them here --&gt;

==Mathematics==
* [[Complex conjugation]], the change of sign of the imaginary part of a complex number
* [[Conjugate (square roots)]], the change of sign of a square root in an expression
* [[Conjugate element (field theory)]], a generalization of the preceding conjugations to roots of a polynomial of any degree 
* [[Conjugate transpose]], the complex conjugate of the transpose of a matrix
* [[Harmonic conjugate]] in complex analysis
* [[Conjugate (graph theory)]], an alternative term for a line graph, i.e. a graph representing the edge adjacencies of another graph
* In group theory, various notions are called conjugation: 
** [[Inner automorphism]], a type of conjugation homomorphism
** [[Conjugacy class|Conjugation]] in group theory, related to matrix similarity in linear algebra
** [[Conjugation (group theory)]], the image of an element under the conjugation homomorphisms
** [[Conjugate closure]], the image of a subgroup under the conjugation homomorphisms
* [[Isogonal conjugate]], in geometry
* [[Conjugate gradient method]], an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations
* [[Conjugate points]], in differential geometry
* [[Topological conjugation]], which identifies equivalent dynamical systems
* [[Convex conjugate]], the (&quot;dual&quot;) lower-semicontinuous convex function resulting from the Legendre–Fenchel transformation of a &quot;primal&quot; function

==Probability and statistics==
* [[Conjugate prior]], in Bayesian statistics, a family of probability distributions that contains a prior and the posterior distributions for a particular likelihood function (particularly for one-parameter exponential families)
* Conjugate pairing of probability distributions, in the Fourier-analytic theory of [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]s and statistical mechanics

==Biology==
* [[Sexual conjugation]], a type of isogamy in eukaryotes
* [[Bacterial conjugation|Conjugation (microbiology)]], a mechanism of exchange of genetic material between bacteria
* [[Conjugation (biochemistry)]], the turning of substances into a hydrophilic state in the body
* [[Conjugate vaccine]], in immunology

==Chemistry==
* [[Conjugation (acid-base theory)]], a system describing a conjugate acid-base pair
* [[Conjugated system]], a system of atoms covalently bonded with alternating single and multiple bonds

==Physics==
* [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)]], the internal energy of a system
* [[Conjugate quantities]], observables that are linked by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
* [[Conjugate focal plane]], in optics

==See also==

*{{intitle|conjugation}}
*{{intitle|conjugate}}
&lt;!-- partial title matches below; if any of these are commonly referred to as just &quot;conjugate&quot; or &quot;conjugation&quot;
     (and that is indicated by the linked article), those could be moved to the main list. Others can be kept
     in See also or deleted entirely --&gt;
