== Medical uses ==

The original indication of chloramphenicol was in the treatment of [[typhoid]], but the now almost universal presence of multiple drug-resistant ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' has meant it is seldom used for this indication except when the organism is known to be sensitive.

In low-income countries, the WHO no longer recommends oily chloramphenicol as first-line to treat meningitis, but recognises it may be used with caution if there are no available alternatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHOMeningitis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO meningitis epidemic guidelines Africa|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/HSE_GAR_ERI_2010_4/en/|accessdate=29 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305134645/http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/HSE_GAR_ERI_2010_4/en/|archivedate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of preventing [[endophthalmitis]], a complication of [[cataract]] surgery, a 2017 systematic review found moderate evidence that using chloramphenicol eye drops in addition to an antibiotic injection ([[cefuroxime]] or [[penicillin]]) will likely lower the risk of endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or antibiotic injections alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gower&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Gower EW, Lindsley K, Tulenko SE, Nanji AA, Leyngold I, McDonnell PJ |title= Perioperative antibiotics for prevention of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= 2|issue=2|pages= CD006364 |date=2017 |pmid= 28192644|pmc= 5375161 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006364.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectrum===
Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating ocular infections such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis etc. caused by a number of bacteria including ''Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and ''Escherichia coli''. It is not effective against ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. The following susceptibility data represent the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] for a few medically significant organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_507.html |title=Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) &amp;#124; the Antimicrobial Index Knowledgebase - TOKU-E |accessdate=2014-04-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423055139/http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_507.html |archivedate=2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Escherichia coli'':  0.015&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;10,000&amp;nbsp;μg/mL
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': 0.06&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;128&amp;nbsp;μg/mL
* ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'': 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;16&amp;nbsp;μg/mL
Each of these concentrations is dependent upon the bacterial strain being targeted. Some strains of ''E. coli'', for example, show spontaneous emergence of chloramphenicol resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carone|first=BR|author2=Xu, T |author3=Murphy, KC |author4= Marinus, MG |title=High incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant cells in cultures of in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.|journal=Mutation Research|date=Jan 2014|volume=759|pages=1–8|pmid=24361397 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2013.11.008|pmc=3913999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=AM|author2=Patel, S |author3=Forsberg, KJ |author4=Wang, B |author5=Bentley, G |author6=Razia, Y |author7=Qin, X |author8=Tarr, PI |author9= Dantas, G |title=Pediatric fecal microbiota harbor diverse and novel antibiotic resistance genes|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78822|pmid=24236055 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078822 |pmc=3827270|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878822M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===

Three mechanisms of [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to chloramphenicol are known: reduced membrane permeability, mutation of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and elaboration of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.  It is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to chloramphenicol ''in vitro'' by serial passage of bacteria, and this is the most common mechanism of low-level chloramphenicol resistance.  High-level resistance is conferred by the ''cat''-gene; this [[gene]] codes for an [[enzyme]] called [[chloramphenicol acetyltransferase]], which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two [[acetyl]] groups, derived from acetyl-''S''-coenzyme A, to the [[hydroxyl]] groups on the chloramphenicol molecule. The acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome.  Resistance-conferring mutations of the 50S ribosomal subunit are rare.

Chloramphenicol resistance may be carried on a plasmid that also codes for resistance to other drugs.  One example is the [[ACCoT]] plasmid (A=[[ampicillin]], C=chloramphenicol, Co=[[co-trimoxazole]], T=[[tetracycline]]), which mediates [[multiple drug resistance]] in typhoid (also called [[R factors]]).

As of 2014 some ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'' and'' [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' strains are resistant to chloramphenicol. Some ''[[Veillonella]]'' spp. and ''[[Staphylococcus capitis]]'' strains have also developed resistance to chloramphenicol to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chloramphenicol spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211211304/http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==

===Aplastic anemia===

The most serious [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of chloramphenicol treatment is [[aplastic anaemia]]. This effect is rare and sometimes fatal. The risk of AA is high enough that alternatives should be strongly considered. Treatments are available but expensive. No way exists to predict who may or may not get this side effect.  The effect usually occurs weeks or months after treatment has been stopped, and a genetic predisposition may be involved.  It is not known whether monitoring the [[blood count]]s of patients can prevent the development of aplastic anaemia, but patients are recommended to have a baseline blood count with a repeat blood count every few days while on treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hammett-Stabler, C. |author2=Johns, T. | title = Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 44| issue = 5 | pages = 1129–1140 |date=May 1988 | pmid = 9590397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloramphenicol should be discontinued if the complete blood count drops.  The highest risk is with oral chloramphenicol (affecting 1 in 24,000–40,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wallerstein, R. |author2=Condit, P. |author3=Kasper, C. |author4=Brown, J. |author5=Morrison, F. | title = Statewide study of chloramphenicol therapy and fatal aplastic anemia | journal = JAMA | volume = 208 | issue = 11 | pages = 2045–2050 |date=June 1969 | pmid = 5818983 | doi = 10.1001/jama.208.11.2045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lowest risk occurs with eye drops (affecting less than one in 224,716 prescriptions).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster1998&quot;/&gt;

[[Thiamphenicol]], a related compound with a similar spectrum of activity, is available in Italy and China for human use, and has never been associated with aplastic anaemia. Thiamphenicol is available in the U.S. and Europe as a [[veterinary]] antibiotic, but is not approved for use in humans.

===Bone marrow suppression===
Chloramphenicol may cause [[bone marrow suppression]] during treatment; this is a direct toxic effect of the drug on human [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2486534&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yunis AA |title=Chloramphenicol toxicity: 25 years of research |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=87 |issue=3N |pages=44N–48N |date=September 1989 |pmid=2486534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect manifests first as a fall in [[hemoglobin]] levels, which occurs quite predictably once a cumulative dose of 20&amp;nbsp;g has been given. The anaemia is fully reversible once the drug is stopped and does not predict future development of aplastic anaemia. Studies in mice have suggested existing marrow damage may compound any marrow damage resulting from the toxic effects of chloramphenicol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morley|first=Alec|author2=Trainor, Kevin |author3=Remes, Judith |title=Residual Marrow Damage: Possible Explanation for Idiosyncrasy to Chloramphenicol|journal=British Journal of Haematology|date=1 April 1976|volume=32|issue=4|pages=525–532|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00955.x|pmid=1259934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leukemia===
Leukemia, a cancer of the blood or bone marrow, is characterized by an abnormal increase of immature white blood cells. The risk of childhood [[leukemia]] is increased, as demonstrated in a Chinese [[case–control study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shu, X. |author2=Gao, Y. |author3=Linet, M. |author4=Brinton, L. |author5=Gao, R. |author6=Jin, F. |author7=Fraumeni, J. | title = Chloramphenicol use and childhood leukaemia in Shanghai | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8565 | pages = 934–937 |date=October 1987 | pmid = 2889862 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(87)91420-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the risk increases with length of treatment.

===Gray baby syndrome===
Intravenous chloramphenicol use has been associated with the so-called [[gray baby syndrome]].&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=McIntyre_2004&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McIntyre, J. |author2=Choonara, I. | title = Drug toxicity in the neonate | journal = Biology of the Neonate | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–221 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15249753 | doi = 10.1159/000079656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This phenomenon occurs in newborn infants because they do not yet have fully functional liver enzymes (i.e. UDP-glucuronyl transferase), so chloramphenicol remains unmetabolized in the body.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Piñeiro-Carrero_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Piñeiro-Carrero, V. |author2=Piñeiro, E. | title = Liver | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 4 Supplement | pages = 1097–1106 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15060205 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_3/1097.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This causes several adverse effects, including [[hypotension]] and [[cyanosis]]. The condition can be prevented by using the drug at the recommended doses, and monitoring blood levels.&lt;!--

===Hypersensitivity reactions===
Fever, macular and vesicular rashes, angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis may occur. Herxheimer's reactions have occurred during therapy for typhoid fever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drug Insert from DailyMed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Insert from DailyMed|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08c16a42-1ad4-400f-b1b0-75303eb86713|accessdate=18 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012007/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08c16a42-1ad4-400f-b1b0-75303eb86713|archivedate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurotoxic reactions===
Headache, mild depression, mental confusion, and delirium have been described in patients receiving chloramphenicol. Optic and peripheral neuritis have been reported, usually following long-term therapy. If this occurs, the drug should be promptly withdrawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drug Insert from DailyMed&quot; /&gt;

==Pharmacokinetics==
Chloramphenicol is extremely lipid-soluble; it remains relatively [[plasma protein binding|unbound to protein]] and is a small molecule. It has a large apparent [[volume of distribution]] and penetrates effectively into all tissues of the body, including the brain.  Distribution is not uniform, with highest concentrations found in the liver and kidney, with lowest in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drug Insert from DailyMed&quot; /&gt;  The concentration achieved in brain and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] &lt;!-- (CSF) --&gt; is around 30 to 50% of the overall average body concentration, even when the meninges are not inflamed; this increases to as high as 89% when the meninges are inflamed.

Chloramphenicol increases the absorption of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Pill Book, The | title = Iron Supplements | pages = 593–596 |editor1=Harold M. Silverman |editor2=Pharm.D. (-in-chief) | publisher = Bantam Dell | location = New York | edition = 12th revised | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-553-58892-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in special populations===
Chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver to chloramphenicol [[glucuronic acid|glucuronate]] (which is inactive).  In liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced. No standard dose reduction exists for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.

The majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate.  Only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.  Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory.  Chloramphenicol succinate ester (an intravenous [[prodrug]] form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Chloramphenicol passes into [[breast milk]], so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible.&lt;ref name=kidsgrowth&gt;[http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 kidsgrowth.org --&gt; Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623011707/http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 |date=2007-06-23 }} Retrieved on June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dose monitoring===
[[Blood plasma|Plasma]] levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and patients with abnormal liver function.  Plasma levels should be monitored in all children under the age of four, the elderly, and patients with [[kidney failure]].
Because efficacy and toxicity of chloramphenicol are associated with a maximum serum concentration, peak levels (one hour after the intravenous dose is given) should be 10–20&amp;nbsp;µg/ml with toxicity {{nowrap|&gt; 40 µg/ml}}; trough levels (taken immediately before a dose) should be 5–10&amp;nbsp;µg/ml.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammett-Stabler|first=C|author2=Johns, T.|title=Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=May 1988|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1129–1140|pmid=9590397}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lexicomp Online Database&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chloramphenicol (Lexi-Drugs)|url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6582|work=Lexi-Comp Online|accessdate=18 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726053121/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6582|archivedate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug interactions===
Administration of chloramphenicol concomitantly with bone marrow depressant drugs is contraindicated, although concerns over aplastic anaemia associated with ocular chloramphenicol have largely been discounted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051022000549/http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/otcchlorampheneyedropsguid.pdf ] June 2005.

===Drug antagonistic===
Chloramphenicol is antagonistic with most [[cephalosporin]]s and using both together should be avoided in the treatment of infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19960295 |title=Antagonistic effect of chloramphenicol in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145137/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/19960295_Antagonistic_effect_of_chloramphenicol_in_combination_with_cefotaxime_or_ceftriaxone |archivedate=September 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==

Chloramphenicol is a [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] by [[protein synthesis inhibitor|inhibiting protein synthesis]].  It prevents [[protein synthesis|protein chain elongation]] by inhibiting the [[peptidyl transferase]] activity of the bacterial [[ribosome]]. It specifically binds to A2451 and A2452 residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mycobacterial toxin MazF-mt6 inhibits translation through cleavage of 23S rRNA at the ribosomal A site | date = May 2013 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |vauthors=Schifano JM, Edifor R, Sharp JD | pmid = 23650345 | pmc=3666664 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1222031110 | volume=110 | issue = 21 | pages=8501–6|display-authors=etal| bibcode = 2013PNAS..110.8501S }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[23S ribosomal RNA|23S rRNA]] of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch170/ch170d.html | title = Chloramphenicol | work = The Merck Manual | publisher = Merck | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100310105845/http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch170/ch170d.html | archivedate = 2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloramphenicol directly interferes with substrate binding in the ribosome, as compared to [[Macrolide|macrolides]], which sterically block the progression of the growing peptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/238/7/2498.full.pdf | title = Studies on the Mechanism of Action of Chloramphenicol – The Conformation of Chloramphenicol in Solution | date = July 1963 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 238 | issue = 7 |authorlink1=Oleg Jardetzky| author = Jardetzky, O. | pmid = 13957484 | pages = 2498–2508 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211033031/http://www.jbc.org/content/238/7/2498.full.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolfe | first1 = A.

== History ==
Chloramphenicol was first isolated from ''[[Streptomyces venezuelae]]'' in 1947 and in 1949 a team of scientists at [[Parke-Davis]] including [[Mildred Rebstock]] published their identification of the chemical structure and their synthesis, making it the first antibiotic to be made instead of extracted from a micro-organism.&lt;ref name=Pong1979/&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rebstock|first1=Mildred C.|last2=Crooks|first2=Harry M.|last3=Controulis|first3=John.|last4=Bartz|first4=Quentin R.|title=Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin).IV.Chemical Studies|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=July 1949|volume=71|issue=7|pages=2458–2462|doi=10.1021/ja01175a065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Controulis|first1=John.|last2=Rebstock|first2=Mildred C.|last3=Crooks|first3=Harry M.|title=Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin).

In 2007, the accumulation of reports associating aplastic anemia and blood dyscrasia with chloramphenicol eye drops lead to the classification of “probable human carcinogen” according to World Health Organization criteria, based on the known published case reports and the spontaneous reports submitted to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fraunfelder, F. |author2=Fraunfelder, F | title = Restricting Topical Ocular Chloramphenicol Eye Drop Use in the United States. Did We Overreact? | journal = American Journal of Ophthalmology| volume = 156| issue = 3 | pages = 420–422 |date=September 2013 | pmid = 23953152 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2013.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
In many areas of the world an intravenous dose is about US$0.40–1.90.&lt;ref name=ERC2015/&gt; In the United States it costs about $3.60 per dose in oral tablet form at wholesale.

===Names===
Chloramphenicol is available as a generic worldwide under many brandnames&lt;ref&gt;Drugs.com [https://www.drugs.com/international/chloramphenicol.html drugs.com international listings for chloramphenicol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711033900/http://www.drugs.com/international/chloramphenicol.html |date=2015-07-11 }} Page accessed July 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and also under various generic names in eastern Europe and Russia, including chlornitromycin, levomycetin, and chloromycetin; the racemate is known as synthomycetin.&lt;ref name=levomyc-free-sovdict&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition, 1970–1979|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|edition=3|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Levomycetin|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulations===
[[File:Sample of Chloramphenicol.jpg|thumb|Pure chloramphenicol]]
Chloramphenicol is available as a capsule or as a liquid. In some countries, it is sold as chloramphenicol [[palmitate]] [[ester]] (CPE). CPE is inactive, and is [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] to active chloramphenicol in the [[small intestine]]. No difference in [[bioavailability]] is noted between chloramphenicol and CPE.

Manufacture of oral chloramphenicol in the U.S. stopped in 1991, because the vast majority of chloramphenicol-associated cases of aplastic anaemia are associated with the oral preparation. No oral formulation of chloramphenicol is now available in the U.S.

In molecular biology, chloramphenicol is prepared in ethanol.

====Intravenous====
The [[intravenous]] (IV) preparation of chloramphenicol is the succinate ester, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water.  This creates a problem: Chloramphenicol succinate ester is an inactive [[prodrug]] and must first be hydrolysed to chloramphenicol; however, the hydrolysis process is often incomplete, and 30% of the dose is lost and removed in the urine.  Serum concentrations of IV chloramphenicol are only 70% of those achieved when chloramphenicol is given orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Glazko, A. J. |author2=Dill, W. A. |author3=Kinkel, A. W. | title = Absorption and excretion of parenteral doses of chloramphenicol sodium succinate in comparison with per oral doses of chloramphenicol (abstract) | journal = Clinical Pharmacological Therapy | year = 1977 | volume = 21 | pages = 104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, the dose needs to be increased to 75&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day when administered IV to achieve levels equivalent to the oral dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bhutta, Z. |author2=Niazi, S. |author3=Suria, A. | title = Chloramphenicol Clearance in Typhoid Fever: Implications for Therapy | journal = Indian Journal of Pediatry | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–219 |date=March–April 1992 | pmid = 1398851 | doi = 10.1007/BF02759987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oily====
Oily chloramphenicol (or chloramphenicol oil suspension) is a long-acting preparation of chloramphenicol first introduced by Roussel in 1954; marketed as Tifomycine, it was originally used as a treatment for [[typhoid]].  Roussel stopped production of oily chloramphenicol in 1995; the [[International Dispensary Association]] has manufactured it since 1998, first in [[Malta]] and then in [[India]] from December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewis, R.

Oily chloramphenicol was first used to treat meningitis in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rey, M. |author2=Ouedraogo, L. |author3=Saliou, P. |author4=Perino, L. | title = Traitement minute de la méningite cérébrospinale épidémique par injection intramusculaire unique de chloramphénicol (suspension huileuse) | journal = Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses | language = french | year = 1976 | volume = 6 | pages = 120–124 | doi = 10.1016/S0399-077X(76)80134-5 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies since have demonstrated its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wali, S. |author2=Macfarlane, J. |author3=Weir, W. |author4=Cleland, P. |author5=Ball, P. |author6=Hassan-King, M. |author7=Whittle, H. |author8=Greenwood, B. | title = Single injection treatment of meningococcal meningitis. 2.

It has the great advantage of requiring only a single injection, whereas ceftriaxone is traditionally given daily for five days.  This recommendation may yet change, now that a single dose of ceftriaxone (cost US$3) has been shown to be equivalent to one dose of oily chloramphenicol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ceftriaxone as effective as long-acting chloramphenicol in short-course treatment of meningococcal meningitis during epidemics: a randomised non-inferiority study | journal = Lancet |author1=Nathan, N. |author2=Borel, T. |author3=Djibo, A. | year = 2005 | volume = 366 | issue = 9482 | pages = 308–313 | pmid = 16039333 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66792-X |hdl=10144/23232 | url = https://fieldresearch.msf.org/bitstream/10144/23232/1/187_Ceftriaxone_as_effective_as_long-acting_-_Lancet_9482_2005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eye drops====
Chloramphenicol is still used occasionally in topical preparations ([[ointment]]s and [[eye drop]]s) for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Isolated case reports of [[aplastic anaemia]] following use of chloramphenicol eyedrops exist, but the risk is estimated to be of the order of less than one in 224,716 prescriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lancaster, T. | author2 = Stewart, A.

==Veterinary uses==
Although its use in veterinary medicine is highly restricted, chloramphenicol still has some important veterinary uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chloramphenicol and Congeners|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/pharmacology/antibacterial_agents/chloramphenicol_and_congeners.html|publisher=Merck Manuals|accessdate=31 October 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031232305/http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/pharmacology/antibacterial_agents/chloramphenicol_and_congeners.html|archivedate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently considered the most useful treatment of chlamydial disease in [[koala]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Govendir|first1=M|title=Plasma concentrations of chloramphenicol after subcutaneous administration to koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) with chlamydiosis|journal=Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=35|issue=2|date=16 May 2011|pages=147–154|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2885.2011.01307.x|pmid=21569052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=J.|title=Diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for koala chlamydiosis at a rehabilitation facility (1995–2005)|journal=Australian Veterinary Journal|date=2012|volume=90|issue=11|pages=457–463|doi=10.1111/j.1751-0813.2012.00963.x|pmid=23106328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pharmacokinetics of chloramphenicol have been investigated in koalas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Lisa|journal=Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=36|issue=5|pages=478–485|doi=10.1111/jvp.12024|pmid=23157306|title=Pharmacokinetics of chloramphenicol following administration of intravenous and subcutaneous chloramphenicol sodium succinate, and subcutaneous chloramphenicol, to koalas ( Phascolarctos cinereus )|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
