'''Cetus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə|s}}) is a [[constellation]]. Its name refers to [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a [[sea monster]] in [[Greek mythology]] as both [[Perseus]] and [[Heracles]] needed to slay, sometimes in English called 'the [[whale]]'. Cetus is in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].  

==Features==
[[Image:CetusCC.jpg|thumb|Cetus annotated with lines (a &quot;stick figure&quot;) from a latitude further north (north of its declination), above a horizon, in conditions ideal for observation.]]

===Ecliptic===
Although Cetus is not generally considered part of the [[zodiac]], the [[ecliptic]] passes less than a quarter of a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets and part of the sun will enter Cetus in most of their successive orbits for brief periods of time.  This holds stronger for many asteroids since their orbits usually have a greater [[inclination]] to the ecliptic than the moon and planets.

[[Astronomy on Mars#Celestial poles and ecliptic|As seen from Mars]], the ecliptic passes into Cetus, with the sun appearing in Cetus for around six days shortly after the northern summer solstice. Mars's orbit is tilted by 1.85° with respect to Earth's.

===Stars===
{{main article|List of stars in Cetus}}
[[Mira]] (&quot;the Wonderful&quot;), designated [[Omicron Ceti]], was the first [[variable star]] to be discovered and the prototype of [[Mira variable|its class]]. Over a period of 332 days, it reaches a maximum [[apparent magnitude]] of 3 - visible to the naked eye - and dips to a minimum magnitude of 10, invisible to the unaided eye. Its seeming appearance and disappearance gave it its common name, which means &quot;the amazing one&quot;. Mira [[pulsating variable|pulsates]] with a minimum size of 400 solar diameters and a maximum size of 500 solar diameters. 420 light-years from Earth, it was discovered by [[David Fabricius]] in 1596.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

[[Alpha Ceti|α Ceti]], traditionally called Menkar (&quot;the nose&quot;), is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 2.5, 220 light-years from Earth. It is a wide [[double star]]; the secondary is [[93 Ceti]], a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.6, 440 light-years away. [[Beta Ceti|β Ceti]], also called Deneb Kaitos and Diphda is the brightest star in Cetus. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.0, 96 light-years from Earth. The traditional name &quot;Deneb Kaitos&quot; means &quot;the whale's tail&quot;. [[Gamma Ceti|γ Ceti]], Kaffaljidhma (&quot;head of the whale&quot;) is a very close double star. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5, 82 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 6.6.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}} [[Tau Ceti]] is noted for being the nearest [[Sun-like star]] at a distance of 11.9 light-years. It is a yellow-hued [[main-sequence star]] of magnitude 3.5.

[[AA Ceti]] is a triple star system; the brightest member has a magnitude of 6.2. The primary and secondary are separated by 8.4 arcseconds at an angle of 304 degrees. The tertiary is not visible in telescopes. AA Ceti is an eclipsing variable star; the tertiary star passes in front of the primary and causes the system's apparent magnitude to decrease by 0.5 magnitudes.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=67}} [[UV Ceti]] is an unusual binary variable star. 8.7 light-years from Earth, the system consists of two [[red dwarfs]]. Both of magnitude 13. One of the stars is a [[flare star]], which are prone to sudden, random outbursts that last several minutes; these increase the pair's apparent brightness significantly - as high as magnitude 7.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.jpg|thumb|Messier 77 spiral galaxy - HST (Hubble Space Telescope).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble observes the hidden depths of Messier 77|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1305/|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Himmelsglob, 1602 - Skoklosters slott - 102439.tif|thumb|Cetus by Willem Blaeu, 1602.]]
Cetus lies far from the [[galactic plane]], so that many distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] are visible, unobscured by dust from the [[Milky Way]]. Of these, the brightest is [[Messier 77]] (NGC 1068), a 9th magnitude [[spiral galaxy]] near [[Delta Ceti]]. It appears face-on and has a clearly visible nucleus of magnitude 10. About 50 million light-years from Earth, M77 is also a [[Seyfert galaxy]] and thus a bright object in the [[radio spectrum]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}} Recently, the galactic cluster [[JKCS 041|JKCS&amp;nbsp;041]] was confirmed to be the most distant [[cluster of galaxies]] yet discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists identify new |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/756711-scientists-identify-new-galaxy|newspaper=Metro|date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive [[cD galaxy]] [[Holmberg 15A]] is also found in Cetus.  As is spiral galaxy [[NGC 1042]] and ultra-diffuse galaxy [[NGC 1052-DF2]]. 

IC 1613 ([[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell]] 51) is an irregular [[dwarf galaxy]] near the star 26 Ceti and is a member of the Local Group.

[[NGC 246]] (Caldwell 56), also called the Cetus Ring, is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 8.0, 1600 light-years from Earth. Among some amateur astronomers, NGC 246 has garnered the nickname &quot;Pac-Man Nebula&quot; because of the arrangement of its central stars and the surrounding star field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=129}}

==History and mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Psalterium Georgii, Fluvius Eridanus, Cetus, Officina Sculptoris, Fornax Chemica, and Machina Electrica.jpg|thumb|Cetus dominates this card from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825) as if looking up towards the celestial sphere (east is left of frame).  Uses the modern custom: celestial maps to be held skywards while facing south.]]
[[File:Alexander_Jamieson_Celestial_Atlas-Plate_23.jpg|thumb|An alike depiction from ''Celestial Atlas'' (A. Jamieson) (1822)]]
Cetus may have originally been associated with a [[whale]], which would have had mythic status amongst Mesopotamian cultures. It is often now called the Whale, though it is most strongly associated with [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus the sea-monster]], who was slain by [[Perseus]] as he saved the princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from [[Poseidon]]'s wrath. Cetus is located in a region of the sky called &quot;The Sea&quot; because many water-associated constellations are placed there, including [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], [[Piscis Austrinus]], [[Capricornus]], and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staal|1988|pp=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cetus has been depicted in many ways throughout its history. In the 17th century, Cetus was depicted as a &quot;dragon fish&quot; by [[Johann Bayer]]. Both [[Willem Blaeu]] and [[Andreas Cellarius]] depicted Cetus as a whale-like creature in the same century. However, Cetus has also been variously depicted with animal heads attached to a piscine body.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

===In global astronomy===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Cetus are found among two areas: the [[Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'') and the [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'').

The Brazilian [[Tukano]] and [[Kobeua]] people used the stars of Cetus to create a [[jaguar]], representing the god of hurricanes and other violent storms. Lambda, Mu, Xi, Nu, Gamma, and Alpha Ceti represented its head; Omicron, Zeta, and Chi Ceti represented its body; Eta Eri, Tau Cet, and Upsilon Cet marked its legs and feet; and Theta, Eta, and  Beta Ceti delineated its tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;staal&quot;/&gt;

In [[Hawaii]], the constellation was called ''Na Kuhi'', and Mira (Omicron Ceti) may have been called ''Kane''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Cetus (AK-77)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.
&quot;Cetus&quot; is the title of a ragtime piano composition by Tom Brier on the album &quot;Constellations&quot;.
