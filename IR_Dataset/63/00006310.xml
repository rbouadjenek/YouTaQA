'''Columbia University''' (also known as '''Columbia''', and officially as '''Columbia University in the City of New York''') is a [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[research university]] in [[New York City]]. Established in 1754 on the grounds of [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in [[Manhattan]], Columbia is the oldest institution of higher education in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the fifth-oldest institution of [[higher learning]] in the United States. It is one of nine [[colonial colleges]] founded prior to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], seven of which belong to the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/shaping_the_world/index.html|title=The Course of History|year=2004|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=November 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been ranked by numerous major education publications as among the top ten universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities|title=National University Rankings|date=|website=Usnews.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cwur.org/2018-19.php|title=CWUR 2018-2019 {{!}} Top Universities in the World|website=Cwur.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2018.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities|date=|website=Shanghairanking.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings|title=Best Global Universities Rankings|date=October 30, 2018|website=Usnews.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia was established as '''King's College''' by [[royal charter]] of [[George II of Great Britain]] in reaction to the founding of [[Princeton University]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCaughey2003&quot; /&gt; It was renamed '''Columbia College''' in 1784 following the [[American Revolution]], and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Jay]]. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] and renamed Columbia University.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html|title=A Brief History of Columbia|publisher=Columbia University |year=2011|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;studentaffairs.columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/admissions/university/campus/housing.php |title=Residential Life|website=Studentaffairs.columbia.edu|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the [[Province of New York]] began as early as 1704, at which time [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Colonel Lewis Morris]] wrote to the [[United Society Partners in the Gospel|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], the missionary arm of the [[Church of England]], persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCaughey2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Stand, Columbia : A History of Columbia University in the City of New York|last=McCaughey|first=Robert|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-231-13008-0|page=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 11, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the founding of the College of New Jersey (the present [[Princeton University]]) across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]] that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCaughey2003&quot; /&gt; In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the [[Church of England]], to direct the funds accrued by the [[state lottery]] towards the foundation of a college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Columbia|url=https://archive.org/details/columbia01keppgoog|last=Keppel|first=Fredrick Paul|year=1914|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews 1904&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Columbia University: 1754–1904|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorycolumbi02unkngoog|last=Matthews|first=Brander|author2=John Pine|author3=Harry Peck|author4=Munroe Smith|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan Company|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–10}} Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler 1912&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=An Official Guide to Columbia University|last=Butler|first=Nicholas Murray|year=1912|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Brief History of Columbia&quot; /&gt;

In 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by [[Myles Cooper]], a graduate of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and an ardent [[Tory]]. In the charged political climate of the [[American Revolution]], his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler 1912&quot; /&gt;{{rp|3}} The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the [[Continental Army]]. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their [[Evacuation Day (New York)|departure]] in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schecter|first=Barnet|title=The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8027-1374-2|url=https://archive.org/details/battlefornewyork00sche}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCullough|first=David|authorlink=David McCullough|title=1776|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4|title-link=1776 (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists were forced to abandon their King's College in New York, but some led by [[Charles Inglis (bishop)|Bishop Charles Inglis]] fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they founded [[King's-Edgehill School|King's Collegiate School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LP&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=12910 |date=August 7, 1787 |page=373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Revolution, the college turned to the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews 1904&quot;/&gt;{{rp|59}} The Legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed &quot;an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last2=|first2=|title=A History of Columbia University, 1754–1904|year=1904|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|id=|isbn=978-1-4021-3737-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created a [[Board of Regents]] to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the Legislature stipulated that &quot;the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Columbia&quot; /&gt; a reference to [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], an alternative name for America. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by [[John Jay]] and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a private board of 24 Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore 1846&quot;/&gt;{{rp|65–70}}

On May 21, 1787, [[William Samuel Johnson]], the son of [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]], was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the [[First Continental Congress]] and been chosen as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Samuel Johnson: A Maker of the Constitution|last=Groce|first=C.

Both President [[George Washington]] and Vice President [[John Adams]] attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews 1904&quot;/&gt;{{rp|74}}

In November 1813, the College agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore 1846&quot;/&gt;{{rp|53–60}} The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily [[Gothic Revival]] campus on 49th&amp;nbsp;Street and [[Madison Avenue]], where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|F.A.P.

During the late 20th century, the University underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university.

[[File:Columbia College Walk.jpg|thumb|College Walk]]
The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] on [[Seth Low]]'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning principles by the architects [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six [[city block]]s, or {{convert|32|acres|abbr=on}}, in [[Morningside Heights]], New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive [[Columbia University tunnels|tunnel system]] more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus.

The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as [[Butler Library]], is the largest single library in the [[Columbia University Library System]], and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as &quot;South Hall&quot; by the university's former President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] as expansion plans for [[Low Memorial Library]] stalled, the new library was funded by [[Edward Harkness]], benefactor of Yale's [[residential college]] system, and designed by his favorite architect, [[James Gamble Rogers]]. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is [[neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the [[Ionic order]] above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf|title=Butler Library: Self-Guided Tour|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, [[Columbia University Library System|Columbia's library system]] includes over 11.9 &amp;nbsp;million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.columbia.edu/about/facts.html|publisher=Columbia University|title=Libraries and Collections: Fast Facts|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm|publisher=American Library Association|title=The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue by sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] called ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' is centered on the front steps of [[Low Memorial Library]]. McKim, Mead &amp; White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing [[List of Latin phrases (S)|sapientia and doctrina]]. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a [[royal charter]] institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!20526~!0#focus|title=Alma Mater (sculpture)|author=Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a [[women's college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|title=The Myth of the College Sweetheart|author=Meredith Foster|date=February 11, 2011|work=The Eye|publisher=Columbia Spectator|accessdate=April 14, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307091227/http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|archivedate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/newrec/2423/tmpl/story.4.html|title=What Is the Mace?

&quot;The Steps&quot;, alternatively known as &quot;Low Steps&quot; or the &quot;Urban Beach&quot;, are a popular meeting area for Columbia students.

This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.columbia.edu/green-buildings|publisher=Columbia Environmental Stewardship|title=Projects: Green Buildings|accessdate=April 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508230555/http://www.environment.columbia.edu/green-buildings|archivedate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a [[Farmers' market|greenmarket]] where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grownyc.org/columbiagreenmarket|publisher=GrowNYC|title=Columbia Greenmarket|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/columbia-university|title=Columbia University Green Report Card|publisher=The College Sustainability Report Card|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia has been rated &quot;B+&quot; by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/columbia-university|title=Columbia University Green Report Card|publisher=College Sustainability Report Card|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia University received 40,203 applications for the class of 2022 (entering 2018) and a total of 2,214 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 5.5%, making Columbia the third most selective college in the United States behind [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as well as the second most selective college in the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2018/03/28/cc-seas-admit-rate-drops-to-record-low-55-percent/|title=CC, SEAS admit rate drops to record-low 5.5 percent - Columbia Daily Spectator|website=Columbiaspectator.com|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2012 college selectivity ranking by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]], which factors admission and yield rates among other criteria, Columbia was tied with [[Yale]], [[Caltech]] and [[MIT]] as the most selective colleges in the country.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report, Americas Best Rankings 2012, National University Rankings, Selectivity Ranking (the former is available only in the print edition and—for purchase—in the online premium edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.&lt;ref name=stat&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Aid Statistics|publisher=Columbia University|url=http://cc-seas.financialaid.columbia.edu/eligibility/facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University Tuition And Costs|url=http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg03_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=399|website=Collegedata.com|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million to $600 million donation from media billionaire alumnus [[John Kluge]] to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value will depend on the eventual value of Kluge's estate at the time of his death;{{needs update|date=July 2019}} however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sally |last=Beatty |date=April 11, 2007 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117624800578765660.html |title=Columbia to Get Huge Bequest from John Kluge
|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. {{As of|2008}}, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/education/11columbia.html|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Columbia University to Offer Financial Aid to More Students|date=March 11, 2008|accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] and the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the [[Common Application]]. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last [[Ivy League]] university to switch to the Common Application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/common-2/|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Columbia, Michigan and Connecticut Among 25 Colleges to Add Common Application|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2011|first=Jacques|last=Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars &quot;distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/scholars/named|title=The Named Scholars|website=Studentaffairs.columbia.edu|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by [[The New York Times]] as &quot;the first modern college application.&quot; The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gross, Jessica|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/who-made-that-college-application.html|title=Who Made That College Application?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 10, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is &quot;The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.&quot; The university's first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/|title=Columbia University Senate|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;senate.columbia.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Election packet |date=2017 |url=http://senate.columbia.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/topbar_pages/elections.html|title=Elections|website=Senate.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Presidents of Columbia University|The President of Columbia University]], who is selected by the Trustees in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate and who serves at the Trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the President in administering the University are the Provost, the Senior Executive Vice President, the Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences, several other vice presidents, the General Counsel, the Secretary of the University, and the deans of the Faculties, all of whom are appointed by the Trustees on the nomination of the President and serve at their pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia.edu&quot;/&gt; [[Lee C.

A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases—[[Grutter v Bollinger]] and [[Gratz v Bollinger]]—that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education. A leading First Amendment scholar, he is widely published on freedom of speech and press, and {{when|date=April 2012}} serves on the faculty of Columbia Law School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/president/docs/bio/index.html|title=Office of the President: Lee Bollinger|website=Columbia.edu|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Broadcasting====
[[File:Earl Hall Columbia University NYC.jpg|thumb|Earl Hall]]
Columbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate [[campus radio]] broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. [[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]].

Columbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against [[Rutgers University]] in the second football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student [[Maxie Long]] set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds.

{{Main|Columbia University protests of 1968}}

Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]]; this was seen by the protesters to be an act of aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring [[Harlem]]. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in [[the Pentagon]]'s weapons research think-tank, the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside [[Low Memorial Library|Low Library]], [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html &quot;Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion&quot;].

The protests achieved two of their stated goals. Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym, building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead. A popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by [[Princeton University]] for the expansion of its athletic facilities, but as [[Jadwin Gymnasium]] was already 50% complete by 1966 (when the Columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis.

[[Allan Bloom]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]],
believed that the protest efforts at Columbia were responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left.

Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]] and the Business School&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Disinvestment from South Africa#University campuses]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. university.

Broadly backed by student groups and many faculty members the Committee Against Investment in South Africa held teach-ins and demonstrations through the year focused on the trustees ties to the corporations doing business with South Africa. Trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in May 1978 in the takeover of the Graduate School of Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Demonstration at Columbia|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=May 2, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Student Sit-in at Columbia|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=May 2, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadinejad speech controversy===
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 13 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Students protest Ahmadinejad's invitation to speak at Columbia University]]

The [[School of International and Public Affairs]] extends invitations to heads of state and heads of government who come to New York City for the opening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, [[Iran]]ian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/07/09/ahmadinejad2.html|title=President Bollinger's Statement About President Ahmadinejad's Scheduled Appearance|date=September 19, 2007|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President [[Lee C. Bollinger]] tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/24/politics/main3292477.shtml|title=Candidates Speak Out On Ahmadinejad Visit|date=September 24, 2007|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.

During his speech, Ahmadinejad criticized [[Israel]]'s policies towards the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]; called for research on the historical accuracy of [[the Holocaust]]; raised questions as to who initiated the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]]; defended Iran's [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear power program]], criticizing the UN's policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the Middle East. In response to a question about Iran's [[Human rights in Iran|treatment]] of [[Women's rights in Iran|women]] and [[LGBT rights in Iran|homosexuals]], he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that &quot;In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country... In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who told you this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7010962.stm|title=Iran president in NY campus row|date=September 25, 2007|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter statement drew laughter from the audience. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office accused Columbia of accepting grant money from the [[Alavi Foundation]] to support faculty &quot;sympathetic&quot; to Iran's Islamic republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schools' Iran $ pipeline|first=Isabel|last=Vincent|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/columbia_rutgers_on_spy_group_gift_JOTKcEIJ5qgzRWPVeBxxNN|newspaper=New York Post|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ROTC controversy===
Beginning in 1969, during the Vietnam War, the university did not allow the U.S. military to have [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) programs on campus,&lt;ref&gt;Feith, David J., &quot;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGQ2Y2YyYTAxOTliMzQ3NjE2MmY1YzE3ZTI2YzIwMjQ= Duty, Honor, Country… and Columbia]&quot;, ''National Review'', September 15, 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917214649/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGQ2Y2YyYTAxOTliMzQ3NjE2MmY1YzE3ZTI2YzIwMjQ%3D |date=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/special_programs/army_rotc_ram_battal/affiliated_instituti_29928.asp Army ROTC at Fordham University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129032509/http://www.fordham.edu/academics/special_programs/army_rotc_ram_battal/affiliated_instituti_29928.asp |date=November 29, 2014 }} Accessed September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrotc.com/college-life/college/?recruiter_id=860|title=U.S. Air Force ROTC – College Life – College|publisher=Afrotc.com|accessdate=February 22, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205131845/http://www.afrotc.com/college-life/college/?recruiter_id=860|archivedate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;home.manhattan.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.manhattan.edu/~afrotc/CROSSTOWNS.htm|accessdate=January 14, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427060511/http://home.manhattan.edu/~afrotc/CROSSTOWNS.htm|archivedate=April 27, 2014|title=AFROTC Detachment 560, &quot;The Bronx Bombers&quot;, CROSS-TOWN SCHOOLS.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunymaritime.edu/NROTC/Command%20Information/Command.aspx/ NAVY ROTC IN NEW YORK CITY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618044804/http://www.sunymaritime.edu/NROTC/Command%20Information/Command.aspx/ |date=June 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a forum at the university during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election campaign]], both [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;home.manhattan.edu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGurn, William, &quot;[http://s.wsj.net/article/SB122273091416788171.html A Columbia Marine To Obama: Help!]&quot;, ''Wall Street Journal'', September 30, 2008, Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrotc.navy.mil/colleges-univers.cfm Colleges and Universities with NROTC Units] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802104405/https://www.nrotc.navy.mil/colleges-univers.cfm |date=August 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the debate, the President of the University, [[Lee C. Bollinger]], stated that he did not favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In April 2010 during [[Admiral]] [[Mike Mullen]]'s address at Columbia, President [[Lee C. Bollinger]] stated that the ROTC would be readmitted to campus if the admiral's plans for revoking the [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy were successful. In February 2011 during one of three town-hall meetings on the ROTC ban, former Army staff sergeant Anthony Maschek, a [[Purple Heart]] recipient for injuries sustained during his service in Iraq, was booed and hissed at by some students during his speech promoting the idea of allowing the ROTC on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Karni, Annie, &quot;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hero_unwelcome_Zi3u1fwtRpo87vXAiAQfSN]&quot;, ''New York Post'', February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 the Columbia University Senate voted to welcome the ROTC program back on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/02/columbia-rotc_n_843992.html], &quot;Huff Post College&quot;, April 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of the Navy [[Ray Mabus]] and Columbia University President Lee C.

=== Divestment from private prisons ===
In February 2014, after learning that the university had over $10 million invested in the private prison industry, a group of students delivered a letter President Bollinger's office requesting a meeting and officially launching the Columbia Prison Divest (CPD) campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/columbia-students-lee-bollinger-divest-prisons-now/|title=Columbia Students to Lee Bollinger: Divest From Prisons Now!|last=Sestanovich|first=Clare|date=March 20, 2015|work=The Nation|access-date=November 14, 2017|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|6|30|df=US}}, Columbia held investments in [[CoreCivic|Corrections Corporation of America]], the largest private prison company in the United States, as well as [[G4S]], the largest multinational security firm in the world.

==Traditions==
{{details|Columbia traditions}}

===Orgo Night===
In one of the school's longest-lasting traditions, begun in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 20, 1975 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/20/archives/columbia-cram-session-can-be-fun-too.html|title=Columbia Cram Session Can Be Fun, Too | access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at midnight before the Organic Chemistry exam—often the first day of final exams—the [[Columbia University Marching Band]] invaded and briefly occupied the main undergraduate reading room in [[Butler Library]] to distract and entertain studying students with some forty-five minutes of raucous jokes and music, beginning and ending with the singing of the school's fight song, &quot;[[Roar, Lion, Roar]]&quot;. After the main show before a crowd that routinely began filling the room well before the announced midnight start time, the Band led a procession to several campus locations, including the residential quadrangle of [[Barnard College]] for more music and temporary relief from the stress of last-minute studying.

In December 2016, following several years of complaints from students who said that some Orgo Night scripts and advertising posters were offensive to minority groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2014/12/11/if-you-go-orgo-night-youre-part-problem/| title=If you go to Orgo Night, you're part of the problem | work=Columbia Daily Spectator |access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a ''New York Times'' article on the Band's crass treatment of sexual assault on campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Taylor | first=Kate | title=This Year, Columbia Event Finds Joke Fodder in Sexual Assault Debate | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 9, 2015 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/nyregion/columbia-bands-traditional-show-includes-jokes-about-sexual-assault-debate.html | access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
University administrators banned the Marching Band from performing its Orgo Night show in the traditional Butler Library location. Protests and allegations of censorship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2016/12/13/marching-band-denied-access-butler-library-orgo-night|title=University denies marching band access to Butler Library for Orgo Night – Columbia Daily Spectator|last=|first=|date=|website=Columbiaspectator.com|access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed, but University President [[Lee Bollinger]] said that complaints and publicity about the shows had &quot;nothing to do with&quot; the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2016/12/15/bollinger-defends-universitys-decision-ban-orgo-night-butler|title=Bollinger defends University's decision to ban Orgo Night from Butler – Columbia Daily Spectator|website=Columbiaspectator.com|access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Band instead performed—at midnight, as usual—outside the main entrance of Butler Library.

The Band's official alumni organization, the Columbia University Band Alumni Association, registered protests with the administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiabandalumni.org/orgo-night/ | title=Orgo Night! |website=Columbiabandalumni.org |access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ad hoc group of alumni writing under the name &quot;A.

For Orgo Night December 2017, Band members quietly infiltrated the Library with their musical instruments during the evening and popped up at midnight to perform the show inside despite the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/40269/|title=How Columbia's politically incorrect marching band outwitted the administration's censorship attempt|last=Piper|first=Greg|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=The College Fix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the spring 2018 exam period, the administration warned the group's leaders against a repeat and restated the injunction, warning of sanctions; the Band again staged its Orgo Night show in front of the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=May 3, 201811:06 pm 1 Comments |url=http://bwog.com/2018/05/03/orgo-night-spring-2018-liveblog/ |title=Orgo Night Spring 2018 Liveblog – Bwog |publisher=Bwog.com |date=2018-05-03 |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree-Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies===
[[File:Collegewalk2.jpg|thumb|Tree-Lighting at College Walk]]
The campus Tree-Lighting Ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by ''a cappella'' groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|author=Jason Hollander|publisher=Columbia University News|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], but lapsed before being revived by University President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as [[Continental Army]] soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' by [[Clement Clarke Moore]] and ''[[Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus]]'' by [[Francis Pharcellus Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollander|first=Jason|date=December 3, 1999|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|work=Columbia News|accessdate=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Varsity Show===
[[The Varsity Show]] is an annual musical written by and for students and was established in 1894, making it one of Columbia's oldest traditions. Past writers and directors have included Columbians [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], [[Lorenz Hart]], [[I.A.L. Diamond]], [[Herman Wouk]] and [[Eric Garcetti]].
