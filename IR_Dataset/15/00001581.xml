'''Aldine Press''' was the [[printing]] office started by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494 in [[Venice]], from which were issued the celebrated Aldine editions of the classics (Latin and Greek masterpieces plus a few more modern works). The first book that was dated and printed under his name appeared in 1495.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldus and His Dream Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barolini|first1=Helen|title=Aldus and His Dream Book|date=1992|publisher=Italica Press, Inc.|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-934977-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aldine Press is famous in the history of [[typography]], among other things, for the introduction of [[italics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Evolution of Type&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seddon|first1=Tony|title=The Evolution of Type|date=2015|publisher=Firefly Books Ltd. 2015|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-77085-504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press was the first to issue printed books in the small [[octavo (book)|octavo]] size, similar to that of a modern paperback, and like that intended for portability and ease of reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldus and His Dream Book&quot; /&gt;{{rp|82-84}} According to Curt Buhler, the press issued 132 books during twenty years of activity under Aldus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldus and His Dream Book&quot; /&gt; After Aldus’ death in 1515 the press was continued by his wife, Maria and her father, Andrea Torresani, until his son, Paulus Manutius (1512–1574) took over. His grandson [[Aldus Manutius the Younger]] then ran the firm until his death in 1597. Today, the antique books printed by the Aldine Press in Venice are referred to as ''Aldines''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The First Five Hundred Years&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bühler|first1=Curt F.|title=Aldus Manutius: The First Five Hundred Years|journal=The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America|date=1950|volume=44|issue=3|pages=205–215|doi=10.1086/pbsa.44.3.24298605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press enjoyed a [[Printing patent|monopoly]] of works printed in Greek in the Republic of Venice, effectively giving it copyright protection. Protection outside the Republic was more problematic, however. The firm maintained an agency in Paris, but its commercial success was affected by many counterfeit editions, produced in Lyons and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice&quot; /&gt;

==Beginnings==
[[File:Title page of Herodotus' history of the Greek and Persian Wars 1502.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italian language|Italian]] translation of [[Herodotus' Histories]] by Count [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], published in [[Venice]], Aldine Press in 1502 (1533?).]]
[[Aldus Manutius]], the founder of the Aldine Press, was originally a humanist scholar and teacher. Manutius met Andrea Torresani, who had acquired publishing equipment from [[Nicolas Jenson|Nicholas Jensen]]'s widow. The Aldine Press was originally owned half by Pier Francesco Barbarigo, the nephew of the current doge of the time, [[Agostino Barbarigo]], and the other half by Andrea Torresani. Manutius owned one fifth of Torresani's share. Manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing, leaving financial and operating concerns to Barbarigo and Torresani. In 1496, Aldus established his own location in a building called the ''Thermae'' in the [[San Polo|Sestiere di San Polo]] on the campo Sant'Agostin&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Knoops|first=Johannes|title=In Search of Aldus Manutius a campo Sant'Agostin|publisher=Damocle|year=2018|isbn=978-88-943223-2-3|location=Venice, Italy|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/home/published/in_search_of_aldus_damocle|title=In Search of Aldus Manutius a campo Sant'Agostin|last=Knoops|first=Johannes|date=|website=ISSUU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; today ''civico numero'' 2343 San Polo on the c''alle della Chiesa'', now the location of the restaurant ''Due Colonne''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Though there are two commemorative plaques on the building ''civico numero'' 2311 ''Rio Terà Secondo,'' historians regard them to be erroneously placed based on contemporaneous letters addressed to Manutius;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Castellani|first=Carlo|title=La stampa in Venezia dalla sua origine alla morte di Aldo Manuzio senior|publisher=F.

It was demolished in 1873 and now covered by a bank building in the Venice square, ''Campo Manin.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;  

==Accomplishments of the Aldine Press==
The press was started by Manutius based on his love of classics and the need of preservation of Hellenic studies. At first the press printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin classics. Manutius  also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books, used by scholars wanting to learn Greek to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Printing Press as an Agent of Change&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenstein|first1=Elizabeth L.|title=The Printing Press as an Agent of Change|url=https://archive.org/details/printingpressas01eise|url-access=registration|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] claimed that the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as those by the Aldine Press secured it. [[Erasmus]] was one of the scholars learned in Greek with whom the Aldine Press partnered in order to provide accurately translated text.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Printing Press as an Agent of Change&quot; /&gt;{{rp|221}} The Aldine Press also expanded into current languages, mainly Italian and French.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Aldine Studies&quot; /&gt;[[File:Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012]]
===Humanist typefaces===
Aldus Manutius hired [[Francesco Griffo]] to create a typeface designed to reproduce the written hand of the humanists. This resulted in the first roman face adapted and known today as [[italic type]]. It was first used to print [[Pietro Bembo|Cardinal Pietro Bembo's]] ''De Aetna'' in 1495. Before this time print publishing used block letters, the look of handwriting as print was a new phenomenon and, try as he might to prevent it, Manutius' typeface was illegally copied, spreading through Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Evolution of Type&quot; /&gt;

===Aldus Manutius the Elder's portable books===
In 1505 Manutius produced plain texts in useful form, using the term ''[[enchiridion]]'', meaning a manual or small, hand-held weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Aldine Studies&quot; /&gt; The [[octavo]] was the first appearance of the editio minor, a straightforward text, established as well as the editor can manage. Although these new, portable books were not cheap, the books of the Aldine Press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment that large volumes of text and commentary demanded during this era. The editio minor, instead, brought financial and logistical benefits to those interested in the classics. An individual didn't have to go to the book, rather now the book came along with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Aldine Studies&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1-7}}

===Imprint and motto===
In 1501, Aldus used as his publisher's device the image of a [[dolphin]] wrapped around an [[anchor]].&lt;ref&gt;H. George Fletcher, ''In praise of Aldus Manutius'' (New York: Morgan Library, 1995), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The dolphin and anchor device owed its origins most immediately to Pietro Bembo. Aldus was to tell Erasmus six years later that Bembo had given him a silver coin minted under the Emperor Vesparian and bearing an image of this device&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mortimer|first1=Ruth|title=Catalogue of books and Manuscripts. Part II. Italian 16th Century Books. 2 vols.|date=1974|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the dolphin and anchor on the coin came with a saying, &quot;Festina Lente&quot;, meaning &quot;make haste slowly&quot;. This would become the motto for the Aldine Press.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Aldine Studies&quot; /&gt;

==The Aldine Press after 1515==
[[Aldus Manutius]] the Elder died on February 6, 1515. After his death the firm was run by Andrea Torresani and his daughter, Maria, the widow of Aldus Manutius. The Aldine Press was named in 1508 as &quot;In the House of Aldus and Andrea Torresano&quot; which kept this name until 1529. In 1533, [[Paulus Manutius]] managed the firm, starting it up again and changing its name to &quot;Heirs of Aldus and Andrea Torresano&quot;. In 1539 the imprint changed to &quot;Sons of Aldo Manuzio&quot;. In 1567 [[Aldus Manutius the Younger]] continued the business until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsmid|first1=Edmund|title=A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice: 3 Volumes|date=1887|publisher=Privately Published|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
