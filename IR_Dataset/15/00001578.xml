'''Alcamenes''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλκαμένης}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] of [[Lemnos]] and [[Athens]],  who flourished in the 2nd half of the 5th century BC. He was a younger contemporary of [[Phidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[Hephaestus]] and an [[Aphrodite of the Gardens|Aphrodite &quot;of the Gardens&quot;]] were conspicuous.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alcamenes|volume=1|pages=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'' V. 10. 8&lt;/ref&gt; that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Pausanias&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'' I. 8. 4&lt;/ref&gt; also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the [[Athenian agora]], which some have related to the [[Ares Borghese]].  However, the temple of Ares to which he refers had only been moved from [[Acharnes]] and re-sited in the Agora in [[Augustus]]'s time, and statues known to derive from Alcamenes' statue show the god in a [[breastplate]],&lt;ref&gt;One sculpture of Ares and Aphrodite is depicted [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=20221 in this relief]&lt;/ref&gt; so the identification of Alcamenes' Ares with the Ares Borghese is not secure.

At [[Pergamum]] there was discovered in 1903 a Hellenistic copy of the head of the Hermes &quot;Propylaeus&quot; of Alcamenes.&lt;ref&gt;''Athenische Mittheilungen'', 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;180&lt;/ref&gt; As, however, the deity is represented in a [[Neo-Attic]], archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

It is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the [[Parthenon]], in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Phidias.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in [[Athens]] after the departure of Phidias for [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.
