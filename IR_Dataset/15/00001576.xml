Many of the Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts in which he was directly involved took place in the Indian Ocean, in the Persian Gulf regions for control of the trade routes, and on the coasts of India. It was his military brilliance in these initial campaigns against the much larger Ottoman Empire and its allies that enabled Portugal to become the first global empire in history.&lt;ref&gt;''China Goes to Sea: Maritime Transformation in Comparative Historical Perspective'' edited by Andrew Erickson, Lyle J.

==Early life==
[[File:Coat of arms of Albuquerque (antiga).svg|upright|thumb|Coat of arms of Albuquerque]]

Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in [[Vila Franca de Xira|Alhandra]], near [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Crowley|author2=Geoffrey Parker|title=Albuquerque, Afonso de|work=The Reader's Companion to Military History|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of [[Afonso V of Portugal]], where he befriended Prince John, the future King [[John II of Portugal]].{{sfn|Stephens|1897|p=}}

Afonso's early training is described by Diogo Barbosa Machado:
''“D. Alfonso de Albuquerque, surnamed the Great, by reason of the heroic deeds wherewith he filled Europe with admiration, and Asia with fear and trembling, was born in the year 1453, in the Estate called, for the loveliness of its situation, the Paradise of the Town of Alhandra, six leagues distant from Lisbon. He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Villaverde, and of D. Leonor de Menezes, daughter of D. Álvaro Gonçalves de Athayde, Count of Atouguia, and of his wife D. Guiomar de Castro, and corrected this injustice of nature by climbing to the summit of every virtue, both political and moral. He was educated in the Palace of the King D. Afonso V, in whose palaestra he strove emulously to become the rival of that African Mars”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jayne&quot;&gt;''Vasco Da Gama'', By Kingsley Garland Jayne; pp. 78–79, Taylor &amp; Francis (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military service==
Afonso served 10 years in North Africa, where he gained military experience in fierce campaigns against Muslim powers and Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

In 1471, under the command of [[Afonso V of Portugal]], he was present at the conquest of [[Tangier]] and [[Conquest of Asilah|Arzila]] in [[Morocco]],&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13157/Afonso-de-Albuquerque-the-Great|title=Afonso de Albuquerque|accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving there as an officer for some years. In 1476 he accompanied [[John II of Portugal|Prince John]] in wars against Castile, including the [[Battle of Toro]]. He participated in the campaign on the Italian peninsula in 1480 to rescue [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] from the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] that ended in victory.{{sfn|Bandelier|1907}} On his return in 1481, when Prince John was crowned as King John II, Afonso was made [[Master of the Horse]] for his distinguished exploits, chief [[equerry]] (''estribeiro-mor'') to the King, a post which he held throughout John's reign (1481–95).&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jayne&quot;/&gt; In 1489 he returned to military campaigns in North Africa, as commander of defense in the [[Graciosa fortress]], an island in the river Luco near the city of [[Larache]], and in 1490 was part of the guard of King John II, returning to Arzila in 1495, where his younger brother Martim died fighting by his side.

Afonso made his mark under the stern John II, and won military campaigns in Africa and the Mediterranean sea, yet Asia is where he would make his greatest impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jayne&quot;/&gt;

===First expedition to India, 1503===
{{main|5th Portuguese India Armada (Albuquerque, 1503)}}
When King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] was enthroned, he showed some reticence towards Afonso, a close friend of his dreaded predecessor and seventeen years his senior. Eight years later, on 6 April 1503, after a long military career and at a mature age, Afonso was sent on his first expedition to India together with his cousin Francisco de Albuquerque. Each commanded three ships, sailing with [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] and [[Nicolau Coelho]]. They engaged in several battles against the forces of the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode) and succeeded in establishing the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King]] of [[Kochi, India|Cohin]] (''Cohim'', Kochi) securely on his throne. In return, the King gave them permission to build the Portuguese [[Fort Emmanuel|fort ''Immanuel'' (Fort Kochi)]] and establish trade relations with [[Quilon]] (''Coulão'', [[Kollam]]). This laid the foundation for the eastern [[Portuguese Empire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Second expedition to India, 1506===
[[File:Cantinomap redsea persiangulf.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] showing the [[Red Sea]] with [[Socotra]] island (red) and the [[Persian Gulf]] (blue) with the [[Strait of Hormuz]] ([[Cantino planisphere]], 1502)]]
Afonso returned home in July 1504, and was well received by King Manuel I. After he assisted with the creation of a strategy for the Portuguese efforts in the east, King Manuel entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen sailing for India in early 1506 headed by [[Tristão da Cunha]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Their aim was to conquer [[Socotra]] and build a fortress there, hoping to close the trade in the Red Sea.
Afonso went as &quot;chief-captain for the [[Arabian Peninsula|Coast of Arabia]]&quot;, sailing under da Cunha's orders until reaching Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo do Couto, ''Décadas da Ásia'', década X, livro I&lt;/ref&gt; He carried a sealed letter with a secret mission ordered by the King: after fulfilling the first mission, he was to replace the first viceroy of India, [[Francisco de Almeida]], whose term ended two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;&gt;''Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415–1580'', pp. 239–260, Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. Shafer, George Davison Winius&lt;/ref&gt; Before departing, he legitimized a natural son born in 1500, and made his will.

====First conquest of Socotra and Ormuz, 1507====
{{main|Capture of Ormuz (1507)}}
The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In [[Juan de Nova Island|Mozambique Channel]], they rescued Captain [[João da Nova]], who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the ''[[Frol de la mar]]'', joined da Cunha's fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Afonso de Albuquerque|author2=Walter de Gray Birch|title=Commentaries of the Great Afonso – 4 Vols.|year=2000|isbn=978-81-206-1514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Malindi]], da Cunha sent envoys to [[Ethiopia]], which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest João Gomes, João Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for [[Socotra]]; from there, Afonso managed to land them in [[Cape Guardafui|Filuk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stones&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J. J. Hespeler-Boultbee|title=A Story in Stones: Portugal's Influence on Culture and Architecture in the Highlands of Ethiopia, 1493–1634|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Nz5OqKWeTwC&amp;pg=PA178|year=2006|publisher=CCB Publishing|isbn=978-0-9781162-1-7|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Portuguese Castle (Hormuz).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of the Conception]], [[Hormuz Island]], [[Iran]]]]
At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristão da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese [[Siege of Cannanore (1507)|besieged at Cannanore]], while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] in July 1507, and [[Khor Fakkan]], accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and [[Sohar]]. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon [[Capture of Ormuz (1507)|captured the city]], which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king. 
[[File:Afonso de Albuquerque Lisboa.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Afonso de Albuquerque, symbolically standing on a stack of weapons, referencing his reply in Hormuz]]
Hormuz was then a tributary state of Shah Ismail of Persia. In a famous episode, shortly after its conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead. He ordered them to be given a stock of cannonballs, arrows and weapons, retorting that &quot;such was the currency struck in Portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of King Manuel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In Portuguese: ''[...]mandando-lhe dizer que aquela era a moeda que se lavrava em Portugal pera pagar páreas àqueles que as pediam aos lugares e senhorios del-rei Dom Manuel, rei de Portugal e senhor das Índias e do reino de Ormuz.'' in Fernão Lopes de Castanheda (1554)
[https://archive.org/stream/historiadodescob01castuoft#page/210/mode/2up ''Historia do descobrimento e conquista de India pelos Portugueses''] Volume II, pg.211&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brás de Albuquerque, it was Shah Ismael who coined the term &quot;Lion of the seas&quot;, addressing Albuquerque as such. Afonso began building the [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of Victory]] (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Laraine Newhouse|last=Carter|title=Persian Gulf States: Chapter 1B. The Gulf During the Medieval Period|work=Countries of the World|publisher=Bureau Development, Inc.| date=1 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; engaging his men of all ranks in the work.

However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.

====Arrest at Cannanore, 1509====
Afonso arrived at [[Kannur|Cannanore]] on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] in December 1508, where he opened before the viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida, the sealed letter which he had received from the King, and which named as governor to succeed Almeida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afonso, like many others since then, took office as governor: when appointing the Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, the King promised not to appoint another in his lifetime, a vote of confidence in contradiction with the short term of three years he gave him, that may be due to the great fears about the sharing of power that this position represented.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the first months of 1508, the son of D. Francisco de Almeida, [[Lourenço de Almeida]], died in dramatic circumstances at the [[Battle of Chaul]] and there are reports that the viceroy, an enlightened and incorruptible ruler, turned vindictive and cruel.&lt;/ref&gt;
The viceroy, supported by the officers who had abandoned Afonso at Ormuz, had a matching royal order, but declined to yield, protesting that his term ended only in January and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] fleet of [[Mirocem]], refusing Afonso's offer to fight him himself. Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time, Afonso refused approaches from opponents of the Viceroy, who encouraged him to seize power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fernão Lopes de Castanheda|title=Historia do Descobrimento e Conquista da India pelos Portugueses|url=https://archive.org/details/historiadodesco08castgoog|year=1833|publisher=Typographia Rollandiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 1509, Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and the [[Mahmud Begada|Sultan of Gujarat]], regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son. His victory was decisive: the Ottomans and Mamluks abandoned the Indian Ocean, easing the way for Portuguese rule there for the next century. In August, after a petition from Afonso's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira claiming him unfit for governance, Afonso was sent in custody to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Kannur|Cannanore]].{{sfn|Stephens|1897|pp=61–62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. S. Whitewayy|title=The Rise of Portuguese Power in India (1497–1550)|year=1995|isbn=978-81-206-0500-8|page=126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There he remained under what he considered to be imprisonment.

In September 1509, Sequeira tried to establish contact with the [[Malacca sultanate|Sultan of Malacca]] but failed, leaving behind 19 Portuguese prisoners.

==Governor of Portuguese India, 1509–1515==
Afonso was released after three months' confinement, on the arrival at Cannanore of the [[Marshal of Portugal]] with a large fleet.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ricardo Bonalume|last=Neto|title=Lightning rod of Portuguese India|work=MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History|publisher=Cowles Enthusiast Media Spring|date=1 April 2002|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Portuguese Marshal was the most important Portuguese noble ever to visit India and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and 3,000 men sent by the King to defend Afonso's rights, and to take [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].&lt;ref&gt;Neto, Ricardo Bonalume. ''MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History'' p. 68. Cowles Enthusiast Media Spring. 1 April 2002 (Page news on 20 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1509, Afonso became the second Governor of the State of India, a position he would hold until his death. Almeida having returned home in 1510,&lt;ref&gt;Almeida returned to Portugal five days later, but died in a skirmish with the [[Khoikhoi]] near the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;/ref&gt; Afonso speedily showed the energy and determination of his character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andaya&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara Watson Andaya|author2=Leonard Y. Andaya|title=A History of Malaysia|year=1984|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|isbn=978-0-312-38121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to dominate the Muslim world and control the [[Spice trade]].&lt;ref name=Andaya/&gt;

Initially King Manuel I and his council in Lisbon tried to distribute the power, outlining three areas of jurisdiction in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt; In 1509, the nobleman [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] was sent with a fleet to Southeast Asia, to seek an agreement with [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]] of [[Malacca]], but failed and returned to Portugal. To Jorge de Aguiar was given the region between the Cape of Good Hope and Gujarat. He was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos, but left for Cochin and then for Portugal, leaving his fleet to Afonso.

===Conquest of Goa, 1510===
{{Main|Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)}}
[[File:&quot;Plan de Goa&quot;, in Histoire générale des voyages,1750.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicts the aftermath of the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]], from the forces of [[Yusuf Adil Shah]].]]
In January 1510, obeying the orders from the King and aware of the absence of [[Zamorin]], Afonso advanced on Calicut. The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt;

Soon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala&quot;&gt;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498–1763&quot; pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala&quot;/&gt; So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal &quot;guest&quot; of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.

A first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.

Three months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt; and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Robert (1824)&lt;/ref&gt; Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief &quot;[[Aguazil]]&quot; of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala&quot;/&gt; He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.
[[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]]
In Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history|year=1990|isbn=978-81-7022-226-2|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or &quot;esfera&quot;), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse. Gold cruzados or ''manueis'', silver ''esferas'' and ''alf-esferas'', and bronze &quot;leais&quot; were issued.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque&quot;, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado|title=Glossário Luso-Asiático|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XX69ZwEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA382|year=1982|publisher=Buske Verlag|isbn=978-3-87118-479-6|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mint was established at Malacca in 1511.

Albuquerque founded at Goa the ''Hospital Real de Goa'' or Royal Hospital of Goa, by the Church of Santa Catarina. Upon hearing that the doctors were extorting the sickly with excessive fees, Albuquerque summoned them, declaring that &quot;You charge a physicians' pay and don't know what disease the men who serve our lord the King suffer from. Thus, I want to teach you what is it that they die from&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar Correia ''Lendas da Índia'', book II tome II, part I pp.440–441, 1923 Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and put them to work building the city walls all day till nightfall before releasing them.&lt;ref&gt;Germano de Sousa (2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvg_mAEACAAJ&amp;dq=Hist%C3%B3ria+da+Medicina+Portuguesa+Durante+a+Expans%C3%A3o&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2-NvPqv7RAhVJ0xoKHTXJAMAQ6AEIGTAA ''História da Medicina Portuguesa Durante a Expansão'' ] Circulo de Leitores, Lisbon&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constant attacks, Goa became the center of Portuguese India, with the conquest triggering the compliance of neighbouring kingdoms: the [[Sultan of Gujarat]] and the [[Zamorin]] of Calicut sent embassies, offering alliances and local grants to fortify.

Afonso then used Goa to secure the [[Spice trade]] in favor of Portugal and sell [[Persia]]n [[horse]]s to [[Vijayanagara]] and Hindu princes in return for their assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Afonso-de-Albuquerque-the-Great|title=Afonso de Albuquerque, the Great &amp;#124; Portuguese conqueror &amp;#124; Britannica.com|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest of Malacca, 1511===
[[File:Malacca in 1511.png|thumb|Malacca, with A Famosa, depicted by Albuquerque's scrivener, [[Gaspar Correia]]. ]]
{{main|Capture of Malacca (1511)}}
Afonso explained to his armies why the Portuguese wanted to capture Malacca:
:&quot;''The King of Portugal has often commanded me to go to the Straits, because...this was the best place to intercept the trade which the Moslems...carry on in these parts. So it was to do Our Lord’s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route.... I am very sure that, if this Malacca trade is taken out of their hands, Cairo and Mecca will be completely lost.''&quot; (The Commentaries of the Great Afonso de Albuquerque)
[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]]]]
In February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Araújo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt; Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.

After a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tomé Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.

Afonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[António de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt; Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosworth2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&amp;pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Afonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;/&gt; building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as &quot;[[A Famosa]]&quot; ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for &quot;The stone the builders rejected&quot;, from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22–23) on the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capitão geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

He settled the Portuguese administration, reappointing Rui de Araújo as [[factor (agent)|factor]], a post assigned before his 1509 arrest, and appointing rich merchant Nina Chatu to replace the previous ''[[bendahara]]'', representative of the ''[[Kafir]]'' people and adviser. Besides assisting in the governance of the city and first Portuguese coinage, he provided the junks for several diplomatic missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Teotónio R. de Souza|title=Indo-Portuguese History: Old Issues, New Questions|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yjXJOFEIIMkC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1985|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Afonso arrested and had executed the powerful Javanese merchant Utimuti Raja who, after being appointed to a position in the Portuguese administration as representative of the Javanese population, had maintained contacts with the exiled royal family.

Afonso arranged for the shipping of many [[Órfãs d'El-Rei]]&lt;ref&gt;Orfas del Rei, literally translated as &quot;Orphans of the King&quot;, were Portuguese orphan girls sent to overseas colonies to populate them {{cite book|last=McDonogh|first=Gary|title=Iberian Worlds|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nxy-aa1uklUC&amp;pg=PA183|edition=illustrated|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94771-8|page=167}}, 336 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkissian|first=Margaret|title=D'Albuquerque's Children: Performing Tradition in Malaysia's Portuguese Settlement|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fRHYk6Izi0IC&amp;pg=PA21|edition=illustrated|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73498-9|page=21}}, 219 pages&lt;/ref&gt; to Portuguese Malacca.

====Shipwreck on the ''Flor de la mar'', 1511====
On 20 November 1511 Afonso sailed from Malacca to the coast of Malabar on the old ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] that had served to support the conquest of Malacca. Despite its unsound condition, he used it to transport the treasure amassed in the conquest, given its large capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt; He wanted to give the court of King Manuel a show of Malaccan treasures. There were also the offers from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (Thailand) to the King of Portugal and all his own fortune. On the voyage the ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' was wrecked in a storm, and Afonso barely escaped drowning.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;/&gt;

===Missions from Malacca===

====Embassies to Pegu, Sumatra and Siam, 1511====
Most Muslim and Gujarati merchants having fled the city, Afonso invested in diplomatic efforts demonstrating generosity to Southeast Asian merchants, like the Chinese, to encourage good relations with the Portuguese. Trade and diplomatic missions were sent to continental kingdoms: Rui Nunes da Cunha was sent to [[Pegu]] (Burma), from where King Binyaram sent back a friendly emissary to Kochi in 1514&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Teixeira, &quot;The Portuguese missions in Malacca and Singapore (1511–1958)&quot;, Agência Geral do Ultramar 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pires|first=Tomé|title=Suma Oriental of Tome Pires – 2 Vols.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC|year=1990|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0535-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sumatra]], Sumatran kings of Kampar and Indragiri sending emissaries to Afonso accepting the new power, as vassal states of Malacca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Donald F.

He was one of the Portuguese who had been arrested in Malacca, having gathered knowledge about the culture of the region. There he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between the kingdom of Portugal and the court of the King of Siam [[Ramathibodi II]], returning with a Siamese envoy bearing gifts and letters to Afonso and the King of Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lach&quot;/&gt;

====Expedition to the &quot;spice islands&quot; (Maluku islands), 1512====
[[File:Ternate.JPG|thumb|Depiction of [[Ternate]] with São João Baptista Fort, built in 1522]]
In November, after having secured Malacca and learning the location of the then secret &quot;[[Maluku Islands|spice islands]]&quot;, Afonso sent three ships to find them, led by trusted [[António de Abreu]] with deputy commander [[Francisco Serrão]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;&gt;A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] sailors were recruited to guide them through [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] and the [[Ambon Island]] to [[Banda Islands]], where they arrived in early 1512.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton 1999 5 and 7&quot;&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7;{{cite book|last=Milton|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Milton|title=Nathaniel's Nutmeg|year=1999|publisher=Sceptre|location=London|isbn=978-0-340-69676-7|pages=5, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There they remained for a month, buying and filling their ships with [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s. António de Abreu then sailed to Amboina whilst Serrão sailed towards the Moluccas, but he was shipwrecked near Seram. [[Sultanate of Ternate|Sultan Abu Lais of Ternate]] heard of their stranding, and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, brought them to Ternate in 1512 where they were permitted to build a fort on the island, the ''{{Interlanguage link|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate|pt|vertical-align=sup}}'', built in 1522.

====China expeditions, 1513====
In early 1513, [[Jorge Álvares]], sailing on a mission under Afonso's orders, was allowed to land in [[Lintin Island]], on the [[Pearl River Delta]] in southern China. Soon after, Afonso sent [[Rafael Perestrello]] to southern China, seeking trade relations with the [[Ming dynasty]]. In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tomé was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).&lt;ref&gt;Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett. (1998). ''The Cambridge History of China; Volume 7–8''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-24333-5}} (Hardback edition). p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Portuguese relations with China became normalized again by the 1540s and in 1557 a permanent Portuguese base at [[Macau]] in southern China was established with consent from the Ming court.

===Return to Cochin and Goa===
[[File:Alfonso de Albuquerque II, governor of India.jpg|thumb|Afonso de Albuquerque as governor of India]]
Afonso returned from Malacca to Cochin, but could not sail to Goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of [[Ismael Adil Shah]], the Sultan of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]], commanded by [[Rasul Khan]] and his countrymen. During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.

While at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, &quot;all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by António Baião (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fernão Lopes (soldier)|Fernão Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.

===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513===
In December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought &quot;[[Prester John]]&quot; envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge/page/n102 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.

In February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris. He was under orders to secure that channel for Portugal. Socotra had proved ineffective to control the Red Sea entrance and was abandoned, and Afonso's hint that [[Massawa]] could be a good Portuguese base might have been influenced by Mateus' reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt;

Knowing that the Mamluks were preparing a second fleet at [[Suez]], he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived in [[Aden]], and accordingly [[Siege of Aden|laid siege to the city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. D. D. Newitt|title=A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion, 1400–1668|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vpteLQcx6J4C&amp;pg=PA87|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-23979-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aden was a fortified city, but although he had scaling ladders they broke during the chaotic attack. After half a day of fierce battle Afonso was forced to retreat. He cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], with the first European fleet to have sailed this route. He attempted to reach [[Jeddah]], but the winds were unfavourable and so he sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island in May, until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced him to retreat. In August 1513, after a second attempt to reach Aden, he returned to India with no substantial results. In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], he wrote to King Manuel of the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile]] river to render the whole country barren.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Perhaps most tellingly, he intended to steal the body of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], and hold it for ransom until all Muslims had left the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew James McGregor|title=A Military History of Modern Egypt: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War|year=2006|publisher=Praeger Publishers|isbn=978-0-275-98601-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/militaryhistoryo00andr/page/20 20]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/militaryhistoryo00andr/page/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=The Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque, Second Viceroy of India|year=1999|publisher=Elibron Classics|isbn=978-1-4021-9508-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Albuquerque's expedition failed to reach Suez, such an incursion into the Red Sea by a Christian fleet for the first time in history stunned the Muslim world, and panic spread in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Crowley (2016): ''Conquerors: How Portugal Seized the Indian Ocean and Forges the First Global Empire''] p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submission of Calicut===
[[File:Portuguese fort at Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|The Portuguese fort at Calicut]]
Albuquerque achieved during his term a favourable end to hostilities between the Portuguese and the Zamorin of Calicut, which had lasted ever since the massacre of the Portuguese in Calicut in 1502. As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Sanceau (1936).

===Administration and diplomacy in Goa, 1514===
[[File:Dürer's Rhinoceros, 1515.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]], [[woodcut]] (1515)]]
[[File:Codice Casanatense Portuguese Nobleman and Christian Indian.jpg|thumb|Portuguese and Christian women of India, depicted in the [[Códice Casanatense]]]]
With peace concluded, in 1514 Afonso devoted himself to governing Goa and receiving embassies from Indian governors, strengthening the city and encouraging marriages of Portuguese men and local women. At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or &quot;married men&quot;) who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except &quot;[[Sati (practice)|sati]]&quot;, the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).

In March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Tristão da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.

In early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]]. The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including an [[Indian rhinoceros]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Afonso sent the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambe&quot;&gt;[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html História do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht Dürer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155010/http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html |date=18 February 2009 }}, Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{in lang|pt}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1515, Manuel sent it as a gift, the famous [[Dürer's Rhinoceros]] to Pope Leo X. Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]].

===Conquest of Ormuz and Illness===
[[File:Afonso de Albuquerque (with Santiago cloak).jpg|thumb|upright|Afonso de Albuquerque as Governor of India]]
In 1513, at Cannanore, Afonso was visited by a [[Persia]]n ambassador from Shah [[Ismail I]], who had sent ambassadors to Gujarat, [[Ormuz]] and Bijapur. The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.

At the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus &quot;freeing&quot; the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622.&lt;ref name=&quot;intlhistory.blogspot.com.au&quot;&gt;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;http://intlhistory.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/alfonso-de-albuquerque-history-figure.html&lt;/ref&gt; At Ormuz, Afonso met with Miguel Ferreira, returning with rich presents and an ambassador, carrying a letter from the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Holland Rose |author2=Ernest Alfred Benians |author3=Arthur Percival Newton |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year=1928|publisher=CUP Archive|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts, receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress, while becoming increasingly ill. His illness was reported as early as September 1515.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muchembled|first1=Robert|last2=Monter|first2=William|title=Cultural Exchange in Early Modern Europe|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84548-9|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1515, he embarked back to Goa, a journey he would not live to complete.

====Death====
Afonso's life ended on a bitter note, with a painful and ignominious close. At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albuquerque&quot;&gt;Albuquerque, Brás de (1774). ''Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque, parte IV'', pp. 200–206&lt;/ref&gt;

While on his return voyage from Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, near the harbor of [[Chaul]], he received news of a Portuguese fleet arriving from Europe, bearing dispatches announcing that he was to be replaced by his personal foe, [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]]. Realizing the plot that his enemies had moved against him, profoundly disillusioned, he voiced his bitterness: &quot;Grave must be my sins before the King, for I am in ill favor with the King for love of the men, and with the men for love of the King.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar Correia (1860) ''Lendas da Índia'', volume II, p 458&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling himself near death, he donned the surcoat of the [[Military Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]], of which he was a knight, and drew up his will, appointed the captain and senior officials of Ormuz, and organized a final council with his captains to decide the main matters affecting the Portuguese State of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early&quot;/&gt;

He wrote a brief letter to King Manuel, asking him to confer onto his [[natural son]] &quot;all of the high honors and rewards&quot; that were justly due to Afonso. He wrote in dignified and affectionate terms, assuring Manuel of his loyalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;intlhistory.blogspot.com.au&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Rinehart|title=Portugal: Chapter 2B. The Expansion of Portugal|work=Countries of the World|publisher=Bureau Development, Inc.|date=1 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1515, Afonso de Albuquerque died within sight of Goa. As his death was known, in the city &quot;grait wailing arose&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''na cidade se aleuantaram grandes prantos''... in Gaspar Correia,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aNU4AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:2-AWCaiAwF0C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAl5yUktDWAhUIlxoKHfYaB_sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lendas da Índia]'' 1860 edition, Typographia da Academia Real das Sciencias, pg. 459&lt;/ref&gt; and many took to the streets to witness his body carried on a chair by his main captains, in a procession lit by torches amidst the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;''Os capitães o leuaram assy assentado na cadeira, posto sobre hum palanquim, que era visto de todo o povo''... in Gaspar Correia,''[https://books.google.com/booksid=aNU4AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:2AWCaiAwF0C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAl5yUktDWAhUIlxoKHfYaB_sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lendas da Índia]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' 1860 edition, Typographia da Academia Real das Sciencias, pg. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

Afonso's body was buried in Goa, according to his will, in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Serra (Our Lady of the Hill), which he had been built in 1513 to thank the Madonna for his escape from [[Kamaran]] island.&lt;ref&gt;This Church was later demolished between 1811 and 1842; see Manoel José Gabriel Saldanha, &quot;História de Goa:(política e arqueológica)&quot;, p. 145, {{ISBN|81-206-0590-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night, even the Hindu natives of Goa gathered to mourn him alongside the Portuguese, &quot;for he was much loved by all&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''se ajuntou moltidão do povo com grandes prantos, christãos e gentios''... in Gaspar Correia, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aNU4AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:2-AWCaiAwF0C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAl5yUktDWAhUIlxoKHfYaB_sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lendas da Índia]'' 1860 edition, Typographia da Academia Real das Sciencias, pg. 459&lt;/ref&gt; and it was said that &quot;God had need of him for war, and for that he had taken him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...''que dizião que Deos o havia lá mister para guerras e por ysso o leuara ... in Gaspar Correia, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aNU4AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:2-AWCaiAwF0C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAl5yUktDWAhUIlxoKHfYaB_sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lendas da Índia]'' 1860 edition, Typographia da Academia Real das Sciencias, pg. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, King Manuel's zigzagging policies continued, still trapped by the constraints of real-time medieval communication between Lisbon and India and unaware that Afonso was dead. Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Albuquerque&quot;/&gt;

After 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Graça church in Lisbon,&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|upright|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902)]]
King Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, [[Brás de Albuquerque]] (1500–1580),&lt;ref&gt;Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift für Universalgeschichte''. [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], [[Stuttgart]]&lt;/ref&gt; whom he renamed &quot;Afonso&quot; in memory of the father.

Afonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship, covering topics from minor issues to major strategies. In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. (1993) ''Africans and Native Americans'' &quot;University of Illinois Press&quot;. 344 pages. {{ISBN|0-252-06321-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;- a clear reference to [[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Caesar's Commentaries]]- which he reviewed and re-published in 1576. There Afonso was described as &quot;a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Brás, ''Commentaries'', vol VI, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1572, Afonso's feats were described in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]] (Canto X, strophes 40–49). The poet praises his achievements, but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Camões was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called &quot;Brasão&quot; (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.

A [[Alphonso (mango)|variety of mango]] that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alphonso mangoes|work=Savani Farms|url=http://www.savanifarms.com/|accessdate=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the [[Padrão dos Descobrimentos]] monument; there is a [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square|square carrying his name]] in the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]], which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop [[Afonso de Albuquerque (1884)|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'' (1884)]] and the warship [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']], the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.

===Global legacy===
[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|upright=2|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue)]]
The fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times. In the 2nd century AD, the [[Malay Peninsula]] was known by the Greek philosopher [[Ptolemy]], who labeled it 'Aurea Chersonesus&quot;; and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance. Even Indian traders referred to the East Pacific region as &quot;Land of Gold&quot; and made regular visits to Malaya in search of the precious metal, tin and sweet scented jungle woods.&lt;ref&gt;''Lonely Planet Malaysia, Singapore &amp; Brunei'' by Simon Richmond, Lonely Planet (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But neither Ptolemy, nor Rome, nor Alexander was able to see the fabled regions of the East Pacific. Afonso de Albuquerque became the first European to reach the Spice Islands. Upon discovering the [[Malay Archipelago]], he proceeded in 1511 to conquer Malacca, then commissioned an expedition under the command of [[António de Abreu]] and Vice-Commander [[Francisco Serrão]] (the latter being a cousin of Magellan) to further explore the extremities of the region in east Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134844/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/12311/;jsessionid=1AEA90AE76CCD0D4E0F4A3BB3F7D1F3C?sequence=6 Cross-Cultural Alliance-Making and Local Resistance in Maluku during the Revolt of Prince Nuku, 1780–1810]'', by Proefschrift ter verkrijging van de graad van Doctor aan de Universiteit Leiden, op gezag van de Rector Magnificus, prof. mr. P. F. van der Heijden, volgens besluit van het College voor Promoties te verdedigen op woensdag 12 September 2007 klokke 15.00 uur. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these voyages of exploration, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to discover and to reach the fabled Spice Islands in the [[Indies]] in addition to discovering their sea routes. Afonso found what had evaded Columbus' grasp&amp;nbsp;– the wealth of the Orient. His discoveries did not go unnoticed, and it took little time for [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] to arrive in the same region a few years later and discover the [[Philippines]] for Spain, giving birth to the Papal [[Treaty of Zaragoza]].

Afonso's operations sent a voyage pushing further south which made the European discovery of Timor in the far south of Oceania, and the discovery of [[History of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] in 1512. This was followed up by another Portuguese, [[Jorge de Menezes]] in 1526, who named Papua New Guinea, the &quot;Island of the Papua&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sio.ucsd.edu/png/expedition/timeline.cfm|title=Papua New Guinea Expedition|publisher=Sio.ucsd.edu|accessdate=18 April 2013|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620023029/http://sio.ucsd.edu/png/expedition/timeline.cfm|archivedate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Through Afonso's diplomatic activities, Portugal opened the sea between Europe and China. As early as 1513, Jorge de Albuquerque, a Portuguese commanding officer in Malacca, sent his subordinate [[Jorge Álvares]] to sail to China on a ship loaded with pepper from Sumatra. After sailing across the sea, Jorge Álvares and his crew dropped anchor in Tamao, an island located at the mouth of the Pearl River. This was the first Portuguese to set foot in the territory known as China, the mythical &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; where they erected a stone [[Padrão]].&lt;ref&gt;NEWSLETTER JULY&amp;nbsp;– DECEMBER 2012.

==Son==
Afonso de Albuquerque had a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard son]] with an unrecorded woman. He legitimized the boy in February 1506. Before his death, he asked King Manuel I to leave to the son all his wealth and that the King oversee the son's education. When Afonso died, Manuel I renamed the child &quot;Afonso&quot; in his father's memory. Brás Afonso de Albuquerque, or Braz in the old spelling, was born in 1500 and died in 1580.
