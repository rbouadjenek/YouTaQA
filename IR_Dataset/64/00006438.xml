A '''chromosome''' is a [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]] molecule with part or all of the [[genome|genetic material (genome)]] of an organism. Most [[eukaryotic]] chromosomes include [[Histone|packaging proteins]] which, aided by [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone proteins]], bind to and [[DNA condensation|condense]] the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;HammondStrømme2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammond CM, Strømme CB, Huang H, Patel DJ, Groth A | title = Histone chaperone networks shaping chromatin function | journal = Nature Reviews.

Chromosomes are normally visible under a [[light microscope]] only when the cell is undergoing the [[metaphase]] of [[cell division]] (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Bray|first2=Dennis|last3=Hopkin|first3=Karen|last4=Johnson|first4=Alexander|last5=Lewis|first5=Julian|last6=Raff|first6=Martin|last7=Roberts|first7=Keith|last8=Walter|first8=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |title=Essential Cell Biology|date=2014|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York, NY, USA|isbn=978-0-8153-4454-4|pages=621–626|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once ([[S phase]]), and the copy is joined to the original by a [[centromere]], resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured here) if the [[centromere]] is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called [[sister chromatids]]. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study.&lt;ref name=&quot;vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit28715?|title=Microscopical researches into the accordance in the structure and growth of animals and plants|last=Schleyden|first=M.

Chromosomal [[genetic recombination|recombination]] during [[meiosis]] and subsequent [[sexual reproduction]] play a significant role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo [[mitotic catastrophe]]. Usually, this will make the cell initiate [[apoptosis]] leading to its own death, but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of [[cancer]].

Some use the term chromosome in a wider sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin in cells, either visible or not under light microscopy. Others use the concept in a narrower sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin during cell division, visible under light microscopy due to high condensation.

== Etymology ==

The word ''chromosome'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|m|ə|ˌ|s|oʊ|m|,_|-|ˌ|z|oʊ|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-12-539683-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Chromosome}}&lt;/ref&gt;) comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χρῶμα}} (''chroma'', &quot;colour&quot;) and {{lang|grc|σῶμα}} (''soma'', &quot;body&quot;), describing their strong staining by particular [[dye]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biological Stains – A Handbook on the Nature and Uses of the Dyes Employed in the Biological Laboratory|last = Coxx|first = H. J.|publisher = Commission on Standardization of Biological Stains|date = 1925|url = https://archive.org/stream/biologicalstains00conn/biologicalstains00conn_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by the German scientist [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|von Waldeyer-Hartz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waldeyer-Hartz  | year = 1888 | title = Über Karyokinese und ihre Beziehungen zu den Befruchtungsvorgängen | url = | journal = Archiv für Mikroskopische Anatomie und Entwicklungsmechanik | volume = 32 | issue = | page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the term [[chromatin]], which was itself introduced by [[Walther Flemming]], who discovered cell division.

Some of the early karyological terms have become outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garbari | first = Fabio | last2 = Bedini | first2 = Gianni | last3 = Peruzzi | first3 = Lorenzo | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2012 | title = Chromosome numbers of the Italian flora.

The German scientists [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de&quot;/&gt; [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchow]] and [[Butschli, O.|Bütschli]] were among the first scientists who first recognized the structures now familiar as chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fokin SI | year = 2013 | title = Otto Bütschli (1848–1920) Where we will genuflect? | url = http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num8_1/fokin_protistology_8-1.pdf | journal = Protistology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 22–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of experiments beginning in the mid-1880s, [[Theodor Boveri]] gave the definitive demonstration that chromosomes are the [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] of heredity; his two principles or postulates were the ''continuity'' of chromosomes and the ''individuality'' of chromosomes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}{{explain|date=October 2015}} It is the second of these principles that was so original.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[Wilhelm Roux]] suggested that each chromosome carries a different [[genetic load|genetic configuration]] , and Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery at the start of the 1900s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s earlier work, Boveri was able to point out the connection between the rules of inheritance and the behaviour of the chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American cytologists: [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]], [[Nettie Stevens]], [[Walter Sutton]] and [[Theophilus Painter]] were all influenced by Boveri (Wilson, Stevens, and Painter actually worked with him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Elof A. | title = Mendel's Legacy: The Origin of Classical Genetics | location = Cold Spring Harbor, NY | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | pages = 88 | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-087969675-7 | url = http://www.cshlpress.com/pdf/sample/mendel7.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his famous textbook ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', Wilson linked together the independent work of Boveri and Sutton (both around 1902) by naming the chromosome theory of inheritance the [[Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory]] (the names are sometimes reversed).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.B. (1925). ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', Ed. 3. Macmillan, New York. p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] remarks that the theory was hotly contested by some famous geneticists: [[William Bateson]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen]], [[Richard Goldschmidt]] and [[T.H. Morgan]], all of a rather dogmatic turn of mind. Eventually, complete proof came from chromosome maps in Morgan's own lab.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, E. (1982). ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of human chromosomes was published in 1923 by [[Theophilus Painter]]. By inspection through the microscope, he counted 24 pairs, which would mean 48 chromosomes. His error was copied by others and it was not until 1956 that the true number, 46, was determined by Indonesia-born cytogeneticist [[Joe Hin Tjio]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Prokaryotes==
The [[prokaryote]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]&amp;nbsp;– typically have a single [[Circular bacterial chromosome|circular chromosome]], but many variations exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Shapiro L | title = Chromosome organization and segregation in bacteria | journal = Journal of Structural Biology | volume = 156 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–303 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 16860572 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsb.2006.05.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chromosomes of most bacteria, which some authors prefer to call [[genophore]]s, can range in size from only 130,000 [[base pair]]s in the [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] bacteria ''[[Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;mccutcheon2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Leuven JT, Meister RC, Simon C, McCutcheon JP | title = Sympatric speciation in a bacterial endosymbiont results in two genomes with the functionality of one | journal = Cell | volume = 158 | issue = 6 | pages = 1270–1280 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25175626 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.07.047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Candidatus Tremblaya princeps]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCutcheon JP, von Dohlen CD | title = An interdependent metabolic patchwork in the nested symbiosis of mealybugs | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 16 | pages = 1366–72 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21835622 | pmc = 3169327 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2011.06.051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to more than 14,000,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacterium ''[[Sorangium cellulosum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Han K, Li ZF, Peng R, Zhu LP, Zhou T, Wang LG, Li SG, Zhang XB, Hu W, Wu ZH, Qin N, Li YZ | title = Extraordinary expansion of a Sorangium cellulosum genome from an alkaline milieu | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | pages = 2101 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23812535 | pmc = 3696898 | doi = 10.1038/srep02101 | bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E2101H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirochaete]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Borrelia]]'' are a notable exception to this arrangement, with bacteria such as ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', the cause of [[Lyme disease]], containing a single ''linear'' chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hinnebusch J, Tilly K | title = Linear plasmids and chromosomes in bacteria | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 917–22 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934868 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00963.x  | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure in sequences ===
Prokaryotic chromosomes have less sequence-based structure than eukaryotes. Bacteria typically have a one-point (the [[origin of replication]]) from which replication starts, whereas some archaea contain multiple replication origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelman LM, Kelman Z | title = Multiple origins of replication in archaea | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 399–401 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15337158 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2004.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes in prokaryotes are often organized in [[operons]], and do not usually contain [[intron]]s, unlike eukaryotes.

=== DNA packaging ===
[[Prokaryote]]s do not possess nuclei. Instead, their DNA is organized into a structure called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24158908&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le TB, Imakaev MV, Mirny LA, Laub MT | title = High-resolution mapping of the spatial organization of a bacterial chromosome | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6159 | pages = 731–4 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24158908 | pmc = 3927313 | doi = 10.1126/science.1242059 | bibcode = 2013Sci...342..731L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nucleoid is a distinct structure and occupies a defined region of the bacterial cell. This structure is, however, dynamic and is maintained and remodeled by the actions of a range of histone-like proteins, which associate with the bacterial chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN | title = Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350–64 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9893710 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[archaea]], the DNA in chromosomes is even more organized, with the DNA packaged within structures similar to eukaryotic nucleosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandman K, Reeve JN | title = Structure and functional relationships of archaeal and eukaryal histones and nucleosomes | journal = Archives of Microbiology | volume = 173 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10763747 | doi = 10.1007/s002039900122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pereira SL, Grayling RA, Lurz R, Reeve JN | title = Archaeal nucleosomes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 23 | pages = 12633–7 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9356501 | pmc = 25063 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.23.12633 | bibcode = 1997PNAS...9412633P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain bacteria also contain [[plasmid]]s or other [[extrachromosomal DNA]]. These are circular structures in the [[cytoplasm]] that contain cellular DNA and play a role in [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de&quot; /&gt; In prokaryotes (see [[nucleoids]]) and [[virus]]es,&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedirect.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson JE, Chiu W | title = Structures of virus and virus-like particles | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–35 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10753814 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-440X(00)00073-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the DNA is often densely packed and organized; in the case of [[archaea]], by homology to eukaryotic histones, and in the case of bacteria, by [[Histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein|histone-like]] proteins.

Bacterial chromosomes tend to be tethered to the [[plasma membrane]] of the bacteria. In molecular biology application, this allows for its isolation from plasmid DNA by centrifugation of lysed bacteria and pelleting of the membranes (and the attached DNA).

Prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids are, like eukaryotic DNA, generally [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled]]. The DNA must first be released into its relaxed state for access for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], regulation, and [[DNA replication|replication]].

== Eukaryotes ==
[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|280px|Organization of DNA in a eukaryotic cell]]
{{See also|Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure}}

Chromosomes in eukaryotes are composed of [[chromatin]] fiber. Chromatin fiber is made of [[nucleosome]]s ([[histone octamer]]s with part of a DNA strand attached to and wrapped around it). Chromatin fibers are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called [[chromatin]]. Chromatin contains the vast majority of DNA, but a [[Mitochondrial DNA|small amount]] inherited maternally, can be found in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Chromatin is present in most [[Cell (biology)|cells]], with a few exceptions, for example, [[red blood cell]]s.

Chromatin allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the [[cell nucleus]]. During cell division chromatin condenses further to form microscopically visible chromosomes. The structure of chromosomes varies through the [[cell cycle]]. During cellular division chromosomes are replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their [[offspring|progeny]]. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single double helixes, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called [[chromatids]] or [[sister chromatids]]) joined by a [[centromere]].

[[File:Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|center|850px|The major structures in DNA compaction: [[DNA]], the [[nucleosome]], the 10&amp;nbsp;nm &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; fibre, the 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre and the [[metaphase]] chromosome.]]
[[Eukaryotes]] ([[cell (biology)|cells]] with nuclei such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one [[centromere]], with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[Mitochondrial DNA|genome]], and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear [[cytoplasm]]ic chromosomes.

In the nuclear chromosomes of [[eukaryote]]s, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around [[histone]]s (structural [[protein]]s), forming a composite material called [[chromatin]].

=== Interphase chromatin ===
During [[interphase]] (the period of the [[cell cycle]] where the cell is not dividing), two types of [[chromatin]] can be distinguished:
* [[Euchromatin]], which consists of DNA that is active, e.g., being expressed as protein.
* [[Heterochromatin]], which consists of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types:
** ''Constitutive heterochromatin'', which is never expressed. It is located around the centromere and usually contains [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].
** ''Facultative heterochromatin'', which is sometimes expressed.

=== Metaphase chromatin and division ===
{{see also|mitosis|meiosis}}
&lt;!-- too many pictures! [[File:ChickenChromosomesBMC Genomics5-56Fig4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chicken chromosomes during [[metaphase]], with highlighted [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]]] --&gt;
[[File:HumanChromosomesChromomycinA3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Human chromosomes during [[metaphase]]]]
In the early stages of [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]] (cell division), the chromatin double helix become more and more condensed. They cease to function as accessible genetic material ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister [[chromatids]] attached to each other at the [[centromere]]. The shorter arms are called ''p arms'' (from the [[French language|French]] ''petit'', small) and the longer arms are called ''q arms'' (''q'' follows ''p'' in the Latin alphabet; q-g &quot;grande&quot;; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for ''queue'' meaning tail in French&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/chromosome-mapping-idiograms-302 Chromosome Mapping: Idiograms]&quot; ''Nature Education'' – August 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical [[microscope]].

Mitotic metaphase chromosomes are best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24200812&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naumova N, Imakaev M, Fudenberg G, Zhan Y, Lajoie BR, Mirny LA, Dekker J | title = Organization of the mitotic chromosome | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6161 | pages = 948–53 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24200812 | pmc = 4040465 | doi = 10.1126/science.1236083 | bibcode = 2013Sci...342..948N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During mitosis, [[microtubule]]s grow from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called [[kinetochores]], one of which is present on each sister [[chromatid]]. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.

=== Human chromosomes ===
Chromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: [[autosome]]s (body chromosome(s)) and allosome ([[sex chromosome]](s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the [[mitochondrial genome]]. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the [[Sanger Institute]]'s human genome information in the [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/index.html Vega.sanger.ad.uk], all data in this table was derived from this database, November 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on [[gene prediction]]s. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced [[heterochromatin]] regions.

{{main|List of organisms by chromosome count}}

=== In eukaryotes ===
These tables give the total number of chromosomes (including sex chromosomes) in a cell nucleus. For example, most [[eukaryotes]] are [[Ploidy|diploid]], like [[Human#Genetics|humans]] who have 22 different types of [[autosome]]s, each present as two homologous pairs, and two [[sex chromosomes]]. This gives 46 chromosomes in total. Other organisms have more than two copies of their chromosome types, such as [[Common wheat|bread wheat]], which is ''hexaploid'' and has six copies of seven different chromosome types&amp;nbsp;– 42 chromosomes in total.

Normal members of a particular eukaryotic [[species]] all have the same number of nuclear chromosomes (see the table). Other eukaryotic chromosomes, i.e., mitochondrial and plasmid-like small chromosomes, are much more variable in number, and there may be thousands of copies per cell.

[[File:PLoSBiol3.5.Fig1bNucleus46Chromosomes.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The 23 human [[chromosome territories]] during [[prometaphase]] in [[fibroblast]] cells]]

[[Asexual reproduction|Asexually reproducing]] species have one set of chromosomes that are the same in all body cells. However, asexual species can be either haploid or diploid.

[[sexual reproduction|Sexually reproducing]] species have [[somatic cell]]s (body cells), which are [[diploid]] [2n] having two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs in humans with one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent), one set from the mother and one from the father. [[Gamete]]s, reproductive cells, are [[haploid]] [n]: They have one set of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by [[meiosis]] of a diploid [[germ line]] cell. During meiosis, the matching chromosomes of father and mother can exchange small parts of themselves ([[Chromosomal crossover|crossover]]), and thus create new chromosomes that are not inherited solely from either parent. When a male and a female gamete merge ([[fertilization]]), a new diploid organism is formed.

Some animal and plant species are [[polyploid]] [Xn]: They have more than two sets of [[homologous chromosome]]s. Plants important in agriculture such as [[tobacco]] or [[wheat]] are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some [[cultivar]]s as well as the wild progenitors. The more-common [[pasta]] and [[bread]] wheat types are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sakamura |first1=Tetsu |date=1918 |title= Kurze Mitteilung über die Chromosomenzahlen und die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der Triticum-Arten |journal= Shokubutsugaku Zasshi |volume=32 |issue=379 |pages=150–3 |doi=10.15281/jplantres1887.32.379_150|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jplantres1887/32/379/32_379_150/_pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In prokaryotes ===
[[Prokaryote]] [[species]] generally have one copy of each major chromosome, but most cells can easily survive with multiple copies.&lt;ref&gt;Charlebois R.L. (ed) 1999. ''Organization of the prokaryote genome''. ASM Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria)|Buchnera]]'', a [[symbiosis|symbiont]] of [[aphid]]s has multiple copies of its chromosome, ranging from 10–400 copies per cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Komaki K, Ishikawa H | title = Genomic copy number of intracellular bacterial symbionts of aphids varies in response to developmental stage and morph of their host | journal = Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–8 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10732993 | doi = 10.1016/S0965-1748(99)00125-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some large bacteria, such as ''[[Epulopiscium fishelsoni]]'' up to 100,000 copies of the chromosome can be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendell JE, Clements KD, Choat JH, Angert ER | title = Extreme polyploidy in a large bacterium | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 18 | pages = 6730–4 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18445653 | pmc = 2373351 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0707522105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.6730M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmids and plasmid-like small chromosomes are, as in eukaryotes, highly variable in copy number. The number of plasmids in the cell is almost entirely determined by the rate of division of the plasmid&amp;nbsp;– fast division causes high copy number.

D. |title=The chromosomes |url=https://archive.org/details/chromosomes01whit |url-access=registration |publisher=Chapman and Hall, distributed by Halsted Press, New York |location=London |date=1973 |page=28 |isbn=978-0-412-11930-9 |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of [[cytogenetics]].

Although the [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[DNA]] is highly standardized in [[eukaryotes]], ''the same cannot be said for their karyotypes'', which are often highly variable. There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.
In some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:
:1. variation between the two sexes
:2. variation between the [[germ-line]] and [[soma (biology)|soma]] (between [[gamete]]s and the rest of the body)
:3. variation between members of a population, due to [[polymorphism (biology)|balanced genetic polymorphism]]
:4. [[allopatric speciation|geographical variation]] between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]
:5. [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.
Also, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilized egg.

The technique of determining the karyotype is usually called ''karyotyping''. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) [[in vitro]] (in a reaction vial) with [[colchicine]]. These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a ''karyogram'', with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end.

Like many sexually reproducing species, humans have special [[XY sex-determination system|gonosomes]] (sex chromosomes, in contrast to [[autosome]]s). These are XX in females and XY in males. &lt;!--- Irrelevant in this section:&quot;In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactive and can be seen under a microscope as [[Barr body|Barr bodies]].&quot;---&gt;

=== History and analysis techniques ===
{{see also|Argument from authority#Use in science}}
Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: ''How many chromosomes does a normal [[diploid]] human cell contain?'' In 1912, [[Hans von Winiwarter]] reported 47 chromosomes in [[spermatogonia]] and 48 in [[oogonia]], concluding an [[XO sex-determination system|XX/XO]] [[Sex-determination system|sex determination mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=von Winiwarter H |title=Études sur la spermatogenèse humaine |journal=Archives de Biologie |volume=27 |issue=93 |pages=147–9 |date=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theophilus Painter|Painter]] in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man is 46 or 48, at first favouring 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Painter TS |title=The spermatogenesis of man |journal=Anat. Res.|volume=23 |page=129 |date=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an [[XY sex-determination system|XX/XY]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Painter|first1=Theophilus S.|title=Studies in mammalian spermatogenesis. II. The spermatogenesis of man|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|date=April 1923|volume=37|issue=3|pages=291–336|doi=10.1002/jez.1400370303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New techniques were needed to definitively solve the problem:
# Using cells in culture
# Arresting [[mitosis]] in [[metaphase]] by a solution of [[colchicine]]
# Pretreating cells in a [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic solution]] 0.075 M KCl, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
# Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
# Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

It took until 1954 before the human diploid number was confirmed as 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1956.tb03010.x | vauthors = Tjio JH, Levan A | title=The chromosome number of man |journal=Hereditas |volume=42 |pages=1–6 |date=1956 |issue=1–2|hdl=10261/15776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford CE, Hamerton JL | title = The chromosomes of man | journal = Nature | volume = 178 | issue = 4541 | pages = 1020–3 | date = November 1956 | pmid = 13378517 | doi = 10.1038/1781020a0 | bibcode = 1956Natur.178.1020F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the techniques of Winiwarter and Painter, their results were quite remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu T.C. ''Human and mammalian cytogenetics: a historical perspective''. Springer-Verlag, N.Y. p10: &quot;It's amazing that he [Painter] even came close!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pan (genus)|Chimpanzee]]s, the closest living relatives to modern humans, have 48 chromosomes as do the other [[great apes]]: in humans two chromosomes fused to form [[Chromosome 2 (human)|chromosome 2]].

== Aberrations ==
[[File:Chromosome 21.png|thumb|In Down syndrome, there are three copies of chromosome 21.]]

Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell and are a major cause of genetic conditions in humans, such as [[Down syndrome]], although most aberrations have little to no effect. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as [[translocations]], or [[chromosomal inversions]], although they may lead to a higher chance of bearing a child with a chromosome disorder. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, called [[aneuploidy]], may be lethal or may give rise to genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santaguida S, Amon A | title = Short- and long-term effects of chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 473–85 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26204159 | doi = 10.1038/nrm4025 | hdl = 1721.1/117201 | url = http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/117201/1/Amon1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic counseling]] is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.

The gain or loss of DNA from chromosomes can lead to a variety of [[genetic disorders]]. Human examples include:
* [[Cri du chat]], which is caused by the [[Genetic deletion|deletion]] of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. &quot;Cri du chat&quot; means &quot;cry of the cat&quot; in French; the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries that sound like those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health problems, and are very short.
* [[Down syndrome]], the most common trisomy, usually caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 ([[trisomy 21]]). Characteristics include decreased muscle tone, stockier build, asymmetrical skull, slanting eyes and mild to moderate developmental disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Kenneth R. | name-list-format = vanc | title=Biology|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|date=2000|edition=5th |pages=194–5|chapter=Chapter 9-3|isbn=978-0-13-436265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edwards syndrome]], or trisomy-18, the second most common trisomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Trisomy 18?|url=http://www.trisomy18.org/what-is-trisomy-18/|website=Trisomy 18 Foundation|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include motor retardation, developmental disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems. Ninety percent of those affected die in infancy. They have characteristic clenched hands and overlapping fingers.
* [[Isodicentric 15]], also called idic(15), partial tetrasomy 15q, or inverted duplication 15 (inv dup 15).
* [[Jacobsen syndrome]], which is very rare. It is also called the terminal 11q deletion disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://11q.chromosome11.eu/ European Chromosome 11 Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{failed verification|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected have normal intelligence or mild developmental disability, with poor expressive language skills. Most have a bleeding disorder called [[Paris-Trousseau syndrome]].
* [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome are usually sterile and tend to be taller and have longer arms and legs than their peers. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet and have a higher incidence of [[speech delay]] and [[dyslexia]]. Without testosterone treatment, some may develop [[gynecomastia]] during puberty.
* [[Patau Syndrome]], also called D-Syndrome or trisomy-13. Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, without the characteristic folded hand.
* [[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]. This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [[Cat-eye syndrome]] and [[Isodicentric 15|isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome]] (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [[Pallister–Killian syndrome]].
* [[Triple-X syndrome]] (XXX). XXX girls tend to be tall and thin and have a higher incidence of dyslexia.
* [[Turner syndrome]] (X instead of XX or XY). In Turner syndrome, female sexual characteristics are present but underdeveloped. Females with Turner syndrome often have a short stature, low hairline, abnormal eye features and bone development and a &quot;caved-in&quot; appearance to the chest.
* [[Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome]], which is caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. It is characterized by growth retardation, delayed motor skills development, &quot;Greek Helmet&quot; facial features, and mild to profound mental health problems.
* [[XYY syndrome]]. XYY boys are usually taller than their siblings. Like XXY boys and XXX girls, they are more likely to have learning difficulties.

===Sperm aneuploidy===
