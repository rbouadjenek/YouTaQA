The '''dot-com bubble''' (also known as the '''dot-com boom''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-the-kings-of-the-1990s-dot-com-bubble-bust-2016-12 | title=One of the kings of the '90s dot-com bubble now faces 20 years in prison | first=Jim | last=Edwards | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''tech bubble''',&lt;ref name=techbubble&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/whatever-happened-tech-bubble/594856/ | title=More Money Than Anyone Imagined | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=July 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Internet bubble''') was a [[stock market bubble]] caused by excessive [[speculation]] in Internet-related companies in the late 1990s, a period of massive growth in the use and adoption of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=techbubble/&gt; Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, the [[Nasdaq Composite]] [[stock market index]] rose 400% only to fall 78% from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble.

==Prelude to the bubble==
In 1993, the release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic web browser]] made access to the [[World Wide Web]] possible (prior Internet services like [[Usenet]], [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; existed, but [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] was the new invention which triggered this growth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news-gazette.com/news/mosaic-started-web-rush-internet-boom/article_a459cd7f-dafe-5de4-a5fe-c3723a009af2.html |title=Mosaic started Web rush, Internet boom |first=Greg |last=Kline |work=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]] |date=April 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet use increased as a result of the reduction of the &quot;[[digital divide]]&quot; and advances in connectivity, uses of the Internet, and computer education. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35% as computer ownership progressed from a luxury to a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/computer-ownership-up-sharply-in-the-1990s.pdf |title=Issues in labor Statistics |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]] |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the shift to the [[Information Age]], an economy based on [[information technology]], and many new companies were founded.

At the same time, a decline in interest rates increased the availability of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-dot-com-bubble-in-photos-2016-2/ |title=If you're too young to remember the insanity of the dot-com bubble, check out these pictures |first=Matt |last=Weinberger |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which lowered the top marginal [[capital gains tax in the United States]], also made people more willing to make more speculative investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-the-dot-com-bubble-began-and-why-it-popped-2010-12 |title=Here's Why The Dot Com Bubble Began And Why It Popped |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Greenspan]], then-[[Chair of the Federal Reserve]], allegedly fueled investments in the stock market by putting a positive spin on stock valuations.&lt;ref name=enigma/&gt; The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] was expected to result in many new technologies from which many people wanted to profit.&lt;ref name=now /&gt;

==The bubble==
As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any [[dot-com company]], especially if it had one of the [[Internet-related prefixes]] or a &quot;[[.com]]&quot; [[suffix]] in its name. [[Venture capital]] was easy to raise. [[Investment bank]]s, which profited significantly from [[initial public offering]]s (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.&lt;ref name=swindle /&gt; A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the [[quaternary sector of the economy]] and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the [[price–earnings ratio]], and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a [[stock market bubble]].&lt;ref name=enigma&gt;{{cite journal |last=Teeter |first=Preston |last2=Sandberg |first2=Jorgen |year=2017 |title=Cracking the enigma of asset bubbles with narratives |journal=Strategic Organization |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=91–99 |doi=10.1177/1476127016629880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%. It reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese [[Nikkei 225]] during the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] of 1991.&lt;ref name=enigma/&gt; In 1999, shares of [[Qualcomm]] rose in value by 2,619%, 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000%  value, and seven additional large-cap stocks each rose over 900% in value. Even though the Nasdaq Composite rose 85.6% and the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/03/business/the-year-in-the-markets-1999-extraordinary-winners-and-more-losers.html |title=THE YEAR IN THE MARKETS; 1999: Extraordinary Winners and More Losers |first=Floyd |last=Norris |authorlink=Floyd Norris |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to engage in full-time [[day trading]] were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991726,00.html |title=Day Trading: It's a Brutal World |first=Daniel |last=Kadlec |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 9, 1999 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[news media]] took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market; an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' suggested that investors &quot;re-think&quot; the &quot;quaint idea&quot; of profits, and [[CNBC]] reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the [[broadcasting of sports events]].&lt;ref name=enigma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofcrashgr00roge |url-access=registration |title=Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing |first=Roger |last=Lowenstein |authorlink=Roger Lowenstein |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59420-003-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofcrashgr00roge/page/115 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a [[public company]] via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue. People who received [[employee stock option]]s became instant paper millionaires when their companies executed IPOs; however, most employees were barred from selling shares immediately due to [[lock-up period]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;swindle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Totally_Wired.html?id=GoDuPQAACAAJ |title=Totally Wired: On the Trail of the Great Dotcom Swindle |authorlink=Andrew Smith (author) |first=Andrew |last=Smith |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Books]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84737-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2019}} The most successful entrepreneurs, such as [[Mark Cuban]], sold their shares or entered into [[Hedge (finance)|hedges]] to protect their gains.

===Spending tendencies of dot-com companies===
Most dot-com companies incurred [[net operating loss]]es as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness [[network effect]]s to build [[market share]] or [[mind share]] as fast as possible, using the mottos &quot;get big fast&quot; and &quot;get large or get lost&quot;. These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough [[brand awareness]] to charge profitable rates for their services in the future.&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/business/23proto.html |title=Lessons of Survival, From the Dot-Com Attic |first=LESLIE |last=BERLIN |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB958412442522904320 |title=MotherNature.com's CEO Defends Dot-Coms' Get-Big-Fast Strategy |first=John |last=Dodge |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=May 16, 2000 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2000, there were 16 [[dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV]], each costing $2 million for a 30-second spot.

The &quot;growth over profits&quot; mentality and the aura of &quot;[[new economy]]&quot; invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a [[dot com party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2000/04/25/party_5/ |title=Dot-com party madness |first=Damien |last=Cave |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=April 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-dec-25-mn-4559-story.html |title=Dot-Com Parties Dry Up |first=P.J. |last=HuffStutter |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubble in telecom===
[[Telecommunications equipment]] providers, convinced that the future economy would require ubiquitous [[broadband access]], went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high-speed equipment and [[fiber optic]] cables. In many areas, such as the [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] in Virginia, governments funded technology infrastructure and created favorable business and tax law to encourage companies to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Sally B. |last2=Zagorin |first2=Adam |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,52073-2,00.html |title=D.C. Dotcom |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 14, 2000 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, [[mobile phone]] companies overspent on [[3G]] licences, which led them deep into debt. The investments in infrastructure were far out of proportion to [[cash flow]]. The high levels of investment led to a heightened competition for customers, leading many telecoms providers to slash prices for services, especially in the hyper-competitive European marketplace. These were major factors that led to the [[telecoms crash]].&lt;ref name=now&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-telecommunications-crash-what-to-do-now/ |title=The Telecommunications Crash: What To Do Now? | first=Robert E. | last=Litan |work=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=December 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bursting of the bubble==
{{see also|Early 2000s recession}}
[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|400px|right|Historical government interest rates in the United States]]

Around the turn of the millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the [[Year 2000 problem]]. There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider social or economic problems, but in reality there was virtually no impact or disruption.

On January 10, 2000, [[America Online]], led by [[Steve Case]] and [[Ted Leonsis]], announced a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] with [[Time Warner]], led by [[Gerald M. Levin]]. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/01/10/deals/aol_warner/ |title=Thats AOL folks |first=Tom |last=Johnson | work=[[CNN]] |date=January 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, [[Alan Greenspan]] announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

On March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5,048.62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0310nasdaq-bust/ |title=March 10, 2000: Pop Goes the Nasdaq! |first=Tony |last=Long |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2000, news that [[Japan]] had once again entered a [[recession]] triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/13/markets/markets_newyork/ |title=Nasdaq tumbles on Japan | work=[[CNN]] |date=March 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2000, [[Yahoo!]] and [[eBay]] ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6% but the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/15/markets/markets_newyork/ |title=Dow wows Wall Street | work=[[CNN]] |date=March 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2000, ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' featured a cover article titled &quot;Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast&quot;, which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many Internet companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB953335580704470544 |title=Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast |first=Jack |last=Willoughby |work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date=March 10, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led many people to rethink their investments. That same day, [[MicroStrategy]] announced a revenue restatement due to aggressive accounting practices. Its stock price, which had risen from $7 per share to as high as $333 per share in a year, fell $140 per share, or 62%, in a day.&lt;ref name=micro&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/20/companies/microstrategy/ |title=MicroStrategy plummets |work=[[CNN]] |date=March 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, leading to an [[inverted yield curve]], although stocks rallied temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/21/markets/markets_newyork/ |title=Wall St.: What rate hike? | work=[[CNN]] |date=March 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2000, judge [[Thomas Penfield Jackson]] issued his ''conclusions of law'' in the case of [[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)]] and ruled that Microsoft was guilty of [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]] in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. This led to a one-day 15% decline in the value of shares in Microsoft and a 350-point, or 8%, drop in the value of the Nasdaq. Many people saw the legal actions as bad for technology in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/04/03/markets/markets_newyork/ |title=Nasdaq sinks 350 points | work=[[CNN]] |date=April 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, [[Bloomberg News]] published a widely read article that stated: &quot;It's time, at last, to pay attention to the numbers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-04-02/commentary-earth-to-dot-com-accountants |title=Commentary: Earth To Dot Com Accountants |first=Catherine |last=Yang | work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=April 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, April 14, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index fell 9%, ending a week in which it fell 25%. Investors were forced to sell stocks ahead of [[Tax Day (United States)|Tax Day]], the due date to pay taxes on gains realized in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/04/14/markets/markets_newyork/ |title=Bleak Friday on Wall Street |work=[[CNN]] |date=April 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2000, dot-com companies were forced to rethink their advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/iq-news-dot-coms-re-evaluate-ad-spending-habits-38208/ |title=IQ News: Dot-Coms Re-Evaluate Ad Spending Habits |first=Jennifer |last=Owens |work=[[AdWeek]] |date=June 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2000, [[Pets.com]], a much-hyped company that had backing from Amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing its IPO.&lt;ref name=pets&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/07/technology/pets/ |title=Pets.com at its tail end | work=[[CNN]] |date=November 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-originals/watch/the-pets-com-phenomenon-789155395746 |title=The Pets.com Phenomenon | work=[[MSNBC]] |date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, most Internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs, wiping out $1.755 trillion in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/ |title=The $1.7 trillion dot.com lesson |first=David |last=Kleinbard | work=[[CNN]] |date=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, just three dot-com companies bought advertising spots during [[Super Bowl XXXV]]: [[E-Trade]], operator of an [[electronic trading platform]], and two employment websites: [[Monster.com]] and [[Yahoo! HotJobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/08/business/media-business-advertising-super-commercial-bowl-xxxv-not-coms-are-beating-dot.html |title=In Super Commercial Bowl XXXV, the not-coms are beating the dot-coms |first=Stuart |last=Elliott | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 8, 2001 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[September 11 attacks]] accelerated the stock-market drop later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/09/11/europe/markets_europe/ |title=World markets shatter |work=[[CNN]] |date=September 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investor confidence was further eroded by several [[accounting scandal]]s and the resulting bankruptcies, including the [[Enron scandal]] in October 2001, the [[WorldCom]] scandal in June 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2002/07/19/news/worldcom_bankruptcy/ |title=WorldCom files largest bankruptcy ever |first=Luisa |last=Beltran | work=[[CNN]] |date=July 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] scandal in July 2002.

By the end of the [[stock market downturn of 2002]], stocks had lost $5 trillion in [[market capitalization]] since the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jul-16-fi-overheat16-story.html |title=Fears of Dot-Com Crash, Version 2.0 |first1=Chris |last1=Gaither |first2=Dawn C. |last2=Chmielewski |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its trough on October 9, 2002, the NASDAQ-100 had dropped to 1,114, down 78% from its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-lessons-investors-tech-bubble-2015-02-11 |title=3 Lessons for Investors From the Tech Bubble |first=James K. |last=Glassman |work=[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] |date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/mar/10/newmedia.media |title=Looking back on the crash |first=Chris |last=Alden |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[online shopping]] companies, such as [[Pets.com]], [[Webvan]], and [[Boo.com]], as well as communication companies, such as [[Worldcom]], [[NorthPoint Communications]] and [[Global Crossing]], failed and shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-greatest-defunct-web-sites-and-dotcom-disasters/ |title=The greatest defunct Web sites and dotcom disasters |work=[[CNET]] |date=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=valuation&gt;{{cite book |title=Valuation: Theories and Concepts|last=Kumar |first=Rajesh |date=December 5, 2015|publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Cisco]], whose stock declined by 86%,&lt;ref name=valuation/&gt; and [[Qualcomm]], lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived, and some companies, such as [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com]], lost value but recovered quickly.

==Aftermath==
After venture capital was no longer available, the operational mentality of executives and investors completely changed. A dot-com company's lifespan was measured by its [[burn rate]], the rate at which it spent its existing capital. Many dot-com companies ran out of capital and went through [[liquidation]]. Supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for services fell. However, many companies were able to endure the crash; 48% of dot-com companies survived through 2004, albeit at lower valuations.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

Several companies and their executives, including [[Bernard Ebbers]], [[Jeffrey Skilling]], and [[Kenneth Lay]], were accused or convicted of [[fraud]] for misusing shareholders' money, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] levied large fines against investment firms including [[Citigroup]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] for misleading investors.

After suffering losses, retail investors transitioned their investment portfolios to more cautious positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hard Times Investing: For Some, Cash Is Everything And Only Thing |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/38308960 |first=Rob |last=Reuteman | work=[[CNBC]] |date=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular [[Internet forum]]s that focused on [[high tech]] stocks, such as [[Silicon Investor]], [[RagingBull.com]], [[Yahoo! Finance]], and [[The Motley Fool]] declined in use significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB980897351252699393 |title=Raging Bull Goes for a Bargain As Interest in Stock Chat Wanes |first=Stacy |last=Forster |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job market and office equipment glut===
Layoffs of [[programmer]]s resulted in a [[general glut]] in the job market. University enrollment for computer-related degrees dropped noticeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=desJardins |first=Marie |title=The real reason U.S. students lag behind in computer science |url=https://fortune.com/2015/10/22/u-s-students-computer-science/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After the Dot-Com Bubble: Silicon Valley High-Tech Employment And Wages in 2001 and 2008 |url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/regional_reports/200908_silicon_valley_high_tech.htm |first1=Amar |last1=Mann |first2=Tony |last2=Nunes | work=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotes of unemployed programmers going back to school to become accountants or lawyers were common.

[[Aeron chair]]s, which retailed for $1,100 each and were the symbol of the opulent office furniture of dot-com companies, were liquidated en masse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/21364/ | title=Remembering the Dot-Com Throne | first=Brian | last=Kennedy | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
As growth in the technology sector stabilized, companies consolidated; some, such as [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and [[Google]] gained market share and came to dominate their respective fields. The most valuable companies are now in the technology sector.

In a 2015 book, venture capitalist [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]], who funded many dot-com companies and lost 90% of his net worth when the bubble burst, said about the dot-com bubble:

{{quote|A friend of mine has a great line. He says &quot;Nothing important has ever been built without [[irrational exuberance]]&quot;. Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high [[throughput]] backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Here's what the future of bitcoin looks like—and it's bright |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/14/heres-what-the-future-of-bitcoin-looks-like-and-its-bright/ |first=Jacob |last=Donnelly |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
