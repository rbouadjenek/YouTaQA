== Circumstances ==
Ibn Sina created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], in which the translations of [[Greco-Roman]], [[Persia]]n, and [[India]]n texts were studied extensively. Greco-Roman ([[Middle Platonism|Mid-]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]) texts translated by the [[Al-Kindi|Kindi]] school were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic intellectuals, who also built upon Persian and [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematical]] systems, [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]] and [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Major periods of Muslim education and learning |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education |accessdate=2007-12-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212112030/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education |archivedate=12 December 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samanid dynasty]] in the eastern part of [[Persia]], [[Greater Khorasan]] and Central Asia as well as the [[Buyid dynasty]] in the western part of Persia and [[Iraq]] provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development. Under the Samanids, [[Bukhara]] rivaled [[Baghdad]] as a cultural capital of the [[Islamic world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Iran |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=9106324 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |last=Afary |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Afary}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the study of the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] thrived. Philosophy, [[Fiqh]] and [[theology]] ([[kalaam]]) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. [[Al-Razi]] and [[Al-Farabi]] had provided [[methodology]] and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of [[Balkh]], [[Khwarezm]], [[Gorgan]], [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Hamadan]]. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. [[Aruzi Samarqandi]] describes how before Avicenna left [[Khwarezm]] he had met [[Al-Biruni]] (a famous scientist and astronomer), [[Abu Nasr Mansur|Abu Nasr Iraqi]] (a renowned mathematician), [[Abu Sahl Masihi]] (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).

=== Early life ===
Avicenna was born {{c.|lk=no|980}} in Afshana, a village near [[Bukhara]] (in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]), the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Samanids]], a Persian [[dynasty]] in [[Central Asia]] and [[Greater Khorasan]].

After five years, his younger brother, Mahmoud, was born.

According to his autobiography, Avicenna had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorised the entire Quran]] by the age of 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=The Canon of Medicine (work by Avicenna) |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine |accessdate=2008-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528230506/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine |archivedate=28 May 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned [[Indian mathematics|Indian arithmetic]] from an [[History of India|Indian]] greengrocer, Mahmoud Massahi&lt;ref&gt;Khorasani Sharaf, Islamic Great Encyclopedia, vol. 1. p. 1 1367 solar&lt;/ref&gt; and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He also studied [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) under the [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] scholar Ismail al-Zahid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gracia&quot;&gt;Jorge J.E. Gracia and Timothy B. Noone (2003), ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'', p. 196, [[Blackwell Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-631-21673-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as Introduction ([[Isagoge]])'s [[Porphyry (philosopher)]], [[Euclid's Elements]], [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Almagest]] by an unpopular philosopher, Abu Abdullah Nateli, who claimed philosophizing.&lt;ref&gt;Sharaf Khorasani, Islamic Great encyclopedia, vol. 1. p. 1 1367 solar&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' of [[Aristotle]], which he could not understand until he read [[al-Farabi]]'s commentary on the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbin1993&quot; /&gt; For the next year and a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite [[wudu|ablutions]], then go to the mosque, and continue in [[salat|prayer]] till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the ''Metaphysics'' of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure to him until he purchased a brief commentary by al-Farabi from a bookstall for three dirhams (a very low price at the time). So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Avicenna|volume=3|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He turned to medicine at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18,&lt;ref name=Britannica2008 /&gt; and found that &quot;Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like mathematics and metaphysics, so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies.&quot; The youthful physician's fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment.

A number of theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's [[madhab]] (school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence). Medieval historian Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Bayhaqī (d. 1169) considered Avicenna to be a follower of the [[Brethren of Purity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Janssens91&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=An annotated bibliography on Ibn Sînâ (1970–1989): including Arabic and Persian publications and Turkish and Russian references |last=Janssens |first=Jules L. |publisher=Leuven University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-90-6186-476-9 |pages=89–90}} excerpt: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;[Dimitri Gutas's ''Avicenna's maḏhab'' convincingly demonstrates that I.S. was a sunnî-Ḥanafî.&quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KizrKA5YJ8C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=ibn+sina+hanafi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RWb5VAGHA4&amp;sig=ZRBh96ucZNIraZlNQotllhxCF_k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F8WuTLm6MJDEsAPjn9GnDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ibn%20sina%20hanafi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Dimitri Gutas]] along with Aisha Khan and Jules J.

=== Adulthood ===
[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of Avicenna depicted in the ''Daqa’iq al-Haqa’iq'' (دقائق الحقایق &quot;Degrees of Truths&quot;) by Nasir ad-Din Rammal in the 14th century CE.]]

Avicenna's first appointment was that of physician to the [[emir]], [[Nuh II]], who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

At 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Avicenna himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Avicenna met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Avicenna lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of his treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

Avicenna subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamadãn; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

=== Later life and death ===
[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]
The remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn Sīnā's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

During these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

His friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately. He refused, however, stating that: ''&quot;I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8k3fsvGRyEC&amp;pg=PA85 |title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina): Muslim Physician And Philosopher of the Eleventh Century |last=Aisha Khan |date=2006-01-15 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-4042-0509-3 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and read through the [[Quran]] every three days until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=osler /&gt; He died in June 1037, in his fifty-six year, in the month of [[Ramadan]] and was buried in [[Hamadan]], Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;osler&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Evolution Of Modern Medicine |last=Osler |first=William |publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4191-6153-7 |page=72 |author-link=William Osler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Ibn Sīnā wrote extensively on [[early Islamic philosophy]], especially the subjects [[logic]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]], including treatises named ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics''. Most of his works were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;then the language of science in the Middle East&amp;nbsp;– and some in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]].

Avicenna's [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy|Neoplatonic]] scheme of &quot;emanations&quot; became fundamental in the  ''[[Kalam]]'' (school of theological discourse) in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A.G.

His ''Book of Healing'' became available in Europe in partial Latin translation some fifty years after its composition, under the title ''Sufficientia'', and some authors have identified a &quot;Latin Avicennism&quot; as flourishing for some time, paralleling the more influential [[Latin Averroism]], but suppressed by the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--there is apparently a whole body of scholarly controversy behind this, and you shouldn't just drop this stuff in passing as if it were factual.

=== Metaphysical doctrine ===
{{Technical|section|date=January 2014}}
Early Islamic philosophy and [[Islamic metaphysics]], imbued as it is with [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.

Following al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence cannot be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam in Britannica&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |archivedate=22 December 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C. Anawati, Ibrahim Madkour, Sa'id Zayed (Cairo, 1975), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], &quot;Avicenna and Essentialism,&quot; ''Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;753–778&lt;/ref&gt;

The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence (''mahiyya'') other than existence (''wujud''). Furthermore, It is 'One' (''wahid ahad'')&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Metaphysica of Avicenna'', trans. Parviz Morewedge (New York, 1973), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nader El-Bizri 2000&quot;&gt;Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus (''jins''), nor a definition (''hadd''), nor a counterpart (''nadd''), nor an opposite (''did''), and is detached (''bari'') from matter (''madda''), quality (''kayf''), quantity (''kam''), place (''ayn''), situation (''wad''), and time (''waqt'').&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, ''Kitab al-Hidaya'', ed. Muhammad 'Abdu (Cairo, 1874), pp.&amp;nbsp;262–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salem Mashran, ''al-Janib al-ilahi 'ind Ibn Sina'' (Damascus, 1992), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, &quot;Being and Necessity: A Phenomenological Investigation of Avicenna's Metaphysics and Cosmology,&quot; in ''Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology on the Perennial Issue of Microcosm and Macrocosm'', ed.

Avicenna's theology on metaphysical issues (''ilāhiyyāt'') has been criticized by some [[Islamic scholars]], among them [[al-Ghazali]], [[Ibn Taymiyya]], and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Qayyim, ''Eghaathat al-Lahfaan'', Published: Al Ashqar University (2003) Printed by International Islamic Publishing House: Riyadh.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} While discussing the views of the theists among the Greek philosophers, namely [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] in ''Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal'' (&quot;Deliverance from Error&quot;), al-Ghazali noted that the Greek philosophers &quot;must be taxed with unbelief, as must their partisans among the Muslim philosophers, such as Ibn Sina and al-Farabi and their likes.&quot; He added that &quot;None, however, of the Muslim philosophers engaged so much in transmitting Aristotle's lore
as did the two men just mentioned. [...] The sum of what we regard as the authentic philosophy of Aristotle, as transmitted by al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, can be reduced to three parts: a part which must be branded as unbelief; a part which must be stigmatized as innovation; and a part which need not be repudiated at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cvsp/Documents/reading_selections/CVSP%20202/Al-ghazali.pdf |title=al-Munqidh min al-Dalal |last=Ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī |first=Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad |publisher=American University of Beirut |year=1980 |location=Boston |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095350/https://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cvsp/Documents/reading_selections/CVSP%20202/Al-ghazali.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argument for God's existence ===

Avicenna made an [[argument]] for the [[existence of God]] which would be known as the &quot;[[Proof of the Truthful]]&quot; ([[Arabic]]: ''al-burhan al-siddiqin'').

=== Al-Biruni correspondence ===
Correspondence between Ibn Sina (with his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi) and [[Al-Biruni]] has survived in which they debated [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] and the [[Peripatetic school]]. Abu Rayhan began by asking Avicenna eighteen questions, ten of which were criticisms of Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rafik Berjak and Muzaffar Iqbal, &quot;Ibn Sina—Al-Biruni correspondence&quot;, ''Islam &amp; Science'', June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Avicenna was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology. His aim was to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through [[reason]] and [[logic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman-8-9&quot;&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's views on Islamic theology (and philosophy) were enormously influential, forming part of the core of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), &quot;The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy&quot;, in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-0-932885-07-4}}, Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152–198 [p. 156].&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the [[Islamic prophet|prophets]] (whom he viewed as &quot;inspired philosophers&quot;), and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran, such as how Quranic [[cosmology]] corresponds to his own philosophical system. In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.

There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), &quot;The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy&quot;, in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152–198 [pp. &amp;nbsp;160–161].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|al-Tusi]]) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as [[al-Razi]]) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as [[al-Ghazali]]) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means. It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasahs]].&lt;ref&gt;James W. Morris (1992), &quot;The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy&quot;, in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], pp. 152–198 [pp.&amp;nbsp;156–158].&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized the Quran]] by the age of ten, and as an adult, he wrote five treatises commenting on [[sura]]s from the Quran. One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Janssens (2004), &quot;Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries&quot;, ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&amp;nbsp;177–192.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Thought experiments ===
{{Main|Floating man}}
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous &quot;[[floating man|Floating Man]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;– literally falling man&amp;nbsp;– [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.&lt;ref&gt;See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45–53&lt;/ref&gt; The conceivability of this &quot;Floating Man&quot; indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:

{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul&lt;ref name=&quot;Nader El-Bizri 2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sina, ''الفن السادس من الطبيعيات من كتاب الشفاء القسم الأول'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)

However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.  Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the flying person would be &quot;I am,&quot; affirming his or her essence.  That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation. Thus, the knowledge that &quot;I am&quot; is the core of a human being:  the soul exists and is self-aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's De Anima in the Latin West |last=Hasse |first=Dag Nikolaus |publisher=Warburg Institute |year=2000 |location=London |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]].

=== Earth sciences ===
Ibn Sīnā wrote on [[Earth science]]s such as [[geology]] in ''The Book of Healing''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodfield&quot;&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[June Goodfield]] (1965), ''The Ancestry of Science: The Discovery of Time'', p. 64, [[University of Chicago Press]] (cf. [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=319 The Contribution of Ibn Sina to the development of Earth sciences])&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing the formation of [[mountain]]s, he explained:

{{quote|Either they are the effects of upheavals of the crust of the earth, such as might occur during a violent earthquake, or they are the effect of water, which, cutting itself a new route, has denuded the valleys, the strata being of different kinds, some soft, some hard&amp;nbsp;... It would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished, during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size.&lt;ref name=Goodfield /&gt;}}

=== Philosophy of science ===
In the ''Al-Burhan'' (''On Demonstration'') section of ''The Book of Healing'', Avicenna discussed the [[philosophy of science]] and described an early [[scientific method]] of [[inquiry]]. He discusses Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of &quot;How does one acquire the first principles of a science?&quot; He asked how a scientist would arrive at &quot;the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?&quot; He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a &quot;relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty&quot;. Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that &quot;it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.&quot; In its place, he develops a &quot;method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=Jon |date=July 2003 |title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam |url=https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=philosophy-faculty |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=307–327 |doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logic ===
An early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |last=Peter Øhrstrøm |last2=Per Hasle |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tony Street |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=209–228 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |last=Street |first=Tony |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |editor-last=Peter Adamson |pages=247–265 |chapter=Logic |editor-last2=Richard C. Taylor |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians such as [[Albertus Magnus]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Washell (1973), &quot;Logic, Language, and Albert the Great&quot;, ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''34''' (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;445–450 [445].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William of Ockham]].&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kneale: p. 266; Ockham: [[Summa Logicae]] i. 14; Avicenna: ''Avicennae Opera'' Venice 1508 f87rb&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle, that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used. He stated, &quot;Anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten, and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, Metaphysics, I; commenting on Aristotle, Topics I.11.105a4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In [[mechanics]], Ibn Sīnā, in ''The Book of Healing'', developed a theory of [[motion (physics)|motion]], in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and [[force]] of a [[projectile]], and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination (''mayl'') transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that [[projectile motion]] in a vacuum would not cease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinoza&quot;&gt;Fernando Espinoza (2005). &quot;An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching&quot;, ''Physics Education'' '''40''' (2), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as [[air resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sayili (1987), &quot;Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile&quot;, ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), pp. 477–482: &quot;It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of motion presented by Avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th-century Alexandrian scholar [[John Philoponus]]. Avicenna's is a less sophisticated variant of the [[theory of impetus]] developed by [[Buridan]] in the 14th century. It is unclear if Buridan was influenced by Avicenna, or by Philoponus directly.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zupko, &quot;John Buridan&quot; in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2014
([http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/notes.html#48 fn. 48])
&quot;We do not know precisely where Buridan got the idea of impetus, but a less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in Avicenna's doctrine of mayl (inclination). In this he was possibly influenced by Philoponus, who was developing the Stoic notion of hormé (impulse). For discussion, see Zupko (1997) ['What Is the Science of the Soul? A Case Study in the Evolution of Late Medieval Natural Philosophy,' Synthese, 110(2): 297–334].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optics]], Ibn Sina was among those who argued that light had a speed, observing that &quot;if the perception of [[light]] is due to the emission of some sort of [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided a wrong explanation of the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] described Avicenna's (&quot;Ibn Sīnā&quot;) theory on the rainbow as follows:

{{quote|Independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer. The cloud, he thought, serves simply as the background of this thin substance, much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror. Ibn Sīnā would change the place not only of the bow, but also of the color formation, holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Benjamin Boyer (1954). &quot;Robert Grosseteste on the Rainbow&quot;, ''Osiris'' '''11''', pp.&amp;nbsp;247–258 [248].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1253, a Latin text entitled ''Speculum Tripartitum'' stated the following regarding Avicenna's theory on [[heat]]:

{{quote|Avicenna says in his book of heaven and earth, that heat is generated from motion in external things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gutman |first=Oliver |year=1997 |title=On the Fringes of the Corpus Aristotelicum: the Pseudo-Avicenna Liber Celi Et Mundi |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |doi=10.1163/157338297X00087}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Psychology ===
Avicenna's legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the ''Kitab al-nafs'' parts of his ''Kitab al-shifa'' (''The Book of Healing'') and ''Kitab al-najat'' (''The Book of Deliverance''). These were known in Latin under the title [[De Anima]] (treatises &quot;on the soul&quot;).{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Notably, Avicenna develops what is called the [[Floating man|Flying Man]] argument in the Psychology of ''The Cure'' I.1.7 as defense of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension, which has an affinity with [[Descartes]]'s ''cogito'' argument (or what [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] designates as a form of an &quot;''epoche''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171&quot;&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, NY: Global Publications SUNY, 2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;149–171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elbizri67-89&quot;&gt;Nader El-Bizri, &quot;Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl,&quot; in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;67–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter. This process requires a concrete particular (material) to be abstracted into the universal intelligible (immaterial). The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect, which is a &quot;divine light&quot; containing the intelligible forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

=== Astronomy and astrology ===
[[File:Skulls of Avicenna.jpg|thumb|Skull of Avicenna, found in 1950 during construction of [[Avicenna Mausoleum|the new mausoleum]]]]
Avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled ''Resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm'', in which he cited passages from the Quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', pp. 60, 67–69. [[New York University Press]], {{ISBN|0-8147-8023-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that each planet had some influence on the earth, but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii |title=Avicenna |last=Saliba |first=George |authorlink=George Saliba |year=2011 |website=Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than [[Alhazen]] or [[Al-Biruni]]. One important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology.&lt;ref name=Ragep /&gt; He criticized Aristotle's view of the [[star]]s receiving their light from the [[Sun]], stating that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the [[planet]]s are also self-luminous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ariew |first=Roger |date=March 1987 |title=The phases of venus before 1610 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=81–92 |doi=10.1016/0039-3681(87)90012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have observed [[Transit of Venus|Venus as a spot on the Sun]]. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragep&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_Sina_BEA.htm |title=Ibn Sīnā: Abū ʿAlī al‐Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbdallāh ibn Sīnā |last=Sally P.

He also wrote the ''Summary of the Almagest'', (based on [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''), with an appended treatise &quot;to bring that which is stated in the Almagest and what is understood from Natural Science into conformity&quot;. For example, Avicenna considers the motion of the solar [[apogee]], which Ptolemy had taken to be fixed.&lt;ref name=Ragep /&gt;

=== Chemistry ===
Ibn Sīnā used [[steam distillation]] to produce essential oils such as rose essence, which he used as [[aromatherapeutic]] treatments for heart conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marlene&quot;&gt;Marlene Ericksen (2000). ''Healing with Aromatherapy'', p. 9.

Unlike al-Razi, Ibn Sīnā explicitly disputed the theory of the [[Philosopher's stone|transmutation of substances]] commonly believed by [[alchemy|alchemists]]:

{{quote|Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p.&amp;nbsp;196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four works on alchemy attributed to Avicenna were translated into [[Latin]] as:&lt;ref name=&quot;Anawati&quot;&gt;Georges C. Anawati (1996), &quot;Arabic alchemy&quot;, in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;853–885 [875]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{lang|la|Avicennae de congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum}}
* {{lang|la|Avicennae ad Hasan Regem epistola de Re recta}}

{{lang|la|Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae}} was the most influential, having influenced later [[medieval]] chemists and alchemists such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]]. However Anawati argues (following Ruska) that the de Anima is a fake by a Spanish author. Similarly the Declaratio is believed not to be actually by Avicenna. The third work (''The Book of Minerals'') is agreed to be Avicenna's writing, adapted from the ''Kitab al-Shifa'' (''Book of the Remedy'').&lt;ref name=Anawati /&gt;
Ibn Sina classified minerals into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts, building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Leicester |first=Henry Marshall |title=The Historical Background of Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJZVQnqcwv4C&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |year=1971 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-61053-5 |quote=There was one famous Arab physician who doubted even the reality of transmutation.

In the physical section of this work he discusses the formation of minerals, which he classifies into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts. Mercury is classified with the fusible substances, metals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''epistola de Re recta'' is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible.&lt;ref name=Anawati /&gt;

Robert Wisnovsky, a scholar of Avicenna attached to the [[McGill University]], says that &quot;Avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in Islam, particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic and medicine&quot; but that his works didn't only have an influence in these &quot;secular&quot; fields of knowledge alone, as &quot;these works, or portions of them, were read, taught, copied, commented upon, quoted, paraphrased and cited by thousands of post-Avicennian scholars — not only philosophers, logicians, physicians and specialists in the mathematical or exact sciences, but also by those who specialized in the disciplines of [[Kalam|ʿilm al-kalām]] (rational theology, but understood to include [[natural philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of mind]]) and [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|usūl al-fiqh]] (jurisprudence, but understood to include philosophy of law, dialectic, and [[philosophy of language]]).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wisnovsky, &quot;Indirect Evidence for Establishing the Text of the Shifā&quot; in ''Oriens'', volume 40, issue 2 (2012), pp. 257-258&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avicenna Mausoleum interior.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside view of the Avicenna Mausoleum, designed by [[Hooshang Seyhoun]] in 1945–1950]]

As early as the 13th century when [[Dante Alighieri]] depicted him in Limbo alongside the virtuous non-Christian thinkers in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' such as [[Virgil]], [[Averroes]], [[Homer]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Saladin]]. Avicenna has been recognized by both East and West, as one of the great figures in intellectual history.

[[George Sarton]], the author of ''The History of Science'', described Ibn Sīnā as &quot;one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history&quot;&lt;ref name=Zahoor&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science''.&lt;br /&gt;([[cf.]] Dr. A. Zahoor and Dr. Z. Haq (1997). [http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/Introl1.html Quotations From Famous Historians of Science], Cyberistan.)&lt;/ref&gt; and called him &quot;the most famous [[Islamic science|scientist of Islam]] and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times.&quot; He was one of the Islamic world's leading writers in the field of medicine.

Along with [[al-Razi|Rhazes]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]], and [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|al-Ibadi]], Ibn Sīnā is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western [[history of medicine]] as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European [[Renaissance]]. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Avicenna Medicine and Biology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x |accessdate=2011-11-09 |last=Musallam |first=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the ''Canon of Medicine'' (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the ''Canon'' was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, {{lang|la|princeps medicorum}} (&quot;prince of physicians&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Avicenna The influence of Avicenna on medical studies in the West |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x |accessdate=2011-11-09 |last=Weisser |first=U.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arabic works ==
The treatises of Ibn Sīnā influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna&quot; /&gt;
His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.

Ibn Sīnā wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.  His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; though  ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Ibn Sīnā's world;
Arabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Ibn Sīnā was attempting to &quot;re-Aristotelianise&quot; Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.

The ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).&lt;ref&gt;Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science &amp; Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Two encyclopedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio''). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a {{lang|ar|حكمت مشرقيه|rtl=yes}} (''hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya'', in Latin ''Philosophia Orientalis''), mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

== Persian works ==

Avicenna's most important [[Persian language|Persian]] work is the ''Danishnama-i 'Alai'' ({{lang|fa|دانشنامه علائی}}, &quot;the Book of Knowledge for [Prince] 'Ala ad-Daulah&quot;). Avicenna created new scientific vocabulary that had not previously existed in Persian. The Danishnama covers such topics as logic, metaphysics, music theory and other sciences of his time. It has been translated into English by Parwiz Morewedge in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna, Danish Nama-i 'Alai. trans. Parviz Morewedge as ''The Metaphysics of Avicenna'' (New York: Columbia University Press), 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is also important in respect to Persian scientific works.

''Andar Danesh-e Rag'' ({{lang|fa|اندر دانش رگ}}, &quot;On the Science of the Pulse&quot;) contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is a condensed synopsis.

[[Persian poetry]] from Ibn Sina is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]''.
