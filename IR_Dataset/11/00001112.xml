The '''economy of American Samoa''' is a traditional [[Polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEMA&quot;/&gt; Economic activity is strongly linked to the United States, with which [[American Samoa]] conducts the great bulk of its [[foreign trade]]. [[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. [[Tourism]], a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in [[East Asia]].
