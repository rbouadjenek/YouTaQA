The heritage of the [[Classical Greece|classical era]] is still evident in the city, represented by [[ancient monument]]s and works of art, the most famous of all being the [[Parthenon]], considered a key landmark of early [[Western culture|Western civilization]].

Athens is home to two [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and the medieval [[Daphni Monastery]]. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the [[Old Royal Palace|Hellenic Parliament]] and the so-called &quot;architectural trilogy of Athens&quot;, consisting of the [[National Library of Greece]], the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]].

Athens was the host city of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern-day Olympic Games]] in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], making it one of only a handful of cities to have hosted the Olympics more than once.&lt;ref name=oly&gt;{{cite news|title=Sentiment a factor as Athens gets 2004 Olympics |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/1997/09/05/athens_update/ |author=((CNN &amp; Sports Illustrated)) |publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=5 September 1997 |accessdate=28 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519032341/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/1997/09/05/athens_update/ |archivedate=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], the name of the city was {{lang|grc|Ἀθῆναι}} (''Athênai'', {{IPA-grc|atʰɛ̂ːnai̯|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as [[Homeric Greek]], the name had been current in the singular form though, as {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}} (''Athḗnē'').&lt;ref&gt;As for example in [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135 Od.7.80].&lt;/ref&gt; It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of {{lang|grc|Θῆβαι}} (''[[Thebes, Greece|Thêbai]]'') and {{lang|grc|Μυκῆναι}} (''[[Mycenae|Μukênai]]''). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beekes2009&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Beekes|first=Robert S. P.|authorlink=Robert Beekes|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden and Boston|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is possibly a remnant of the [[Pre-Greek substrate]] of Attica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beekes2009&quot;/&gt; In antiquity, it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess [[Athena]] ([[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnâ'', [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athḗnē'', and [[Doric Greek|Doric]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athā́nā'') or Athena took her name from the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert1985&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|date=1985|title=Greek Religion|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-36281-0|page=139|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert1985&quot;/&gt; because the ending -''ene'' is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert1985&quot;/&gt; During the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as {{lang|el|Ἀθήνα}}. However, after the establishment of the modern Greek state, and partly due to the conservatism of the written language, {{lang|el|Ἀθῆναι}} {{IPA-el|aˈθine|}} became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of [[Katharevousa]] in the 1970s, when Ἀθήνα, ''Athína'', became the official name.

According to the ancient Athenian [[founding myth]], Athena, the goddess of wisdom, competed against [[Poseidon]], the God of the Seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Kerényi|first=Karl|authorlink=Károly Kerényi|title=The Gods of the Greeks|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London, England|date=1951|isbn=0-500-27048-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/godsofgreeks00kerrich/page/124 124]|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/godsofgreeks00kerrich/page/124}}&lt;/ref&gt; they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt; and appointed [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the king of Athens, as the judge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt; According to the account given by [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], Poseidon struck the ground with his [[Trident of Poseidon|trident]] and a salt water spring welled up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt; In an alternative version of the myth from [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt; In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated [[olive tree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cecrops accepted this gift&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt; and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerényi1951&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland2008&quot;/&gt;

Different etymologies, now commonly rejected, were proposed during the 17th century. [[Christian Lobeck]] proposed as the root of the name the word {{lang|grc|ἄθος}} (''áthos'') or {{lang|grc|ἄνθος}} (''ánthos'') meaning &quot;flower&quot;, to denote Athens as the &quot;flowering city&quot;. [[Johann Christoph Wilhelm Ludwig Döderlein|Ludwig von Döderlein]] proposed the stem of the verb {{lang|grc|θάω}}, stem θη- (''tháō'', ''thē-'', &quot;to suck&quot;) to denote Athens as having fertile soil.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Great Greek Encyclopedia]]'', vol. II, Athens 1927, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical literature, the city was sometimes referred to as the [[City of the Violet Crown]], first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (''iostéphanoi Athânai''), or as {{lang|grc|τὸ κλεινὸν ἄστυ}} (''tò kleinòn ásty'', &quot;the glorious city&quot;). In medieval texts, variant names include Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving [[false splitting]] of prepositional phrases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourne1887&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

{{Main|History of Athens|Timeline of Athens}}

The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.&lt;ref name=ethnos.gr/&gt; Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;S. Immerwahr, The Athenian Agora XIII: the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, Princeton 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tung/&gt; By 1400&amp;nbsp;BC the settlement had become an important centre of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major [[Mycenae]]an fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic [[Cyclopean]] walls.&lt;ref&gt;Iakovides, S. 1962. 'E mykenaïke akropolis ton Athenon'. Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as [[Mycenae]] and [[Pylos]], it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200&amp;nbsp;BC, an event often attributed to a [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure [[Ionians]] with no Dorian element. However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.

[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900&amp;nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200–479&amp;nbsp;BC''.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].

By the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&amp;nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&amp;nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&amp;nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being [[Achaemenid destruction of Athens|captured and sacked twice]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&amp;pg=PA34|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|accessdate=24 December 2014|isbn=978-1400834303|last1=Lewis|first1=John David|date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.

The decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404&amp;nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival [[Sparta]].

By the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&amp;nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a [[free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century CE, ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].

By the end of [[Late Antiquity]], Athens had shrunk due to sacks by the [[Herulians]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Early Slavs]] which caused massive destruction in the city. In this era, the first Christian churches were built in Athens, and the [[Parthenon]] and other temples were converted into churches. Athens expanded its settlement in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.

Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.

In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

==Geography==
Athens sprawls across the central plain of [[Attica]] that is often referred to as the ''Athens or Attica Basin'' ([[Modern Greek|Greek]]: Λεκανοπέδιο Αττικής). The basin is bounded by four large mountains: [[Mount Aigaleo]] to the west, Mount [[Parnitha]] to the north, [[Mount Pentelicus]] to the northeast and Mount [[Hymettus]] to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Focus on Athens&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanheatisland.info/images/newsletter/UHI_newsletter_Issue_1.pdf|title=Focus on Athens|accessdate=18 March 2011|work=UHI Quarterly Newsletter, Issue 1, May 2009, page 2|publisher=www.urbanheatisland.info|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722204815/http://www.urbanheatisland.info/images/newsletter/UHI_newsletter_Issue_1.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the [[Thriasian plain]], which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The [[Saronic Gulf]] lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains ({{convert|1413|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parnitha-np.gr/welcome.htm |title=Welcome!!! |publisher=Parnitha-np.gr |accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been declared a [[national park]].

Athens is built around a number of hills. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]] is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The meteorology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a [[inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.&lt;ref name=tung/&gt; This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and [[Mexico City]] also suffer from similar atmospheric inversion problems.&lt;ref name=tung&gt;{{cite book |last=Tung |first=Anthony |chapter=The City the Gods Besieged |title=Preserving the World's Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/preservingworlds00anth |chapter-url-access=registration |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-609-80815-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/preservingworlds00anth/page/266 266]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] river, the [[Ilisos]] and the [[Eridanos (Athens)|Eridanos]] stream are the historical rivers of Athens.

By the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister of Culture]], Constantine Trypanis, &quot;...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918645,00.html |title=Acropolis: Threat of Destruction |publisher=Time.com |work=Time Magazine |date=31 January 1977 |accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or ''nefos'' as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.

Measures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless,  air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days.

The major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have greatly improved [[water quality]] in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers. In January 2007, Athens faced a waste management problem when its [[landfill]] near [[Ano Liosia]], an Athenian suburb, reached capacity.&lt;ref name=overflow&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/819945/rot_sets_in_as_athenss_trash_problem_mounts/index.html |title=Rot sets in as Athens's trash problem mounts |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065511/http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/819945/rot_sets_in_as_athenss_trash_problem_mounts/index.html |archivedate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis eased by mid-January when authorities began taking the garbage to a temporary landfill.&lt;ref name=overflow/&gt;

==Climate==
Athens has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''). The dominant feature of Athens’ climate is alternation between prolonged hot and dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/aber/2011/00000005/00000001/art00001|title=Founda D.

Advances in Building Energy Research, 5,1, 7–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an average of {{convert|455|mm|in}} of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between the months of October and April. July and August are the driest months when thunderstorms occur sparsely. Furthermore, some coastal areas of Athens, known as the [[Athens Riviera]] have a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') according to the climate atlas published by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (H.N.M.S).&lt;ref name=&quot;Κλιματικός Άτλαντας Ελλάδας (Ε.Μ.Υ)&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hnms.gr:80/hnms/greek/pdf/Climate_Atlas_Of_Greece.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921184739/http://www.hnms.gr/hnms/greek/pdf/Climate_Atlas_Of_Greece.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 September 2017 | title=Climate Atlas of Greece | publisher=Hellenic National Meteorological Service | accessdate=30 December 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the Pindus Mountains, annual precipitation of Athens is lower than most other parts of Greece, especially western Greece. As an example, [[Ioannina]] receives around {{convert|1300|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year, and [[Agrinio]] around {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year.

[[File:Atenas, Tumba del Soldado Desconocido 3.jpg|alt=|thumb|Changing of the [[Presidential Guard (Greece)|Greek Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Athens)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at [[Syntagma Square]].]]
The municipality of Athens, the city centre of the Athens Urban Area, is divided into several districts: [[Omonoia Square|Omonoia]], [[Syntagma Square|Syntagma]], [[Exarcheia]], Agios Nikolaos, Neapolis, [[Mount Lycabettus|Lykavittos]], Lofos Strefi, Lofos Finopoulou, Lofos Filopappou, [[Pedion tou Areos|Pedion Areos]], [[Metaxourgeio]], Aghios Kostantinos, [[Larissa Station]], [[Kerameikos]], [[Psiri]], [[Monastiraki]], [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]], [[Thiseio|Thission]], [[Church of Panaghia Kapnikarea|Kapnikarea]], Aghia Irini, Aerides, Anafiotika, [[Plaka]], [[Acropolis]], [[Pnyx|Pnyka]], Makrygianni, Lofos Ardittou, [[Zappeion]], Aghios Spyridon, [[Pangrati]], [[Kolonaki]], Dexameni, Evaggelismos, Gouva, Aghios Ioannis, [[Neos Kosmos, Athens|Neos Kosmos]], [[Koukaki]], Kynosargous, Fix, Ano Petralona, Kato Petralona, Rouf, [[Votanikos]], Profitis Daniil, [[Akadimia Platonos]], [[Kolonos]], Kolokynthou, Attikis Square, Lofos Skouze, Sepolia, [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]], Aghios Meletios, Nea Kypseli, Gyzi, Polygono, [[Ambelokipi, Athens|Ampelokipoi]], Panormou-Gerokomeio, Pentagono, Ellinorosson, [[Nea Filothei]], Ano Kypseli, Tourkovounia-Lofos Patatsou, Lofos Elikonos, Koliatsou, Thymarakia, Kato Patisia, Treis Gefyres, Aghios Eleftherios, [[Ano Patissia|Ano Patisia]], Kypriadou, Menidi, Prompona, Aghios Panteleimonas, [[Pangrati]], Goudi, [[Vyronas]] and Ilisia.

* '''Omonoia''', [[Omonoia Square]], ({{lang-el|Πλατεία Ομονοίας}}) is the oldest square in Athens. It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the [[Athens Metro]] and the Ilektrikos, named [[Omonoia station]]. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the [[Euro 2004]] and the [[EuroBasket 2005]] tournaments.[[File:20090801 athina04.jpg|thumb|Aiolou Street in the Centre. On the left is the building of the National Bank of Greece.]]
*'''Metaxourgeio''' ({{lang-el|Μεταξουργείο}}) is a neighborhood of Athens. The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and cafés. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as &quot;Art for art's sake&quot; (Τέχνη τέχνης χάριν). [[Guerrilla gardening]] has also helped to beautify the area.[[File:Kolonaki Square 2.jpg|thumb|Apartment buildings near Kolonaki Square.]]
* '''Psiri and Gazi''' – The reviving [[Psiri]] ({{lang-el|Ψυρρή}}) neighbourhood – also known as Athens's &quot;meat packing district&quot; – is dotted with renovated former mansions, artists' spaces, and small gallery areas. A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as &quot;rebetadika&quot;, after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.
*The [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]] ({{lang-el|Γκάζι}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's &quot;[[Gay village]]&quot;. The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station).
* '''Syntagma''', [[Syntagma Square]], ({{lang-el|Σύνταγμα}}/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and [[List of city squares by size|largest square]], lying adjacent to the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most notable [[Grande Bretagne|hotels]]. Ermou Street, an approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} pedestrian road connecting [[Syntagma Square]] to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists. Complete with fashion shops and shopping centres promoting most international brands, it now finds itself in the top five most expensive shopping streets in Europe, and the tenth most expensive retail street in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL |title=Cushman &amp; Wakefield – Global real estate solutions – News &amp; Events |publisher=Cushwake.com |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081611/http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, the renovated Army Fund building in Panepistimiou Street includes the &quot;Attica&quot; [[department store]] and several upmarket designer stores.[[File:Πλάκα 6552.jpg|thumb|Neoclassical Houses in the historical neighbourhood of Plaka.]]
*'''Plaka, Monastiraki, and Thission''' – [[Plaka]] ({{lang-el|Πλάκα}}), lying just beneath the [[Acropolis]], is famous for its plentiful [[neoclassical architecture]], making up one of the most scenic districts of the city. It remains a prime tourist destination with [[taverna]]s, live performances and street salesmen. Nearby [[Monastiraki]] ({{lang-el|Μοναστηράκι}}), for its part, is known for its string of small shops and markets, as well as its crowded [[flea market]] and tavernas specialising in [[souvlaki]]. Another district known for its student-crammed, stylish cafés is [[Temple of Hephaestus|Theseum]] or Thission ({{lang-el|Θησείο}}), lying just west of Monastiraki. Thission is home to the ancient [[Temple of Hephaestus]], standing atop a small hill. This area also has a picturesque 11th-century Byzantine church, as well as a 15th-century Ottoman mosque. 
*'''[[Exarcheia]]''' ({{lang-el|Εξάρχεια}}), located north of Kolonaki, is the location of the city's [[anarchism|anarchist]] scene and as a student quarter with cafés, bars and bookshops. Exarcheia is home to the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic]] and the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]; it also contains important buildings of several 20th-century styles: [[Neoclassicism]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modern architecture|Early Modernism]] (including [[Bauhaus]] influences).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
*'''[[Kolonaki]]''' ({{lang-el|Κολωνάκι}}) is the area at the base of [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus hill]], full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day, and bars and more fashionable restaurants by night, with galleries and museums. This is often regarded as one of the more prestigious areas of the capital.

==== Parks and zoos ====
[[File:20140410 60 Athens National Gardens (13824726745).jpg|alt=|thumb|The entrance of the [[National Garden of Athens|National Gardens]], commissioned by [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Queen Amalia]] in 1838 and completed by 1840]]
Parnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The [[National Garden of Athens]] was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and [[Zappeion]] buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.

Parts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the ''Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens'', which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.&lt;ref name=EUfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astynet.gr/ |title=Eaxa :: Ενοποιηση Αρχαιολογικων Χωρων Αθηνασ Α.Ε |publisher=Astynet.gr |accessdate=21 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228090100/http://www.astynet.gr/ |archivedate=28 February 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Dionysiou Areopagitou Street]] has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near [[Plaka]], and finishes just beyond the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Thiseio]]. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the [[Parthenon]] and the [[ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.

The hills of Athens also provide green space. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]], [[Philopappos Monument|Philopappos hill]] and the area around it, including [[Pnyx]] and [[Ardettos hill]], are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the [[Pedion tou Areos]] (''Field of Mars'') of 27.7 hectares, near the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]].

Athens' largest zoo is the [[Attica Zoological Park]], a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.

=== Urban and suburban municipalities ===

[[File:Alimos - panoramio (33).jpg|alt=|thumb|Beach in the southern suburb of [[Alimos]], one of the many beaches in the southern coast of Athens]]
The Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics1&quot;/&gt; densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the city centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including [[Agios Stefanos, Attica|Agios Stefanos]], [[Dionysos, Greece|Dionysos]], [[Ekali]], [[Nea Erythraia]], [[Kifissia]], [[Marousi|Maroussi]], [[Pefki]], [[Lykovrysi]], [[Metamorfosi]], [[Nea Ionia]], [[Nea Filadelfeia]], [[Irakleio, Attica|Irakleio]], [[Vrilissia]], [[Melissia]], [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], [[Chalandri]], [[Agia Paraskevi]], [[Galatsi]], [[Psychiko]] and [[Filothei]]); the southern suburbs (including [[Alimos]], [[Nea Smyrni]], [[Moschato]], [[Kallithea]], [[Agios Dimitrios]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Glyfada]], [[Argyroupoli]], [[Ilioupoli]], [[Voula]] and [[Vouliagmeni]]); the eastern suburbs (including [[Zografou]], [[Dafni, Attica|Dafni]], [[Vyronas]], [[Kaisariani]], [[Cholargos]] and [[Papagou]]); and the western suburbs (including [[Peristeri]], [[Ilion, Greece|Ilion]], [[Egaleo]], [[Koridallos]], [[Agia Varvara]], [[Chaidari]], [[Petroupoli]], [[Agioi Anargyroi]] and [[Kamatero]]).

The Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of [[Piraeus]] to the southernmost suburb of [[Varkiza]] for some {{convert|25|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Greece_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Piraeus%20(Attiki)&amp;toplace=Varkiza%20(Piraios%20Nomos)&amp;fromlat=37.9474464019929&amp;tolat=37.8185988001751&amp;fromlng=23.6370849609375&amp;tolng=23.7987041473389 |title=Distance between Piraeus (Attiki) and Varkiza (Piraios Nomos) (Greece) |publisher=Distancecalculator.globefeed.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also connected to the city centre by a tram.

In the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex|Olympic Complex]] (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named [[Ellinikon International Airport|Elliniko]] – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the [[Hellenikon Metropolitan Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenv.gr/hellenikon-competition/oa/en/main.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408211156/http://www.minenv.gr/hellenikon-competition/oa/en/main.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 April 2004 |work=Hellenic Ministry of the Environment and Public Works |title=Hellenikon Metropolitan Park Competition |accessdate=3 January 2007 |publisher=www.minenv.gr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the southern suburbs (such as [[Alimos]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Glyfada]], [[Voula]], [[Vouliagmeni]] and [[Varkiza]]) known as the [[Athens Riviera]], host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the [[Greek National Tourism Organization|Greek National Tourism Organisation]] and require an entrance fee. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6252676.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Greek forest fire close to Athens |work=BBC News |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car), and the nearby town of [[Loutraki]] (accessible by car via the Athens – [[Corinth]] National Highway, or the suburban rail service [[Proastiakos]]).

The large '''City Centre''' of the Greek capital falls directly within the municipality of Athens, which is the largest in population size in Greece. [[Piraeus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://distances-from.com/p/Athens-Greece-and-Piraeus-Greece |title=Distance between Athens, Greece and Piraeus, Greece |publisher=distances-from.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=8 Feb 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063612/https://distances-from.com/p/Athens-Greece-and-Piraeus-Greece |archive-date=9 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; also forms a significant city centre on its own, within the Athens Urban Area and being the second largest in population size within it, with [[Peristeri]], [[Kallithea]] and kypseli following.

=== Athens Urban Area ===
[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 36 View from Lycabettus.jpg|alt=|thumb|View of the Athens urban area and the [[Saronic Gulf]].]]

The Athens Urban Area today consists of 40 municipalities, 35 of which make up what is referred to as the Greater Athens municipalities, located within 4 regional units ([[North Athens (regional unit)|North Athens]], [[West Athens (regional unit)|West Athens]], [[Central Athens (regional unit)|Central Athens]], [[South Athens (regional unit)|South Athens]]); and a further 5, which make up the Greater Piraeus municipalities, located within the [[Piraeus (regional unit)|regional unit of Piraeus]] as mentioned above. The densely built up urban area of the Greek capital sprawls across {{convert|412|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;area&quot; /&gt; throughout the ''Attica Basin'' and has a total population of 3,074,160 (in 2011).

The Athens municipality forms the core and center of '''Greater Athens''', which consists of the Athens municipality and 34 more municipalities, divided in four [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (Central, North, South and West Athens), accounting for 2,641,511 people (in 2011)&lt;ref name=census11/&gt; within an area of {{convert|361|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=area/&gt; Until 2010, these four regional units made up the abolished [[Athens Prefecture]]. The municipality of [[Piraeus]], the historic Athenian port, with its 4 suburban municipalities make up the [[Piraeus (regional unit)|regional unit of Piraeus]], which in turn forms '''Greater Piraeus'''.

The Athens Urban Area is considered to form the city of Athens as a whole, despite its administrative divisions, which is the largest in Greece and one of the most populated urban areas in Europe.

The '''Athens Metropolitan Area''' spans {{convert|2928.717|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} within the [[Attica (region)|Attica]] region and includes a total of 58 municipalities, which are organized in seven regional units (those outlined above, along with [[East Attica]] and [[West Attica]]), having reached a population of 3,737,550 based on the preliminary results of the 2011 census. Athens and Piraeus municipalities serve as the two metropolitan centres of the Athens Metropolitan Area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ypeka.gr/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=UfCMqBJHswQ%3d&amp;tabid=367&amp;language=el-GR MASTER PLAN FOR ATHENS AND ATTICA 2021, pg 13, 24, 27, 33, 36, 89]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321062128/http://www.ypeka.gr/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=UfCMqBJHswQ%3D&amp;tabid=367&amp;language=el-GR |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some inter-municipal centres serving specific areas. For example, [[Kifissia]] and [[Glyfada]] serve as inter-municipal centres for northern and southern suburbs respectively.

=== Population in ancient times ===
[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Athens in 1600–1100&amp;nbsp;BC could have reached the size of [[Tiryns]]; that would put the population at the range of 10,000–15,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Citadel to City-State: The Transformation of Greece, 1200-700 B.C.E.|author1=Thomas, C.G.|author2=Conant, C.|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00325-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GP5cIqY--P0C|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Greek Dark Ages]] the population of Athens was around 4,000 people. In 700&amp;nbsp;BC the population grew to 10,000. In 500&amp;nbsp;BC the area probably contained 200,000 people. During the classical period the city's population is estimated from 150,000–350,000 and up to 610,000 according to [[Thucydides]]. When [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] conducted a population census in 317&amp;nbsp;BC the population was 21,000 free citizens, plus 10,000 resident aliens and 400,000 slaves. This suggests a total population of 431,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf|date=12 December 2005|title=The growth of Greek cities in the first millennium BC|author=Ian Morris|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Urbanism in the Preindustrial World: Cross-Cultural Approaches|author=Storey, G.|date=2006|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5246-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P43ChiFyVVEC|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles and the Tragedy of Athenian Democracy|author=Beer, J.|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-28946-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdaUDraNyPgC|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=After Collapse: The Regeneration of Complex Societies|author1=Schwartz, G.M.|author2=Nichols, J.J.|date=2010|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-2936-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gsFrnn9RzQC|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;umn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~okuhlke/Archive/GEOG%203762%20Student%20PDFs/Athens.pdf|date=9 December 2008|title=Urban History of Athens|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Marathon Fighters and Men of Maple: Ancient Acharnai|author=Kellogg, D.L.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166386-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMnRAgAAQBAJ|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google6&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Studies in Athenian Demography|author=Hansen, M.H.|date=1988|publisher=Commissioner, Munksgaard|isbn=9788773041895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=navdHEZqucUC|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece|author=Wilson, N.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-78800-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google8&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Regime of Demetrius of Phalerum in Athens, 317–307 BCE: A Philosopher in Politics|author=O'Sullivan, L.|date=2009|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004178885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKtYuyVToG0C|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is highly suspect because of the lopsided number of slaves and does not include free women and children and resident foreigners: an estimated based on Thucydides is: 40,000 male citizens, 100,000 family members, 70,000 metics (resident foreigners) and 150,000-400,000 slaves.  However the numbers would include Attica and not just Athens the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;umn&quot;/&gt;

The ancient site of Athens is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an [[Developed country|industrial nation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] – Retrieved on 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across [[Attica]]). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so. The table below shows the historical population of Athens in recent times.

==== Railways and ferry connections ====

Athens is the hub of the [[Hellenic Railways Organisation|country's national railway system]] (OSE), connecting the capital with major cities across Greece and abroad ([[Istanbul]], [[Sofia]] and [[Bucharest]]). The [[Port of Piraeus]] connects Athens to the numerous [[List of islands of Greece|Greek islands]] of the [[Aegean Sea]], with ferries departing, while also serving the cruise ships that arrive. [[Rafina]] and [[Lavrio]] act as alternative ports of Athens, connects the city with numerous [[List of islands of Greece|Greek islands]] of the [[Aegean Sea]], [[Euboea|Evia]] and [[Cesme]] in Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailysabah.com/business/2019/07/01/cesme-athens-ferry-services-for-passenger-freight-transport-begin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://greece.greekreporter.com/2019/03/14/turkish-company-launches-ferry-services-between-athens-and-izmir/&lt;/ref&gt; while also serving the cruise ships that arrive.

Two main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the [[Motorway 1 (Greece)|A1]]/[[European route E75|E75]], which crosses through Athens's Urban Area from [[Piraeus]], heading north towards Greece's second largest city, [[Thessaloniki]]; and the [[Olympia Odos|A8]]/[[European route E94|E94]] heading west, towards [[Patras]], which incorporated the [[Greek National Road 8A|GR-8A]]. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the [[Greek National Road 1|GR-1]] and the [[Greek National Road 8|GR-8]].

Athens' Metropolitan Area is served by the motorway network of the [[Attiki Odos]] toll-motorway (code: [[Attiki Odos|A6]]). Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of [[Eleusina|Elefsina]] to [[Athens International Airport]]; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the Attiki Odos in all its length is {{convert|65|km|mi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&amp;tag=7275 Aodos.gr]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.

== Education ==
[[File:Akademie von Athen.jpg|alt=|thumb|Facade of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]]]]
Located on [[Panepistimiou Street]], the old campus of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]], and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] form the &quot;Athens Trilogy&quot; built in the mid-19th century. Most of the university's workings have been moved to a much larger, modern campus located in the eastern suburb of [[Zografou]]. The second higher education institution in the city is the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic School]], found in Patission Street. This was the location where on 17 November 1973, more than 13 students were killed and hundreds injured inside the university during the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/25/newsid_2546000/2546297.stm |title=1973: Army deposes 'hated' Greek president |work=BBC News |accessdate=22 March 2009|date=25 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military junta]] that ruled the nation from 21 April 1967 until [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|23 July 1974]].

Other universities that lie within Athens are the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]], the [[Panteion University]], the [[Agricultural University of Athens]] and the [[University of Piraeus]]. There are overall ten state-supported Institutions of Higher (or Tertiary) education located in the Urban Area of Athens, these are by chronological order: [[Athens School of Fine Arts]] (1837), [[National Technical University of Athens]] (1837), [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] (1837), [[Agricultural University of Athens]] (1920), [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] (1920), [[Panteion University|Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences]] (1927), [[University of Piraeus]] (1938), [[Harokopio University|Harokopio University of Athens]] (1990), [[School of Pedagogical and Technological Education]] (2002), [[University of West Attica]] (2018). There are also several other private ''colleges'', as they called formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the [[American College of Greece]] and the [[University of Indianapolis – Athens Campus|Athens Campus]] of the [[University of Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thought.de/|title=ΙδιωτικάΠανεπιστήμιαστην Ελλάδα – PrivateUniversities in Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is a world centre of [[archaeology|archaeological research]]. Along with national institutions, such as the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]] and the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Archaeological Society]], there are multiple archaeological Museums including the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Cycladic Museum]], the [[Epigraphy|Epigraphic]] Museum, the [[Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum]], as well as museums at the ancient [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], [[Acropolis Museum|Acropolis]], [[Kerameikos]], and the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]].  The city is also home to the [[Democritus|Demokritos]] laboratory for [[Archaeological science|Archaeometry]], alongside regional and national archaeological authorities that form part of the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Greek Department of Culture]].
[[File:Ακαδημία Αθηνών 5242-1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Interior of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], designed by [[Theophil Hansen]].]]
Athens hosts 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|Foreign Archaeological Institutes]] which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions, each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.

=== Architecture ===
{{see also|Modern architecture in Athens}}
[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 27 Zappeion.jpg|thumb|The [[Zappeion]] Hall]]
[[File:Aigyptou Square Athens.JPG|thumb|Two apartment buildings in central Athens. The left one is a modernist building of the 1930s, while the right one was built in the 1950s.]]
Athens incorporates [[architectural style]]s ranging from [[Greek Revival architecture|Greco-Roman]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] to modern times. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.

For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].

Beginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]]. ''Ελληνική Αρχιτεκτονική Εταιρεία: Αρχιτέκτονες του 20ού αιώνα: Μέλη της Εταιρείας'', Ποταμός, Athens, 2009, p. XXV and p. XXI, {{ISBN|960-6691-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]]. ''Ελληνική Αρχιτεκτονική Εταιρεία: Αρχιτέκτονες του 20ού αιώνα: Μέλη της Εταιρείας'', Ποταμός, Athens, 2009, p. XXXI, {{ISBN|960-6691-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included [[Walter Gropius]], with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others, [[Eero Saarinen]], in his postwar design for the east terminal of the [[Ellinikon International Airport|Ellinikon Airport]].

All over the city can be found several statues or busts. Apart from the neoclassicals by [[Leonidas Drosis]] at the Academy of Athens (Plato, Socrates, Apollo, Athena), other notable include the statue of [[Theseus]] by [[Georgios Fytalis]] at Thiseion, of philhellenes like [[Lord Byron]], [[George Canning]] and [[William Gladstone]], the equestrian statue of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] by [[Lazaros Sochos]] in front of the Old Parliament, statues of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]] at the University, of [[Evangelos Zappas]] and [[Konstantinos Zappas]] at Zappeion, of [[Ioannis Varvakis]] at the National Garden, the &quot;woodbreaker&quot; by [[Dimitrios Filippotis]], the equestrian statue of [[Alexandros Papagos]] at Papagou district and various busts of fighters of Greek independence at the [[Pedion tou Areos]]. A significant landmark is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Syntagma.

The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kantádhes]] (καντάδες '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revues]], [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]], [[operettas]] and [[nocturnes]] that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.

Notable composers of [[operetta]]s or [[nocturne]]s were [[Kostas Giannidis]], [[Dionysios Lavrangas]], [[Nikos Hatziapostolou]], while [[Theophrastos Sakellaridis]]' ''The Godson'' remains probably the most popular operetta. Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly [[Drama (Art Form)|dramatic forms of Art]], they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include [[Orestis Makris]], [[Kalouta sisters]], [[Vasilis Avlonitis]], [[Afroditi Laoutari]], [[Eleni Papadaki]], [[Marika Nezer]], [[Marika Krevata]] and others. After 1930, wavering among American and European musical influences as well as the Greek musical tradition. Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[foxtrot]], some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. [[Nikos Gounaris]] was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.

In 1923, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], many [[ethnic Greeks]] from [[Asia Minor]] fled to Athens as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. They settled in poor neighborhoods and brought with them [[Rebetiko]] music, making it popular also in Greece, which became later the base for the [[Laïko]] music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tales of Orpheus&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fT5TAQAAQBAJ |title=Athens – The Truth: Searching for Mános, Just Before the Bubble Burst|publisher=Tales of Orpheus |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013|isbn=9780955209031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Mikis Theodorakis]].

In [[association football|football]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] have dominated the domestic competitions, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] made it to the [[1971 European Cup Final]], while [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] is the other member of the [[P.O.K.|big three]]. These clubs also have basketball teams; [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] six times and three respectively, whilst [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]] was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.

Other notable clubs within Athens are [[Athinaikos]], [[Panionios]], [[Atromitos F.C.|Atromitos]], [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.|Apollon]], [[Panellinios G.S.|Panellinios]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus]], [[Maroussi B.C.|Maroussi BCE]] and [[Peristeri B.C.]]. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.

The Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].

Beyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.

==== Olympic Games ====
===== 1896 Summer Olympics =====
{{Main|1896 Summer Olympics}}

The revival of the modern Olympic Games was brought forth in 1896, by Frenchman [[Pierre de Coubertin]]. Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000&lt;ref name=tung2/&gt; and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].

File:Panathenaic Stadium.jpg|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====
{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}
The [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.

===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====
{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]

Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.&lt;ref name=oly/&gt; It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.&lt;ref name=oly/&gt; Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.&lt;ref name=oly/&gt;

During the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.

Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].&lt;ref name=olyy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.&lt;ref name=olyy/&gt;

The 2004 Games were judged a success, as both security and organization worked well, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=olyy/&gt; The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5&amp;nbsp;million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5&amp;nbsp;million tickets were sold there in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=200&amp;article=13956 |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=30 March 2007 |title=Olympic ticket sales officially top 3.5-million mark |publisher=Embassy of Greece |author=Athens News Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232754/http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=200&amp;article=13956 |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 it was reported that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or are in a state of dereliction, with several [[squatting|squatter]] camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by [[vandalism]], graffiti or strewn with rubbish.&lt;ref name=yahoo08&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Martin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AjpTiz9CDw7_QtyFTlFMB0uVTZd4?slug=ro-beijinglegacy082408&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Beijing trumps Athens... and then some |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=21 March 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090928231642/http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AjpTiz9CDw7_QtyFTlFMB0uVTZd4?slug=ro-beijinglegacy082408&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns|url-status=dead |archivedate=28 September 2009}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite web|last=Itano |first=Nicole |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |title=As Olympic Glow Fades, Athens Questions $15 Billion Cost |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309025855/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |archivedate=9 March 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]] are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/features/after-the-party-what-happens-when-the-olympics-leave-town-901629.html |title=After The Party: What happens when the Olympics leave town |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906182231/http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/features/after-the-party-what-happens-when-the-olympics-leave-town-901629.html |archivedate=6 September 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAognIFQaNRhGk_sG9fHJQHVXuHw |title=Four years after Athens Greeks have Olympics blues |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806214535/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAognIFQaNRhGk_sG9fHJQHVXuHw |archivedate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerts and theatrical shows, such as those by the troupe Cirque du Soleil, have recently been held in the complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tales of Orpheus&quot;/&gt;
