'''Amino acids''' are [[organic compound]]s that contain [[amine]] (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] (-COOH) [[functional group]]s, along with a [[Substituent|side chain]] (R group) specific to each amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Lehninger4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = amino acid|date = 2015|encyclopedia = Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher = Cambridge University Press|url = https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/amino-acid|accessdate = 3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key [[Chemical element|elements]] of an amino acid are [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H), [[oxygen]] (O), and [[nitrogen]] (N), although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids.

Twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet [[codon]]s in the [[genetic code]] and are known as &quot;standard&quot; amino acids. The other two (&quot;non-standard&quot; or &quot;non-canonical&quot;) are [[selenocysteine]] (present in many [[prokaryote]]s as well as most [[eukaryote]]s, but not coded directly by [[DNA]]), and [[pyrrolysine]] (found only in some [[archea|archaea]] and one [[bacterium]]).

Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions. For example, in the [[human brain]], glutamate (standard [[glutamic acid]]) and [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]] (&quot;GABA&quot;, non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12467378&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petroff OA | title = GABA and glutamate in the human brain | journal = The Neuroscientist | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 562–73 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12467378 | doi = 10.1177/1073858402238515 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4387f5a66cc4fcb63eb015bba5038cb23e46317d }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydroxyproline]], a major component of the [[connective tissue]] [[collagen]], is synthesised from [[proline]]. [[Glycine]] is a biosynthetic precursor to [[porphyrin]]s used in [[red blood cell]]s. [[Carnitine]] is used in [[lipid|lipid transport]].

Nine proteinogenic amino acids are called &quot;[[essential amino acid|essential]]&quot; for humans because they cannot be produced from other [[chemical compound|compounds]] by the human body and so must be taken in as food. Others may be [[Essential amino acid#Essentiality vs. conditional essentiality in humans|conditionally essential]] for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between [[species]].{{efn|For example, [[ruminant]]s such as cows obtain a number of amino acids via [[microbe]]s in the  [[reticulorumen|first two stomach chambers]].}}

Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in [[nutritional supplement]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, [[animal feed|feed]], and [[food technology]]. Industrial uses include the production of [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]], [[biodegradable plastic]]s, and [[asymmetric catalysis|chiral catalysts]].

The unity of the chemical category was recognized by [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz|Wurtz]] in 1865, but he gave no particular name to it.&lt;ref&gt;Menten, P. ''Dictionnaire de chimie: Une approche étymologique et historique''. De Boeck, Bruxelles. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NKTKDgAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt; First use of the term &quot;amino acid&quot; in the English language dates from 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.etymonline.com/word/amino- | last=Harper |first=Douglas |name-list-format=vanc |work=Online Etymology Dictionary | title=amino- | accessdate = 19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the German term, ''Aminosäure'', was used earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paal C | year = 1894 | title = Ueber die Einwirkung von Phenyl‐i‐cyanat auf organische Aminosäuren | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 974–979 | doi=10.1002/cber.189402701205| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1425732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid [[hydrolysis]]. In 1902, [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and [[Franz Hofmeister]] independently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids, whereby bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another, resulting in a linear structure that Fischer termed &quot;[[peptide]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Joseph S. | last = Fruton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Contrasts in Scientific Style: Research Groups in the Chemical and Biochemical Sciences |volume=191 |year=1990 |chapter=Chapter 5- Emil Fischer and Franz Hofmeister |pages=163–165 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-191-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the structure shown at the top of the page, '''R''' represents a [[Substituent|side chain]] specific to each amino acid. The [[carbon]] atom next to the [[carboxyl group]] (which is therefore numbered 2 in the [[carbon chain]] starting from that functional group) is called the [[alpha carbon|α–carbon]].  Amino acids containing an [[amino group]] bonded directly to the alpha carbon are referred to as ''alpha amino acids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/alpha-amino%20acid|title=Alpha amino acid |work=The Merriam-Webster.com Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include amino acids such as [[proline]] which contain [[secondary amine]]s, which used to be often referred to as &quot;imino acids&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Proline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matts |first=R.

===Isomerism===

The alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature, but only when occurring in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer. The alpha carbon is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] carbon atom, with the exception of [[glycine]] which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Creighton |first=Thomas H. |name-list-format=vanc |title=Proteins: structures and molecular properties |publisher=W.

While &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in [[protein]]s during translation in the ribosome, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme [[posttranslational modification]]s after [[Translation (biology)|translation]] and [[Translocation (genetics)|translocation]] to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as [[cone snail]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisarewicz K, Mora D, Pflueger FC, Fields GB, Marí F | title = Polypeptide chains containing D-gamma-hydroxyvaline | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 127 | issue = 17 | pages = 6207–15 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15853325 | doi = 10.1021/ja050088m }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also abundant components of the [[peptidoglycan]] [[cell wall]]s of bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Heijenoort J | title = Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan | journal = Glycobiology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 25R–36R | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11320055 | doi = 10.1093/glycob/11.3.25R | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ea51cbeebc6f9ac1a088abfb7474daf6fb5680e }}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-serine may act as a [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolosker H, Dumin E, Balan L, Foltyn VN | title = D-amino acids in the brain: D-serine in neurotransmission and neurodegeneration | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 275 | issue = 14 | pages = 3514–26 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18564180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06515.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are used in [[racemic crystallography]] to create centrosymmetric crystals, which (depending on the protein) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matthews BW | title =  Racemic crystallography—easy crystals and easy structures: What's not to like? | journal = Protein Science | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1135–8 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19472321 | pmc = 2774423 | doi = 10.1002/pro.125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of [[glyceraldehyde]] from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory; &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde is levorotatory).
In alternative fashion, the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|(''S'') and (''R'') designators]] are used to indicate the ''absolute configuration''.

Amino acids are usually classified by the [[chemical property|properties]] of their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a [[weak acid]] or a [[weak base]], and a [[hydrophile]] if the side chain is [[polar molecule|polar]] or a [[hydrophobe]] if it is [[nonpolar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; The [[chemical structure]]s of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s.

===Zwitterions===
[[File:Amino acid zwitterions.svg |thumb|right|An amino acid in its (1) un-ionized and (2) zwitterionic forms]]
{{main|Zwitterion}}
The α-[[carboxylic acid]] group of amino acids is a [[weak acid]], meaning that it releases a [[Hydron (chemistry)|hydron]] (such as a [[proton]]) at moderate pH values.  In other words, carboxylic acid groups (−CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) can be [[deprotonated]] to become negatively charged [[carboxylate]]s (−CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ).  The negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at pH values greater than the [[pKa]] of the carboxylic acid group (typically around 2.2 for the 20 common amino acids; see the table of amino acid structures above).  In a complementary fashion, the α-[[amine]] of amino acids is a [[weak base]], meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate pH values.  In other words, α-amino groups (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−) can be [[protonated]] to become positively charged α-ammonium groups (&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N−).  The positively charged α-ammonium group predominates at pH values less than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4).

Because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups, they share [[Amphoterism|amphiprotic]] properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt;  Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge −1).  At a pH between 2.2 and 9.4, an amino acid typically contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right and exhibits a net zero charge.  This molecular state is known as a [[zwitterion]], from the German ''{{lang|de|Zwitter}}'' meaning &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Simmons | first1 = William J. | first2 = Gerhard | last2 = Meisenberg | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles of medical biochemistry |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-323-02942-1 |oclc= |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the left) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;). Altogether, amino acids exist as zwitterions in the solid phase and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.

===Isoelectric point===

The variation in titration curves when the amino acids can be grouped by category.{{clarify|issue=By eye, polar-uncharged, hydrophobic, and special-case curve-sets all look the same, but one AA in each of them looks different.|date=August 2017}} With the exception of tyrosine, using titration to distinguish among hydrophobic amino acids is problematic.

At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fennema OR |title=Food Chemistry 3rd Ed |publisher=CRC Press |location= |pages=327–8 |isbn=978-0-8247-9691-4 |oclc= |date=1996-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pH is known as the [[isoelectric point]] pI, so pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values and therefore have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp or Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), where pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at physiological pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point, and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.

===Proteinogenic amino acids===
{{main|Proteinogenic amino acids}} {{See also|Protein primary structure|Posttranslational modification}}

Amino acids are the structural units (monomers) that make up proteins. They join together to form short [[polymer]] chains called [[peptide]]s or longer chains called either [[polypeptides]] or [[protein]]s. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called ''[[translation (biology)|translation]]'' and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a [[ribozyme]] that is called a [[ribosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodnina MV, Beringer M, Wintermeyer W | title = How ribosomes make peptide bonds | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–6 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17157507 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2006.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the [[genetic code]] from an [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] template, which is an [[RNA]] copy of one of the organism's [[gene]]s.

Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called [[proteinogenic]] or natural amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal [[genetic code]]. The remaining 2, [[selenocysteine]] and [[pyrrolysine]], are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. [[Selenocysteine]] is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a [[SECIS element]], which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a [[stop codon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Driscoll DM, Copeland PR | title = Mechanism and regulation of selenoprotein synthesis | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–40 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12524431 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.23.011702.073318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrrolysine]] is used by some [[methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in enzymes that they use to produce [[methane]]. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krzycki JA | title = The direct genetic encoding of pyrrolysine | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 706–12 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16256420 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2005.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This UAG codon is followed by a [[PYLIS downstream sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16164991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Théobald-Dietrich A, Giegé R, Rudinger-Thirion J | title = Evidence for the existence in mRNAs of a hairpin element responsible for ribosome dependent pyrrolysine insertion into proteins | journal = Biochimie | volume = 87 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 813–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16164991 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2005.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-proteinogenic amino acids===
{{main|Non-proteinogenic amino acids}}

Aside from the 22 [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s, many ''non-proteinogenic'' amino acids are known. Those either are not found in proteins (for example [[carnitine]], [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]], [[levothyroxine]]) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, [[hydroxyproline]] and [[selenomethionine]]).

Non-proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by [[post-translational modification]], which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein.  For example, the [[carboxylation]] of [[glutamate]] allows for better binding of [[calcium in biology|calcium cations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vermeer C | title = Gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins and the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 266 | issue = 3 | pages = 625–36 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2183788 | pmc = 1131186 | doi = 10.1042/bj2660625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[collagen]] contains hydroxyproline, generated by [[hydroxylation]] of [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhattacharjee A, Bansal M | title = Collagen structure: the Madras triple helix and the current scenario | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–72 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 16036578 | doi = 10.1080/15216540500090710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the formation of [[hypusine]] in the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|translation initiation factor]] [[EIF5A]], through modification of a lysine residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park MH | title = The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–9 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16452303 | pmc = 2494880 | doi = 10.1093/jb/mvj034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a [[phospholipid]] membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blenis J, Resh MD | title = Subcellular localization specified by protein acylation and phosphorylation | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 984–9 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8129952 | doi = 10.1016/0955-0674(93)90081-Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]] and the neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]]. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the [[metabolic pathway]]s for standard amino acids&amp;nbsp;– for example, [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] occur in the [[urea cycle]], part of amino acid [[catabolism]] (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curis E, Nicolis I, Moinard C, Osowska S, Zerrouk N, Bénazeth S, Cynober L | title = Almost all about citrulline in mammals | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–205 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16082501 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-005-0235-4 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09c832642f40df505fb2b7b3d13cd10764c24529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid [[beta alanine]] (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of [[pantothenic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), a component of [[coenzyme A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coxon KM, Chakauya E, Ottenhof HH, Whitney HM, Blundell TL, Abell C, Smith AG | title = Pantothenate biosynthesis in higher plants | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 743–6 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16042590 | doi = 10.1042/BST0330743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-standard amino acids===
The 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal [[genetic code]] are called ''standard'' or ''canonical'' amino acids. A modified form of methionine ([[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]]) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called ''non-standard'' or ''non-canonical''. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but two of them are proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.

The two non-standard proteinogenic amino acids are [[selenocysteine]] (present in many non-eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and [[pyrrolysine]] (found only in some [[archaea]] and one [[bacterium]]). The incorporation of these non-standard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kryukov GV, Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Lobanov AV, Zehtab O, Guigó R, Gladyshev VN | title = Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5624 | pages = 1439–43 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12775843 | doi = 10.1126/science.1083516 | bibcode = 2003Sci...300.1439K | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&amp;context=biochemgladyshev }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] in their active sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gromer S, Urig S, Becker K | title = The thioredoxin system—from science to clinic | journal = Medicinal Research Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–89 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14595672 | doi = 10.1002/med.10051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by [[stop codon]] and [[SECIS element]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tjong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VoJw6fIISSkC p.299&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;url_The_Genetic_Codes_NCBI&quot; /&gt;

When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins, other biomolecules, or are oxidized to [[urea]] and [[carbon dioxide]] as a source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakami W, Harrington H | title = Amino acid metabolism | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 355–98 | year = 1963 | pmid = 14144484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.32.070163.002035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a [[transaminase]]; the amino group is then fed into the [[urea cycle]].

{{Further|Amino acid neurotransmitter}}

In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as [[metabolic intermediate]]s, such as in the biosynthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]] (GABA). Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:

==Uses in industry==
Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry, but their main use is as additives to [[Compound feed|animal feed]].

===Chemical synthesis===
The commercial production of amino acids usually relies on mutant bacteria that overproduce individual amino acids using glucose as a carbon source.  Some amino acids are produced by enzymatic conversions of synthetic intermediates. [[2-Aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid]] is an intermediate in one industrial synthesis of [[cysteine|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine]] for example. [[Aspartic acid]] is produced by the addition of ammonia to [[fumarate]] using a lyase.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|first1=Karlheinz |last1=Drauz |first2=Ian |last2=Grayson |first3=Axel |last3=Kleemann |first4=Hans-Peter |last4=Krimmer |first5=Wolfgang |last5=Leuchtenberger |first6=Christoph |last6=Weckbecker |name-list-format=vanc |year=2006| doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_057.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of [[glutamate]], formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. For other amino acids, plants use [[transaminase]]s to move the amino group from glutamate to another alpha-keto acids. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Jones | first1 = Russell Celyn | last2 = Buchanan | first2 = Bob B. | last3 = Gruissem | first3 = Wilhelm | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry &amp; molecular biology of plants | publisher = American Society of Plant Physiologists | location = Rockville, Md | year = 2000 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/biochemistrymole00buch/page/371 371–2] | isbn = 978-0-943088-39-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/biochemistrymole00buch/page/371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.

Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, [[homocysteine]] is formed through the [[transsulfuration pathway]] or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite [[S-adenosyl methionine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Brosnan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brosnan JT, Brosnan ME | title = The sulfur-containing amino acids: an overview | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 1636S–1640S | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16702333 | doi = 10.1093/jn/136.6.1636S }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[hydroxyproline]] is made by a [[posttranslational modification]] of [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kivirikko KI, Pihlajaniemi T | title = Collagen hydroxylases and the protein disulfide isomerase subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylases | journal = Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology | volume = 72 | issue =  | pages = 325–98 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9559057 | doi = 10.1002/9780470123188.ch9 | isbn = 9780470123188 | series = Advances in Enzymology – and Related Areas of Molecular Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microorganism]]s and plants synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]] and [[lanthionine]], which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic [[lantibiotics]] such as [[alamethicin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitmore L, Wallace BA | title = Analysis of peptaibol sequence composition: implications for in vivo synthesis and channel formation | journal = European Biophysics Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–7 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 14534753 | doi = 10.1007/s00249-003-0348-1 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c45027cf963939b0ba1db2b3f95dcb2fef8a5ba }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in plants, [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone [[ethylene#Ethylene as a plant hormone|ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander L, Grierson D | title = Ethylene biosynthesis and action in tomato: a model for climacteric fruit ripening | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 53 | issue = 377 | pages = 2039–55 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12324528 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erf072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Amino acids undergo the reactions expected of the constituent functional groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Elmore | first1 = Donald Trevor | last2 = Barrett | first2 = GC | name-list-format = vanc | title = Amino acids and peptides |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1998 |pages=48–60 |isbn=978-0-521-46827-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutteridge A, Thornton JM | title = Understanding nature's catalytic toolkit | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 622–9 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16214343 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2005.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side chains and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.

===Peptide bond formation===
{{see also|Peptide synthesis|Peptide bond}}
[[File:Peptidformationball.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|The condensation of two amino acids to form a ''[[dipeptide]]'' through a ''[[peptide bond]]''|alt=Two amino acids are shown next to each other. One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H2O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.]]

As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This [[polymerization]] of amino acids is what creates proteins. This [[condensation reaction]] yields the newly formed [[peptide bond]] and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a [[transfer RNA]] molecule through an [[ester]] bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent reaction carried out by an [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ibba M, Söll D | title = The renaissance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–7 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11375928 | pmc = 1083889 | doi = 10.1093/embo-reports/kve095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the [[ribosome]], which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lengyel P, Söll D | title = Mechanism of protein biosynthesis | journal = Bacteriological Reviews | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–301 | date = June 1969 | pmid = 4896351 | pmc = 378322 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.33.2.264-301.1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.

However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide [[glutathione]] is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu G, Fang YZ, Yang S, Lupton JR, Turner ND | title = Glutathione metabolism and its implications for health | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–92 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14988435 | doi = 10.1093/jn/134.3.489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step, [[gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase]] condenses [[cysteine]] and [[glutamic acid]] through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with [[glycine]] by [[glutathione synthetase]] to form glutathione.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meister A | title = Glutathione metabolism and its selective modification | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 263 | issue = 33 | pages = 17205–8 | date = November 1988 | pmid = 3053703 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3053703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in [[peptide synthesis|solid-phase peptide synthesis]] uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Louis A. | last1 = Carpino | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1992 | title = 1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole. An efficient peptide coupling additive |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=115 |pages=4397–8 |doi=10.1021/ja00063a082 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using [[combinatorial chemistry]]) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through [[high-throughput screening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marasco D, Perretta G, Sabatella M, Ruvo M | title = Past and future perspectives of synthetic peptide libraries | journal = Current Protein &amp; Peptide Science | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–67 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18855697 | doi = 10.2174/138920308785915209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konara S, Gagnona K, Clearfield A, Thompson C, Hartle J, Ericson C, Nelson C | title = Structural determination and characterization of copper and zinc bis-glycinates with X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Coordination Chemistry | year = 2010 | volume = 63 | issue = 19 | doi = 10.1080/00958972.2010.514336 | pages = 3335–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions.

===Catabolism===
[[File:Amino acid catabolism revised.png|thumb|300px|Catabolism of proteinogenic amino acids. Amino acids can be classified according to the properties of their main products as either of the following:&lt;ref&gt;Stipanuk, M. H. (2006). Biochemical, physiological, &amp; molecular aspects of human nutrition (2 ed.): Saunders Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* ''Glucogenic'', with the products having the ability to form [[glucose]] by [[gluconeogenesis]]
&lt;br /&gt;* ''Ketogenic'', with the products not having the ability to form glucose. These products may still be used for [[ketogenesis]] or [[lipid synthesis]].
&lt;br /&gt;* Amino acids catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic products.]]
Amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via [[amino acid transporter]]s, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, occurring in the liver and kidneys, often involves [[deamination]] by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming [[glutamate]]. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the [[urea cycle]] and is excreted in the form of [[urea]]. However, amino acid degradation can produce [[uric acid]] or ammonia instead. For example, [[serine dehydratase]] converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.&lt;ref name = &quot;Stryer_2002&quot; /&gt; After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering [[glycolysis]] or the [[citric acid cycle]], as detailed in image at right.

===Complexation===
Amino acids are bidentate ligands, forming [[transition metal amino acid complexes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |authors=Severin, K.; Bergs, R.; Beck, W.|title=Bioorganometallic Chemistry-Transition Metal Complexes with α-Amino Acids and Peptides|year=1998|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1635–1654|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19980703)37:12&lt;1634::AID-ANIE1634&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[File:AAcomplexation.png|420 px]]

==Physicochemical properties of amino acids==
The ca. 20 canonical amino acids can be classified according to their properties. Important factors are charge, [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]] or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], size, and functional groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; These properties are important for [[protein structure]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in [[biochemistry]], a residue refers to a specific [[monomer]] within the [[polymer|polymeric chain]] of a [[polysaccharide]], [[protein]] or [[nucleic acid]].) The [[integral membrane protein]]s tend to have outer rings of exposed [[hydrophobic]] amino acids that anchor them into the [[lipid bilayer]]. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some [[peripheral membrane protein]]s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. There are different [[hydrophobicity scale]]s of amino acid residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Urry DW | title = The change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association: Derivation and evaluation by means of inverse temperature transitions | journal = Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 399 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 177–83 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/S0009-2614(04)01565-9 | bibcode = 2004CPL...399..177U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some amino acids have special properties such as [[cysteine]], that can form covalent [[disulfide bond]]s to other cysteine residues, [[proline]] that forms [[cyclic compound|a cycle]] to the polypeptide backbone, and [[glycine]] that is more flexible than other amino acids.

Many proteins undergo a range of [[posttranslational modification]]s, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic [[lipoprotein]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magee T, Seabra MC | title = Fatty acylation and prenylation of proteins: what's hot in fat | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–6 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15780596 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2005.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydrophilic [[glycoprotein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pilobello KT, Mahal LK | title = Deciphering the glycocode: the complexity and analytical challenge of glycomics | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–5 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17500024 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid [[palmitic acid]] to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smotrys JE, Linder ME | title = Palmitoylation of intracellular signaling proteins: regulation and function | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 559–87 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15189153 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unk''' is sometimes used instead of '''Xaa''', but is less standard.

In addition, many [[Non-proteinogenic amino acids|non-standard amino acids]] have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as [[Bortezomib]] and [[MG132]], are [[peptide synthesis|artificially synthesized]] and retain their [[protecting group]]s, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is [[pyrazinoic acid|Pyz]]-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is [[Carboxybenzyl|Z]]-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure, [[photo-reactive amino acid analog]]s are available. These include [[photoleucine]] ('''pLeu''') and [[photomethionine]] ('''pMet''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suchanek M, Radzikowska A, Thiele C | title = Photo-leucine and photo-methionine allow identification of protein-protein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–7 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15782218 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
