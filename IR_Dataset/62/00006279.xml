The '''Capetian dynasty''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|iː|ʃ|ən}}), also known as the [[House of France]], is a [[dynasty]] of [[Franks|Frankish]] origin, and a branch of the [[Robertians]]. It is among the largest and oldest [[dynasty|royal houses]] in Europe and the world, and consists of [[Hugh Capet]], the founder of the dynasty, and his male-line descendants, who ruled in France without interruption from 987 to 1792, and again from 1814 to 1848. The senior line ruled in France as the [[House of Capet]] from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1328. That line was succeeded by [[cadet branch]]es, the Houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and then [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], which ruled without interruption until the [[French Revolution]] abolished the monarchy in 1792. The Bourbons were restored in 1814 in the aftermath of [[Napoleon]]'s defeat, but had to vacate the throne again in 1830 in favor of the last Capetian monarch of France, [[Louis Philippe I]], who belonged to the [[House of Orléans]].  

The dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own [[demesne]], the [[Île-de-France]], the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see ''[[Crown lands of France]]''.

Members of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic, and the early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader Kings – [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]], [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]], and [[Philip III of France|Philip III]]. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. Philip III's son and successor, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], humiliated a pope and brought the [[Avignon Papacy|papacy under French control]]. The later Valois, starting with [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], ignored religious differences and [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|allied]] with the [[Ottoman Sultanate|Ottoman Sultan]] to counter the growing power of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.

The Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the King of France are given [[appanage]]s for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. As a result, the Capetians have reigned at different times in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and as Emperors of the [[Latin Empire]].

In modern times, King [[Felipe VI of Spain]] is a member of this family, while Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri of Luxembourg]] is of relation to the family by [[agnatic kinship]]; both through the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon branch]] of the dynasty. Along with the [[House of Habsburg]], it was one of the two most powerful [[continental Europe]]an royal families, dominating European politics for nearly five centuries.

== Name origins and usage ==
The name of the dynasty derives from its founder, [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh]], who was known as &quot;Hugh Capet&quot;. The meaning of &quot;Capet&quot; (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with &quot;cape&quot;, other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word ''caput'' (&quot;head&quot;), and explain it as meaning &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;head&quot;.{{citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Historians in the 19th century (see [[House of France]]) came to apply the name &quot;Capetian&quot; to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name &quot;Capet&quot; has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the [[House of Capet]]. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned [[King Louis XVI]] (a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Queen Marie Antoinette]] (a member of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]) were referred to as &quot;Louis and Antoinette Capet&quot; (the queen being addressed as &quot;the Widow Capet&quot; after the execution of her husband).

==Capetian miracle==
[[File:HugoKapet kronika.jpg|thumb|12th-century portrait of Hugh Capet. His direct descendants ruled France for many centuries.]] 
The '''Capetian Miracle''' ({{Lang-fr|Miracle capétien}}) refers to the dynasty's ability to attain and hold onto the French crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Naus |first1=James |title=Constructing kingship : the Capetian monarchs of France and the early Crusades |date=2016 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=9780719090974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 987, [[Hugh Capet]] was elected to succeed [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty that had ruled France for over three centuries. By a process of associating elder sons with them in the kingship, the early Capetians established the hereditary succession in their family and transformed a theoretically electoral kingship to a sacral one. By the time of [[Philip II Augustus]], who became king in 1180, the Capetian hold on power was so strong that the practice of associate kingship was dropped. While the Capetian monarchy began as one of the weakest in Europe, drastically eclipsed by the new Anglo-Norman realm in England (who, as Dukes of [[Normandy]], were technically their vassals) and even other [[Peerage of France|great lords of France]], the political value of orderly succession in the Middle Ages cannot be overstated. The orderly succession of power from father to son over such a long period of time meant that the French monarchs, who originally were essentially just the direct rulers of the [[Île-de-France]], were able to preserve and extend their power, while over the course of centuries the great peers of the realm would eventually lose their power in one succession crisis or another.

By comparison, the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] was constantly beset with internal succession disputes because each generation only produced female heirs. Even the English monarchy encountered severe succession crises, such as [[The Anarchy]] of the 1120s between Stephen and Matilda, and the murder of [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany]], the primogeniture heir of [[Richard I of England]]. The latter case would deal a severe blow to the prestige of [[John of England|King John]], leading to the eventual destruction of Angevin hegemony in France. In contrast, the French kings were able to maintain uncontested father-to-son succession from the time of Hugh Capet until the succession crisis which began the [[Hundred Years' War]] of the 14th century.

== The Robertians and before ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
{{Capetian Cadets}}
{{Main|Robertians}}
The dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is &quot;Robertians&quot; or &quot;Robertines.&quot; The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, [[Robert the Strong]] (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of [[Robert III of Worms]] (b. 800) and grandson of [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county [[Hesbaye]], around [[Tongeren]] in modern-day Belgium.

The sons of Robert the Strong were [[Odo of France|Odo]] and [[Robert I of France|Robert]], who both ruled as king of [[Western Francia]]. The family became [[Count of Paris|Counts of Paris]] under Odo and Dukes of the [[Franks]] under Robert, possessing large parts of [[Neustria]].

The Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of [[Louis V of France|Louis V]]. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, [[Hugh Capet]], was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at [[Noyon]] on 3 July 987 with the full support from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the ''Capetians,'' with the Capetian dynasty and its cadet branches such as the [[House of Valois]] ruling France for more than 800 years (987–1848, with some interruptions&lt;ref&gt;Specific periods of reign are 888–898, 922–923, 987–1792, 1814–1815, and 1815–1848 – the more-than-800-year uninterrupted period 987–1792 forming the bulk.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Capetians through history ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Over the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from [[monarchy|kingdoms]] to [[Manorialism|manors]].

=== Salic law ===
[[Salic law]], reestablished during the [[Hundred Years' War]] from an ancient [[Salian Franks|Frankish]] tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male ([[Agnatic succession|agnatic]]) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.

Without Salic law, upon the death of [[John I of France|John I]], the crown would have passed to his half-sister, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]] (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.

In 1328, King [[Charles IV of France]] died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], the late king's first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. [[Isabella of France]], sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, [[Edward III of England]]. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.

Thus the French crown passed from the [[House of Capet]] after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] to [[Philip VI of France]] of the [[House of Valois]], a [[cadet branch]] of the Capetian dynasty,
*then to Louis II, Duke of Orléans, of the Orléans branch of the Valois, who became [[Louis XII of France]],
*then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoulème, who became [[Francis I of France]], and his descendants, of the Orléans-Angoulème,
*then to Henry III of Navarre, who became [[Henry IV of France]], of the [[House of Bourbon]], a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.

This did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, [[Navarre]], and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available [[#Senior Capets|below]].

=== Capetian cadet branches ===
The Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most. This list of cadet branches shows most of the Capetian cadet lines and designating their royal French progenitor, although some sub-branches are not shown.

== Senior Capets ==
Throughout most of history, the '''Senior Capet''' and the [[King of France]] were synonymous terms. Only in the time before [[Hugh Capet]] took the crown for himself and after the reign of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] is the term necessary to identify which. However, since primogeniture and the [[Salic law]] provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the [[Legitimist]] pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as ''Robertians'', not ''Capetians''.

== The Capetian dynasty today ==
Many years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven [[pretender]]s represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou|Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon]], known by his supporters as [[Duke of Anjou]], who also holds the [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.

Except for the [[House of Braganza]] (founded by an [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|illegitimate son]] of King [[John I of Portugal]], who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.

=== Current Capetian rulers ===
* [[Henri of Luxembourg|Henri]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] (since 2000)
*[[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]], [[King of Spain]] (since 2014)

=== Current Capetian pretenders ===
* [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou]], [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') pretender to France since 1989.
* [[Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria]], Calabrian pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 2015.
* [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], Castroist pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 2008.
* [[Carlos, Duke of Parma]], pretender to Parma since 2010.
* [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]], [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to Spain since 1979.
* [[Prince Jean, Duke of Vendôme]], [[Orléanist]] pretender to France since 2019.
* [[Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza]], Petrópolis pretender to Brazil since 2007.
* [[Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza]], Vassouras pretender to Brazil since 1981.
* [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], pretender to Portugal since 1976.

== Current numbers ==
{{see also|Royal descent}}
It is estimated that the agnatic (male line) descendants of the Capetian dynasty consists of 6,500 people (dead and alive){{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}.

The small number of agnatic descendants of the kings of France, compared with a theoretical number, is explained by the frequent marriages between Capetian cousins between the 12th and 20th centuries. Some examples of considerable inbreeding among descendants of the kings of France are:

*[[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], who, instead of having 1024 ancestors in the 11th generation, only had 111 distinct ancestors; {{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}
*[[Louis XIV of France]] is descended 368 times from [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] (out of his total 1159 ancestors in the 12th generation); and
*The four grandparents of the [[Henri, Count of Paris (1908–1999)]] were all of the House of Orleans, all cousins and all grandchildren of [[Louis Philippe I]].
