==Personal life==
=== Early years ===
[[File:Statue-of-Gauss-in-Braunschweig.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Gauss at his birthplace, [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]]]
Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick (Braunschweig)]], in the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] (now part of [[Lower Saxony]], Germany), to poor, working-class parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;wichita state&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/gauss.html|title=Carl Friedrich Gauss|publisher=Wichita State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the [[Ascension of Jesus|Feast of the Ascension]] (which occurs 39 days after Easter). Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of [[Computus|finding the date of Easter]], deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://american_almanac.tripod.com/gauss.htm|title=Mind Over Mathematics: How Gauss Determined The Date of His Birth|website=american_almanac.tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was christened and [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in a church near the school he attended as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Chamberless |url=http://www.gausschildren.org/genwiki/index.php?title=Letter:WORTHINGTON,_Helen_to_Carl_F._Gauss_-_1911-07-26 |title=Letter:WORTHINGTON, Helen to Carl F. Gauss – 26 July 1911 |publisher=Susan D. Chambless |date=11 March 2000 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss was a [[child prodigy]]. In his memorial on Gauss, [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] says that when Gauss was barely three years old he corrected a math error his father made; and that when he was seven, he confidently solved an [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetic series]] problem faster than anyone else in his class of 100 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Waltershausen|first= Wolfgang Sartorius von |date=1856|title= Gauss zum Gedächtniss|p= 12 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_h_Q5AAAAcAAJ|language=German|publisher= S. Hirzel }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions of this story have been retold since that time with various details regarding what the series was – the most frequent being the classical problem of adding all the integers from 1 to 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/178 178]|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gauss, Carl Friedrich (1777–1855).&quot; (2014).

Abington, United Kingdom: Helicon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hayesreckoning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brian Hayes |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/gausss-day-of-reckoning/ |title=Gauss's Day of Reckoning|journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=3 |page=200 |doi=10.1511/2006.3.200 |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first groundbreaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', in 1798, at the age of 21—though it was not published until 1801.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.

Gauss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt; who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now [[Braunschweig University of Technology]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; which he attended from 1792 to 1795,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/178 178–9]|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[University of Göttingen]] from 1795 to 1798.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/179 179]|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Gauss}}&lt;/ref&gt; His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular [[polygon]] can be constructed by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]] if the number of its sides is the product of distinct [[Fermat number|Fermat primes]] and a [[exponentiation|power]] of 2.{{efn|Gauss stated without proof that this condition was also necessary, but never published his proof. A full proof of necessity was given by [[Pierre Wantzel]]. See the [[Constructible polygon]] article for further discussion.}} This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career.
Gauss was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his tombstone. The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Theoni, ''Mathematical Snippets'', 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1796 was productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Gauss §§365–366 in ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''. Leipzig, Germany, 1801. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]], 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; He further advanced [[modular arithmetic]], greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers.

Gauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the note: &quot;[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ]]! {{nowrap|num {{=}} Δ + Δ' + Δ&quot;}}. On 1 October he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in [[finite field]]s, which 150 years later led to the [[Weil conjectures]].

=== Later years and death ===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss on his Deathbed, 1855.jpg|thumb|Gauss on his deathbed (1855)]]
[[File:Grave of Carl Friedrich Gauß at Albani-Friedhof Göttingen 2017 02.jpg|thumb|Gauss's gravesite at [[Albanifriedhof|Albani Cemetery]] in [[Göttingen]], Germany]]
Gauss remained mentally active into his old age, even while suffering from [[gout]] and general unhappiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; For example, at the age of 62, he taught himself Russian.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

In 1840, Gauss published his influential ''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Bühler1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a [[paraxial approximation]] ([[Gaussian optics]]).&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;{{Cite book|title=Optics|first=Eugene|last=Hecht|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1987|isbn=978-0-201-11609-0|ref=harv|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its [[Cardinal point (optics)|cardinal points]]&lt;ref name=Bass&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Optics| first1=Michael|last1=Bass|first2=Casimer|last2=DeCusatis| first3=Jay|last3=Enoch|first4=Vasudevan|last4=Lakshminarayanan|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2009|isbn=978-0-07-149889-0|ref=harv|page=17.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.&lt;ref name=Ostdiek&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inquiry into Physics |first1=Vern J. |last1=Ostdiek|first2=Donald J.|last2=Bord|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=978-0-495-11943-2|ref=harv|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1851, he joined as a foreign member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00000342 |title=C.F. Gauss (1797–1855) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Gauss selected the topic for [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s inaugural lecture &quot;Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen&quot; (''About the hypotheses that underlie Geometry'').&lt;ref name=Monastyrsky&gt;{{Cite book|title=Riemann, Topology, and Physics|first=Michael|last=Monastyrsky|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1987|isbn=978-0-8176-3262-5|ref=harv|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bühler2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 1855, Gauss died of a heart attack in Göttingen (then [[Kingdom of Hanover]] and now [[Lower Saxony]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;wichita state&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; he is interred in the [[Albanifriedhof|Albani Cemetery]] there. Two people gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law [[Heinrich Ewald]], and [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]], who was Gauss's close friend and biographer. Gauss's brain was preserved and was studied by [[Rudolf Wagner]], who found its mass to be slightly above average, at 1,492&amp;nbsp;grams, and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters&lt;ref&gt;This reference from 1891 ({{cite journal

In the later reference: Dunnington (1927), the unit is erroneously reported as square cm, which gives an unreasonably large area; the 1891 reference is more reliable.&lt;/ref&gt; (340.362 square inches). Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century were suggested as the explanation of his genius.&lt;ref name=bardi&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bardi | first = Jason | title = The Fifth Postulate: How Unraveling A Two Thousand Year Old Mystery Unraveled the Universe | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 2008 | page = 189 | isbn = 978-0-470-46736-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious views ===
Gauss was a [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]], a member of the St. Albans Evangelical Lutheran church in Göttingen.{{sfn| Dunnington|2004|p=300}} Potential evidence that Gauss believed in God comes from his response after solving a problem that had previously defeated him: &quot;Finally, two days ago, I succeeded—not on account of my hard efforts, but by the grace of the Lord.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WikiQuotes|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|website=WikiQuotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his biographers, [[G. Waldo Dunnington]], described Gauss's religious views as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength, it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life, it brought him confidence. Gauss's God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report the truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|pp=298–301}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss's personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree about his religious stance, with Bühler and others considering him a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox views,&lt;ref name=Buhler3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard Falk 1995 121&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|url=https://archive.org/details/americanjudaismi00falk|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0016-3|author=Gerhard Falk|page=[https://archive.org/details/americanjudaismi00falk/page/121 121]|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not fully believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet. Evidently, Gauss was a Deist with a good deal of skepticism concerning religion but incorporating a great deal of philosophical interest in the Big Questions, that is. the immortality of the soul, the afterlife and the meaning of man's existence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bühler4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|page=152|quote=Closely related to Gauss's political and social views were his religious beliefs. Despite his religious beliefs. Despite his strong roots in the Enlightenment, Gauss was not an atheist, rather a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox convictions, unorthodox even if measured against the very liberal persuasions of the contemporary Protestant church.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Dunnington (though admitting that Gauss did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas and that it is unknown what he believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions) points out that he was, at least, a nominal [[Lutheran]].{{efn|{{harvnb| Dunnington|2004|p=305}} writes &quot;It is not known just what Gauss believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions. He did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas. Officially he was a member of St. Albans Church (Evangelical Lutheran) in Gottingen. All baptisms, burials, and weddings in his family occurred there. It is also not known whether he attended church regularly or contributed financially. A faculty colleague called Gauss a deist, but there is good reason to believe that this label did not fit well. Gauss possessed strong religious tolerance which he carried over to every belief originating in the depths of the human heart. This tolerance is not to be confused with religious indifference. He took a special interest in the religious development of the human race, especially in his own century. With reference to the manifold denominations, which frequently did not agree with his views, he always emphasized that one is not justified in disturbing the faith of others in which they find consolation for earthly sufferings and a safe refuge in days of misfortune&quot;}}

In connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Gauss, in which they discussed [[William Whewell]]'s book ''Of the Plurality of Worlds''. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he &quot;envied&quot; those who were able to easily believe.&lt;ref name=Buhler3&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{harvnb|Dunnington|2004|p=305}} quotes: &quot;league, I believe you are more believing in the Bible than I. I am not, and, he added, with the expression of great inner emotion, you are much happier than I. I must say that so often in earlier times when I saw people of the lower classes, simple manual laborers who could believe so rightly with their hearts, I always envied them, and now, he continued, with soft voice and that naive childlike manner peculiar to him, while a tear came to his eye, tell me how does one begin this?...&quot;}} This later led them to discuss the topic of [[faith]], and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister [[Paul Gerhardt]] than by [[Moses]].{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=356|ps=: &quot;I must confess that such old theologians and song writers as Paul Gerhard have always made a great impression on me; a song by Paul Gerhard always exerted a wonderful power on me, much more than, for example, Moses, against whom as a man of God I have all sorts of qualms.&quot;}} Other religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, [[Johann Peter Süssmilch]], and the [[New Testament]]. Two religious works which Gauss read frequently were Braubach's ''Seelenlehre'' (Giessen, 1843) and Siissmilch's ''Gottliche'' (Ordnung gerettet A756); he also devoted considerable time to the New Testament in the original Greek.{{sfn| Dunnington|2004|p=305}}

Dunnington further elaborates on Gauss's religious views by writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;Gauss's religious consciousness was based on an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods. He conceived spiritual life in the whole universe as a great system of law penetrated by eternal truth, and from this source he gained the firm confidence that death does not end all.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=300}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gauss declared he firmly believed in the [[afterlife]], and saw spirituality as something essentially important for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-503085-3|author=Morris Kline|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted stating: ''&quot;The world would be nonsense, the whole creation an absurdity without immortality,&quot;''{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=357}} and for this statement he was severely criticized by the atheist [[Karl Eugen Dühring|Eugen Dühring]] who judged him as a narrow superstitious man.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=359}}

Though he was not a church-goer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gauss, Carl Friedrich|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.aspx|publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=2008|quote=In seeming contradiction, his religious and philosophical views leaned toward those of his political opponents. He was an uncompromising believer in the priority of empiricism in science. He did not adhere to the views of Kant, Hegel and other idealist philosophers of the day. He was not a churchman and kept his religious views to himself. Moral rectitude and the advancement of scientific knowledge were his avowed principles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss strongly upheld [[religious tolerance]], believing &quot;that one is not justified in disturbing another's religious belief, in which they find consolation for earthly sorrows in time of trouble.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt; When his son Eugene announced that he wanted to become a Christian missionary, Gauss approved of this, saying that regardless of the problems within religious organizations, missionary work was &quot;a highly honorable&quot; task.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=311}}

He then married Minna Waldeck (1788–1831)&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; on 4 August 1810,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; and had three more children.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Gauss was never quite the same without his first wife, and he, just like his father, grew to dominate his children.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Minna Waldeck died on 12 September 1831.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Gauss had six children. With Johanna (1780–1809), his children were Joseph (1806–1873), Wilhelmina (1808–1846) and Louis (1809–1810). With Minna Waldeck he also had three children: Eugene (1811–1896), Wilhelm (1813–1879) and Therese (1816–1864). Eugene shared a good measure of Gauss's talent in languages and computation.&lt;ref name=&quot;gausschildren&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gausschildren.org/genwiki/index.php?title=Letter:GAUSS,_Charles_Henry_to_Florian_Cajori_-_1898-12-21 |title=Letter: Charles Henry Gauss to Florian Cajori – 21 December 1898 |publisher=Susan D.

His mother lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificmonthly&quot;/&gt;

Gauss eventually had conflicts with his sons. He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for &quot;fear of lowering the family name&quot;, as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;gausschildren&quot; /&gt; Gauss wanted Eugene to become a lawyer, but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States. While working for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, he learned the Sioux language. Later, he moved to [[Missouri]] and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837 and settled in Missouri, starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also [[s:Robert Gauss to Felix Klein - September 3, 1912|the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein]] on 3 September 1912.

=== Personality ===
Gauss was an ardent [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto ''pauca sed matura'' (&quot;few, but ripe&quot;). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them. Scottish-American mathematician and writer [[Eric Temple Bell]] said that if Gauss had published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in [[Berlin]] in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]].

On Gauss's recommendation, [[Friedrich Bessel]] was awarded an honorary doctor degree from Göttingen in March 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Bessel never had a university education.&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Koch, ''Introduction to Classical Mathematics I: From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law to the Uniformization Theorem'', Springer, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before she died, [[Sophie Germain]] was recommended by Gauss to receive an honorary degree; she never received it.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Nick (1990). &quot;Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?&quot;. ''The Mathematical Gazette'' '''74''' (470): 346–351, esp. p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs—he preferred them to appear &quot;out of thin air&quot; and erased all traces of how he discovered them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', where he states that all analysis (i.e., the paths one traveled to reach the solution of a problem) must be suppressed for sake of brevity.

Gauss supported the monarchy and opposed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], whom he saw as an outgrowth of revolution.

Gauss summarized his views on the pursuit of knowledge in a letter to [[Farkas Bolyai]] dated 2 September 1808 as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=416}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Career and achievements ==
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}

===Algebra===
[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's magnum opus, ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]
In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to the implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.

Gauss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol {{math|≡}} for [[Congruence relation|congruence]] and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], contained the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]]. It appears that Gauss already knew the [[class number formula]] in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did Gauss know Dirichlet's class number formula in 1801? |work=[[MathOverflow]] |date=10 October 2012 |url=https://mathoverflow.net/q/109330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems:
* [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]] for ''n'' = 3
* [[Fermat's last theorem]] for ''n'' = 5
* [[Descartes's rule of signs]]
* [[Kepler conjecture]] for regular arrangements

He also
* explained the [[pentagramma mirificum]] (see [https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~sek/cluster/pentagramma/ University of Bielefeld website])
* developed an algorithm for determining the [[Computus#Gauss algorithm|date of Easter]]
* invented the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]] for calculating the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s 160 years before Cooley and Tukey

===Astronomy===
[[File:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gauß, 1828.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Gauss published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' (1828)]]
In the same year, Italian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. Gauss heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December at [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

[[Gauss's method]] involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Second Law]]). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Development of mathematics in the 19th century|last1=Klein|first1=Felix|last2=Hermann|first2=Robert |isbn=978-0-915692-28-6|year=1979|publisher=Math Sci Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such method was the [[fast Fourier transform]]. While this method is attributed to a 1965 paper by [[J.W. Cooley]] and [[J.W. Tukey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooley |first=James W. |first2=John W. |last2=Tukey |title=An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series |journal=[[Mathematics of Computation|Math. Comput.]] |volume=19 |issue= 90|pages=297–301 |year=1965 |doi=10.2307/2003354 |jstor=2003354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method. His paper, ''Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gauss |first1=C.F. |date=1876| orig-year=n.d. | title= Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata | work=Carl Friedrich Gauss Werke| location=Göttingen |language=la|pages=265–327 |url=https://archive.org/stream/werkecarlf03gausrich#page/n277/mode/2up|publisher=Göttingen] K. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen }}&lt;/ref&gt; was only published posthumously in Volume 3 of his collected works. This paper predates the first presentation by [[Joseph Fourier]] on the subject in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heideman|first=M.|author2=Johnson, D.|author3=Burrus, C.|title=Gauss and the history of the fast fourier transform|journal=IEEE ASSP Magazine|year=1984|volume=1|issue=4|pages=14–21|doi=10.1109/MASSP.1984.1162257|url=http://www.cis.rit.edu/class/simg716/Gauss_History_FFT.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach noted that &quot;without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again&quot;. Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[Göttingen Observatory|observatory in Göttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life.

[[File:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|Four [[normal distribution]]s]]
The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein, Vorlesungen über die Entwicklung der Mathematik im 19. Jahrhundert. Berlin: Julius Springer Verlag, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]], and contained an influential treatment of the [[Least squares|method of least squares]], a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of [[Observational error|measurement error]].

Gauss proved the method under the assumption of [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] errors (see [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]; see also [[List of topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gaussian]]). The method had been described earlier by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the &quot;priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Stigler, &quot;Gauss and the Invention of Least Squares,&quot; ''Ann. Statist.'', '''9'''(3), 1981, pp. 465–474.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic survey ===
[[File:Gauß-Stein Garlste.jpg|thumb|[[Surveying|Geodetic survey]] stone in Garlste (now Garlstedt)]]
In 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a [[surveying|geodetic survey]] of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], linking up with previous Danish surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the [[heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.

===Non-Euclidean geometries===
Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.

Research on these geometries led to, among other things, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend [[Farkas Bolyai|Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai]] with whom Gauss had sworn &quot;brotherhood and the banner of truth&quot; as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.

Bolyai's son, [[János Bolyai]], discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: &quot;To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work&amp;nbsp;... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.&quot;

This unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was &quot;stealing&quot; his idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krantz2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven G. Krantz|title=An Episodic History of Mathematics: Mathematical Culture through Problem Solving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulmAH-6IzNoC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=1 April 2010|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-766-3|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. [[G. Waldo Dunnington|Waldo Dunnington]], a biographer of Gauss, argues in ''Gauss, Titan of Science'' that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidean geometry long before it was published by Bolyai, but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halsted|first1=G.B.|title=Duncan M.Y.

===Theorema Egregium===
The geodetic survey of Hanover, which required Gauss to spend summers traveling on horseback for a decade,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keplersdiscovery.com/Gauss.html The Prince of Mathematics]. The Door to Science by keplersdiscovery.com.&lt;/ref&gt; fueled Gauss's interest in [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]], fields of mathematics dealing with [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]]. Among other things, he came up with the notion of [[Gaussian curvature]].
This led in 1828 to an important theorem, the [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem''), establishing an important property of the notion of [[curvature]]. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring [[angle]]s and [[distance]]s on the surface.

That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be [[embedding|embedded]] in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.

In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Gauss was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter G|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterG.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetism===
In 1831, Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], leading to new knowledge in [[magnetism]] (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time) and the discovery of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] in electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/181 181]|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/181}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that he formulated his namesake [[Gauss's law|law]]. They constructed the first [[Electrical telegraph|electromechanical telegraph]] in 1833,&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic [[observatory]] to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the &quot;Magnetischer Verein&quot; (''magnetic association''), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer ([[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]]) sources of Earth's magnetic field.

==Appraisal==
The British mathematician [[Henry John Stephen Smith]] (1826–1883) gave the following appraisal of Gauss:
{{block quote|If we except the great name of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] it is probable that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute rigorousness in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied. It may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty. Gauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss's claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost rigorousness in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;H.J.S Smith,''Presidential Address'', Proceedings of the London Math. Soc. VIII, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Anecdotes ==
There are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.

Another story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task: add a list of [[integer]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant [[Johann Christian Martin Bartels|Martin Bartels]].

Gauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;101, 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;99&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;101, 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;98&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;101, and so on, for a [[Triangular number|total sum]] of 50&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;101&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5050.
However, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see&lt;ref name=&quot;hayesreckoning&quot; /&gt; for discussion of the original [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book ''A first course in Abstract Algebra'', question whether it ever happened.

He referred to mathematics as &quot;the queen of sciences&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Waltershausen, Wolfgang Sartorius von (1856, repr. 1965). Gauss zum Gedächtniss. Sändig Reprint Verlag H. R. Wohlwend. {{ISBN|3-253-01702-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding [[Euler's identity]] as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician.&lt;ref name=First-Class&gt;{{cite book|last=Derbyshire|first=John|title=Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location= Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-309-08549-6|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsoqLNQUIJMC&amp;q=first-class+mathematician#v=snippet&amp;q=first-class%20mathematician&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorations ==
{{Main|List of things named after Carl Friedrich Gauss}}
[[File:10 DM Serie4 Vorderseite.jpg|thumb|German 10-[[Deutsche Mark]] [[Banknote]] (1993; discontinued) featuring Gauss]]
From 1989 through 2001, Gauss's portrait, a [[normal distribution curve]] and some prominent [[Göttingen]] buildings were featured on the German ten-mark banknote.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The reverse featured the approach for [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. Germany has also issued three postage stamps honoring Gauss. One (no. 725) appeared in 1955 on the hundredth anniversary of his death; two others, nos. 1246 and 1811, in 1977, the 200th anniversary of his birth.

[[Daniel Kehlmann]]'s 2005 novel ''Die Vermessung der Welt'', translated into English as ''[[Measuring the World]]'' (2006), explores Gauss's life and work through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting them with those of the German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. A film version directed by [[Detlev Buck]] was released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571401/|title=Die Vermessung der Welt (2012) – Internet Movie Database|author=baharuka|date=25 October 2012|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Gauss was placed in the [[Walhalla temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/downloads/aviso/2004_1_aviso_48-49.pdf |title=Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst: Startseite |publisher=Stmwfk.bayern.de |accessdate=19 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325153748/http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/downloads/aviso/2004_1_aviso_48-49.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of things named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|numerous things named in honor of Gauss]] include:
* The [[normal distribution]], also known as the Gaussian distribution, the most common bell curve in statistics
* The [[Gauss Prize]], one of the highest honors in mathematics
* [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS unit]] for [[magnetic field]]

In 1929 the Polish mathematician [[Marian Rejewski]], who helped to solve the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]] in December 1932, began studying [[actuarial statistics]] at [[Göttingen]]. At the request of his [[Poznań University]] professor, [[Zdzisław Krygowski]], on arriving at Göttingen Rejewski laid flowers on Gauss's grave.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Kozaczuk]], ''Enigma:  How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two'', Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, p. 7, note 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2018, [[Google]] honoured Gauss in his would-be 241st birthday with a [[Google Doodle]] showcased in Europe, Russia, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, parts of Southern and Central America and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/johann-carl-friedrich-gaus-241st-birthday|title=Johann Carl Friedrich Gauß's 241st Birthday|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Friedrich Gauss, who also introduced the so-called [[Gaussian logarithm]]s, sometimes gets confused with {{interlanguage link|Friedrich Gustav Gauss|de|Friedrich Gustav Gauß}} (1829–1915), a German geologist, who also published some well-known [[logarithm table]]s used up into the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kühn_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=C.F.
