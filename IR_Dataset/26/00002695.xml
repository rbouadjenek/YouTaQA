{{History of Afghanistan}}
'''Abdur Rahman Khan''' ({{lang-ps| عبدالرحمان خان}}) (between 1840 and 1844{{snd}}October 1, 1901) was [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]] from 1880 to 1901.&lt;ref&gt;However, his year of birth is given as 1830 in [[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for uniting the country after years of internal fighting and negotiation of the [[Durand Line]] Agreement with [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thediplomat&quot; /&gt;

Abdur Rahman Khan was the first child and only son of [[Mohammad Afzal Khan]], and grandson of [[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Dost Mohammad Khan]]. Abdur Rahman Khan re-established the writ of the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] after the disarray that followed the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|second Anglo-Afghan war]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

He became known as ''The Iron Amir'' because his government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of [[espionage]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}} and for his [[1888-1893 Uprisings of Hazaras|crushing of a number of rebellions]] by various tribes who were led by his relatives.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/871/Abd-al-Rahman-Khan |title = ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Khān |publisher = |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and early career==
Before his death in [[Herat]], on June 9, 1863, Abdur Rahman's grandfather, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]], nominated his third son, [[Sher Ali Khan]], as his successor, passing over the two elder brothers, [[Mohammad Afzal Khan|Afzal Khan]] and [[Mohammad Azam Khan|Azam Khan]]. At first, the new Amir was quietly recognized. But after a few months, Afzal Khan raised an [[insurrection]] in the north of the country, where he had been governing when his father died.  This began a fierce internecine conflict for power between Dost Mohammad's sons, which lasted for nearly five years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}} The [[Musahiban]] are descendants of [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s older brother, [[Sultan Mohammad Khan]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Described by the American scholar and explorer [[Eugene Schuyler]] as &quot;a tall well-built man, with a large head, and a marked Afghan, almost [[Jewish people|Jewish]], face&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Schuyler, ''Turkistan : notes of a journey in Russian Turkistan, Kokand, Bukhara and Kuldja'', F.A. Praeger (1966), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Abdur Rahman distinguished himself for his ability and energetic daring. Although his father, Afzal Khan came to terms with the Amir Sher Ali, Abdur's behaviour in the northern province soon excited the Amir's suspicion and, when he was summoned to Kabul, fled across the [[Oxus]] into [[Bukhara]]. Sher Ali threw Afzal Khan into prison, and a revolt followed in southern Afghanistan.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}

The Amir had scarcely suppressed it by winning a desperate battle when Abdur Rahman's reappearance in the north was a signal for a mutiny by troops stationed in those parts and a gathering of armed bands to his standard. After some delay and desultory fighting, he and his uncle, Azam Khan, occupied Kabul in March 1866.  The Amir Sher Ali marched up against them from [[Kandahar]]; but in the battle that ensued at Sheikhabad on May 10, he was deserted by a large body of his troops, and after his signal defeat Abdur Rahman released his father, Afzal Khan, from prison in [[Ghazni]], and installed him upon the throne as Amir of Afghanistan.  Notwithstanding the new Amir's incapacity, and some jealousy between the real leaders, Abdur Rahman and his uncle, they again routed Sher Ali's forces, and occupied Kandahar in 1867. When Afzal Khan died at the end of the year, Azam Khan became the new ruler, with Abdur Rahman installed as governor in the northern province. But towards the end of 1868, Sher Ali's return and a general rising in his favour resulted in Abdur Rahman and Azam Khan's defeat at ''Tinah Khan'' on January 3, 1869. Both sought refuge to the east in Central Asia, where Abdur Rahman placed himself under Russian protection at [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|authorlink=|editor-first=|editor-last=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title='Abdor Rahman Khan|edition=15th|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak – Bayes|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/20 20]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azam died in Kabul in October 1869.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}

==Exile and negotiated return to power==
[[File:Indian Celebrities- Amir Abd al-Raḥmān WDL11441.png|thumb|Abd al-Raḥmān Khān during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]]. Khān was renowned for his skill and forcefulness in suppressing rebellions against his authority. He is credited with creating a centralized state in the aftermath the war, based on a cabinet called the Supreme Council, a general assembly called the [[Loya Jirgah]], and the army. His achievements included the introduction of some modern manufacturing, agriculture, and health care.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This portrait shows him as a young man in uniform, clutching the hilt of his sword]]

Abdur Rahman lived in exile in [[Tashkent]]. He was being told to cross the [[Oxus]] and claim [[throne]] for [[Amir]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In March 1880, a report reached India that Abdur Rahman was in northern Afghanistan; and the Governor-General, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], opened communications with him to the effect that the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] were prepared to withdraw their troops, and to recognize Abdur Rahman as Amir of Afghanistan, with the exception of Kandahar and some districts adjacent to it.  After some negotiations, and an interview with [[Lepel Griffin]], the diplomatic representative at Kabul of the Indian government.  Griffin described Abdur Rahman as a man of middle height, with an exceedingly intelligent face and frank and courteous manners, shrewd and able in conversation on the business in hand.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}

==Reign==

At the ''[[Durbar (court)|durbar]]'' on July 22, 1880, Abdur Rahman was officially recognized as Amir, granted assistance in arms and money, and promised, in case of unprovoked foreign aggression, such further aid as might be necessary to repel it, provided that he align his foreign policy with the British. The British evacuation of Afghanistan was settled on the terms proposed, and in 1881, the [[British Army|British troops]] also handed over Kandahar to the new ''Amir''.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}

However, [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]], one of Sher Ali Khan's sons, marched upon that city from Herat, defeated Abdur Rahman's troops, and occupied the place in July 1880. This serious reverse roused the ''Amir'', who had not displayed much activity. Instead, Ayub Khan was defeated in Kandahar by the British General Frederick Roberts on 1 September 1880. Ayub Khan was forced to flee into Persia. From that time Abdur Rahman was fairly seated firm on the throne at Kabul, thanks to the unwavering British protections in terms of giving large supplies of arms and money. In the course of the next few years, Abdul Rahman consolidated his grip over all Afghanistan, suppressing [[insurrection]] by a relentless and brutal use of his [[Despotism|despotic]] authority. The powerful [[Ghilzai]] revolted against the severity of his measures several times. In that same year, Ayub Khan made a fruitless inroad from Persia.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In 1885, at the moment when the ''Amir'' was in conference with the British [[viceroy]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], in India, the news came of a skirmish between Russian and Afghan troops at [[Panjdeh]], over a disputed point in the demarcation of the northwestern frontier of Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman's attitude at this critical juncture is a good example of his political sagacity. To one who had been a man of war from his youth, who had won and lost many fights, the rout of a detachment and the forcible seizure of some debatable frontier lands was an untoward incident; but it was not a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] for calling upon the British, although they had guaranteed his territory's integrity, to vindicate his rights by hostilities which would certainly bring upon him a Russian invasion from the north, and would compel his British allies to throw an army into Afghanistan from the southeast.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pages=37–38}} He also published his [[autobiography]] in 1885, which served more as an advice guide for [[prince]]s than anything else.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11308/ |title= Worthy Advice in the Affairs of the World and Religion: The Autobiography of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan |website= [[World Digital Library]] |year= 1885 |accessdate = 2013-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest lay in keeping powerful neighbours, whether friends or foes, outside his kingdom. He knew this to be the only policy that would be supported by the Afghan nation; and although for some time a rupture with Russia seemed imminent, while the [[India Office|Government of India]] made ready for that contingency, the Amir's reserved and circumspect tone in the consultations with him helped to turn the balance between peace and war, and substantially conduced towards a pacific solution. Abdur Rahman left on those who met him in India the impression of a clear-headed man of action, with great self-reliance and hardihood, not without indications of the implacable severity that too often marked his administration. His investment with the insignia of the highest grade of the [[Order of the Star of India]] appeared to give him much pleasure.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}

His adventurous life, his forcible character, the position of his state as a barrier between the Indian and the Russian empires, and the skill with which he held the balance in dealing with them, combined to make him a prominent figure in contemporary Asian politics and will mark his reign as an epoch in the history of Afghanistan. The Amir received an annual [[subsidy]] from the British government of 1,850,000 [[rupee]]s. He was allowed to import munitions of war.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}} He succeeded in imposing an organized government upon the fiercest and most unruly population in [[Asia]]; he availed himself of [[Europe]]an inventions for strengthening his armament, while he sternly set his face against all innovations which, like [[railway]]s and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]s, might give Europeans a foothold within his country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}

In 1893 he built himself a summer house called the [[Bagh-e Bala Palace]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The Amir found himself unable, by reason of [[Illness|ill-health]], to accept an invitation from [[Queen Victoria]] to visit England; but his second son [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]] went instead.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}

==Durand Line==
{{See also|Durand Line}}

In 1893, Mortimer Durand was deputed to Kabul by the government of British India for this purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions, and in order to discuss with  Amir Abdur Rahman Khan other pending questions. Abdur Rahman Khan showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In the agreement that followed relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India. A Royal Commission was set up to determine the boundary between Afghanistan and British Governed India was tasked to negotiate terms for agreeing to the [[Durand Line]], between the two parties camped at [[Parachinar]], now part of FATA Pakistan, which is near [[Khost]], Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]], [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] Khyber. Afghanistan was represented by [[Sahibzada Abdul Latif]] and the Governor [[Sardar Shireendil Khan]] representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] negotiated with Abdur Rahman Khan the ''Durand Line Treaty'' for the demarcation of the frontier between Afghanistan, the [[FATA]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan]] Provinces of Pakistan the successor state of [[British India]]. In 1905, Amir [[Habibullah Khan]] signed a new agreement with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] which confirmed the legality of Durand Line.&lt;ref name=&quot;thediplomat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/02/why-the-durand-line-matters/|title=Why the Durand Line matters|date=21 February 2014|work=The Diplomat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227044723/https://thediplomat.com/2014/02/why-the-durand-line-matters/|archive-date=27 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the legality durand line was once again confirmed by King [[Amanullah Khan]] through the treaty of Rawalpindi in 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;thediplomat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/why-afghanistan-s-independence-day-remains-problematic-29388|title=Why Afghanistan's independence day remains problematic|date=29 August 2019|work=TRT world|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901170326/https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/why-afghanistan-s-independence-day-remains-problematic-29388|archive-date=1 September 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durand Line was once again recognised as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan by [[Daoud Khan|Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (former prime minister and later president of Afghanistan) during his visit to Pakistan in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rasanayagam|first=Angelo|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|page=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/64 64]|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

==Dictatorship and the &quot;Iron Amir&quot;==
Abdur Rahman Khan's government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army; it was administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of [[espionage]]; while the exercise of his personal authority was too often stained by acts of unnecessary cruelty.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}} He held open courts for the receipt of petitioners and the dispensation of justice; and in the disposal of business he was indefatigable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

[[File:Abdur Rahman Khan sitting.jpg|thumb|Abdur Rahman Khan in 1897 with family members]]
In the 1880s, the &quot;Iron Emir&quot; decided to strategically displace some members of different ethnic groups in order to bring better security. For example, he &quot;uprooted troublesome Durrani and Ghilzai [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribes and [[Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan|transported them]] to [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Tajiks|Tajik]] populated areas in the north, where they could spy on local Dari-speaking, non-Pashtun ethnic groups and act as a screen against further Russian encroachments on Afghan territory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wars of Afghanistan: Messianic Terrorism, Tribal Conflicts, and the Failures of Great Powers |last1=Tomsen |first1=Peter |authorlink=|volume=|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs |location=|isbn=1-5864-8781-7|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of 1888, the Amir spent eighteen months in his northern provinces bordering upon the Oxus, where he was engaged in pacifying the country that had been disturbed by revolts, and in punishing with a heavy hand all who were known or suspected to have taken any part in rebellion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}

In 1895–1896, Abdur Rahman directed the invasion of [[Kafiristan]] and the conversion of its indigenous peoples to Islam. The region was subsequently renamed [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]].  In 1896, he adopted the title of ''Zia-ul-Millat-Wa-ud Din'' (&quot;Light of the nation and religion&quot;), and his zeal for the cause of [[Islam]] induced him to publish [[treatises]] on ''[[jihad]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}

Chitral, Yarkand and Ferghana became shelters for refugees in 1887 and 1883 from Badakhshan who fled from the campaigns of Abdul Rahman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergne2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Bergne|title=The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3coojMwTKU8C&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=15 June 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-283-7|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1888-1893 Uprisings of Hazaras===
{{Main|1888-1893 Uprisings of Hazaras}}
In the early 1890s some Hazara tribes revolted against Abdur Rahman. In 1888, the Amir's cousin, Ishak Khan, rebelled against him in the north; and also the Ghilzais (Hotakis, Tokhis and Andaris) revolted against him in 1887; but these enterprises came to nothing. As the Kabul Newsletters written by the British agents indicate, Abdul Rahman was an extremely ruthless man. He has been called 'The Dracula Amir' by some writers{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=37}}&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; According to [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], &quot;thousands of Hazara men, women, and children were sold as slaves in the markets of Kabul and [[Kandahar|Qandahar]], while numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-2|title=HAZĀRA ii. HISTORY|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period some Hazaras migrated to [[Quetta]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], while smaller number moved to [[Mashhad]] in northeastern Iran. The crackdown resulted in [[mass killing]], enslavement and displacement of the [[Hazaras]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Death and Descendants==
[[File:Amir Abdurahman Khan's Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Site of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan's tomb, located in [[Kabul]].]]
Abdur Rahman died on October 1, 1901 inside his summer palace, being succeeded by his son [[Habibullah Khan]]. He had defeated all enterprises by rivals against his throne; he had broken down the power of local chiefs, and tamed the refractory tribes; so that his orders were irresistible throughout the whole dominion.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Today, his descendants can be found in many places outside Afghanistan, such as in America, [[France]], [[Germany]], and even in Scandinavian countries such as [[Denmark]]. His two eldest sons, Habibullah Khan and [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]], were born at [[Samarkand]]. His youngest son, Mahomed Omar Jan, was born in 1889 of an Afghan mother, connected by descent with the [[Barakzai]] family.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=38}}

==Legacy==
Afghan society has mixed feelings about his rule. Some remember him as a ruler who initiated many programs for modernization and effectively prevented the country from being occupied by Russia and Britain during [[the Great Game]]. On the other hand, some sectors of Afghanistan remember him as a domestically violent and geopolitically weak ruler in that he was brought to power by the British and declared war on Afghan minorities instead of fighting the British who were deciding Afghanistan's foreign policy for him.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;
