{{For|the Christian martyr|Aedesius of Alexandria}}
'''Aedesius''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Αἰδέσιος}}, died 355 AD) was a [[Neo-Platonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher and mystic born of a noble [[Cappadocia]]n family.

==Career==
Aedesius was born into a wealthy Cappadocian family, but he moved to [[Syria]], where he was apprenticed to [[Iamblichos]]. He quickly became his best pupil and the two became friends. Aedesius's own philosophical doctrine, however, was somewhere between [[Platonism]] and [[eclecticism]] and, according to [[Eunapius]], he differed from Iamblichus on certain points connected with [[theurgy]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aedesius|volume=1|page=244}} This cites: [[Heinrich Ritter|Ritter]] and [[Ludwig Preller|Preller]], p.&amp;nbsp;552 (presumably of ''Historia philosophiae Graeco-Romanae''); Ritter's ''Geschichte der Philosophie''; [[Thomas Whittaker (metaphysician)|T. Whittaker]], ''The Neoplatonists'' (Cambridge, 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his master, the school of Syria was dispersed and Aedesius seems to have modified his doctrines out of fear of [[Constantine II of the Roman Empire|Constantine II]], and took refuge in [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Jowett  | first = Benjamin  | author-link = Benjamin Jowett  | contribution = Aedesius  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 23  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0032.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; An oracle in [[hexameter]] verse represented a pastoral life as his only retreat, but his disciples, perhaps calming his fears by a metaphorical interpretation, compelled him to resume his instructions.

== School of philosophy at Pergamon ==
Aedesius founded a school of philosophy at [[Pergamon]], which emphasized theurgy and the revival of [[polytheism]], and where he numbered among his pupils [[Eusebius of Myndus]], [[Maximus of Ephesus]], and the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. After the accession of the latter to the imperial purple he invited Aedesius to continue his instructions, but the declining strength of the sage being unequal to the task, two of his most learned disciples, [[Chrysanthius]] and the aforementioned Eusebius, were by his own desire appointed to supply his place.&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius, ''Vita Aedesius''&lt;/ref&gt;

None of his writings have survived, but there is an extant biography by [[Eunapius]], a Greek sophist and historian of the 4th century who wrote a collection of biographies titled ''Lives of the Sophists''.
