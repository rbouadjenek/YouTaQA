In [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], an '''''aedicula''''' (plural '''''aediculae''''') is a small [[shrine]]. The word ''aedicula'' is the [[diminutive]] of the [[Latin]] ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', a temple building, and can translate into English as &quot;aedicule&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/aedicule &quot;Aedicule&quot; or &quot;edicule&quot;] at the ''Oxford Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;edicule&quot;. 

Many aediculae were household [[shrine]]s that held small [[altar]]s or [[statue]]s of the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aedicula|volume=1|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lares were [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] protecting the house and the family household gods. The Penates were originally [[patron gods]] (really [[genius (mythology)|genii]]) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house.

Other aediculae were small shrines within larger [[temple]]s, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns. In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society. They are installed in public buildings like the [[Triumphal arch]], [[City gate]], or [[Therm]]es. The [[Celsus]] Library in [[Ephesus]] (2. c. AD) is a good example. From the 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire onwards such shrines, or the framework enclosing them, are often called by the Biblical term [[tabernacle]], which becomes extended to any elaborated framework for a niche, window or picture.

==Gothic aediculae==
As in [[Classical architecture]], in [[Gothic architecture]], too, an aedicule or  tabernacle frame is a structural framing device that gives importance to its contents, whether an inscribed plaque, a [[cult object]], a bust or the like, by assuming the tectonic vocabulary of a little building that sets it apart from the wall against which it is placed. A tabernacle frame on a wall serves similar hieratic functions as a free-standing, three-dimensional architectural [[baldaquin]] or a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over an [[altar]].

In Late Gothic settings, [[altarpiece]]s and [[devotional image]]s were customarily crowned with [[gable]]s and canopies supported by clustered-column piers, echoing in small the architecture of Gothic churches.  Painted ædicules frame figures from sacred history in initial letters of [[illuminated manuscript]]s.

==Renaissance aediculae==
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi finestre inginocchiate.JPG|thumb|Two &quot;tabernacle windows&quot; in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence.  These are of the type known as &quot;inginocchiata&quot;, &quot;kneeling&quot; on two brackets.]] 
Classicizing architectonic structure and decor ''all'antica'', in the &quot;ancient [Roman] mode&quot;, became a fashionable way to frame a painted or bas-relief portrait, or protect an expensive and precious mirror&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fram/ho_1975.1.1638.htm Metropolitan Museum: tabernacle frame, Florence, ca 1510]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[High Renaissance]]; Italian precedents were imitated in France, then in Spain, England and Germany during the later 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tabernacleinfo.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art: Tabernacle frames from the Samuel H. Kress collection |access-date=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006235453/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tabernacleinfo.shtm |archive-date=2009-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Renaissance classicism==
Aedicular door surrounds that are architecturally treated, with pilasters or columns flanking the doorway and an [[entablature]] even with a [[pediment]] over it came into use with the 16th century.  In the [[neo-Palladian]] revival in Britain, architectonic aedicular or tabernacle frames, carved and gilded, are favourite schemes for English [[Palladian]] mirror frames of the late 1720s through the 1740s, by such designers as [[William Kent]].

==Other aedicula==
Similar small shrines, called ''[[naiskos|naiskoi]]'', are found in [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], but their use was strictly religious.

Aediculae exist today in Roman [[cemeteries]] as a part of funeral architecture.

Presently the most famous aedicule is situated inside the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in city of [[Jerusalem]].

Contemporary American architect [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]] uses the concept of aediculae in his work to create spaces within spaces and to evoke the spiritual significance of the home.
