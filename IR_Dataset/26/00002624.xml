{{History of Greece}}
'''Aegean civilization''' is a general term for the [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] [[civilization]]s of [[Greece]] around the [[Aegean Sea]]. There are three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: [[Crete]], the [[Cyclades]] and the Greek mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aegean-civilization|title=Aegean civilizations|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=February 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crete is associated with the [[Minoan civilization]] from the Early Bronze Age. The Cyclades converge with the mainland during the [[Early Helladic]] (&quot;[[Minyans|Minyan]]&quot;) period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period. From ca. 1450 BC (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek [[Mycenaean civilization]] spreads to Crete.

The earlier Aegean farming populations brought agriculture to Western Europe already before 5,000 years BC.

== Aegean Neolithic farmers ==
{{See also|Neolithic Europe|Chalcolithic Europe}}

Recent DNA studies indicate that agriculture was brought to Western Europe by the Aegean populations, that are known as ‘the Aegean Neolithic farmers’. These Neolithic groups arrived to northern France and Germany already around 5,000 years BC. About 1,000 years later, they arrived in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com&quot;&gt;Paul Rincon, [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47938188 Stonehenge: DNA reveals origin of builders.] BBC News website, 16 April 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BraceDiekmann2019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brace|first1=Selina|last2=Diekmann|first2=Yoan|last3=Booth|first3=Thomas J. |display-authors=etal |title=Ancient genomes indicate population replacement in Early Neolithic Britain|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=3|issue=5|year=2019|pages=765–771|issn=2397-334X|doi=10.1038/s41559-019-0871-9|pmid=30988490|pmc=6520225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they left the Aegean, these populations quickly split into two groups with somewhat different cultures. One group went north along the Danube, while the other took a southerly route along the Mediterranean and reached Iberia. This latter group then arrived in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Davis (April 2019), [https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2019/april/neolithic-britain-where-did-the-first-farmers-come-from.html Neolithic Britain: where did the first farmers come from?] The Natural History Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that, these territories were populated by the hunter-gathererer cultures known as the [[Western Hunter-Gatherer|'western hunter-gatherers']], similar to the [[Cheddar Man]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com&quot;/&gt;

Most of the ancestry of the British population after 4,000 years BC (74% on average) is attributable to the Aegean Neolithic farmers. This indicates a substantial shift in ancestry with the transition to farming.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraceDiekmann2019&quot; /&gt;

Chalcolithic (copper) age in Europe started from about 3500 BC. This was also a period of [[Megalith]]ic culture.

==Commerce==
Commerce was practiced to some extent in very early times, as is proved by the distribution of [[Melos|Melian]] [[obsidian]] over all the Aegean area. We find Cretan vessels exported to [[Melos]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland. Melian vases came in their turn to Crete. After 1600 BC there is very close commerce with Egypt, and Aegean things find their way to all coasts of the Mediterranean. No traces of [[currency]] have come to light, unless certain axeheads, too slight for practical use, had that character. Standard weights have been found, as well as representations of ingots. The Aegean written documents have not yet proved (by being found outside the area) to be [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] (letter writing) correspondence with other countries. Representations of ships are not common, but several have been observed on Aegean gems, gem-sealings, [[frying pans]] and vases. They are vessels of low free-board, with [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and [[oar]]s. Familiarity with the sea is proved by the free use of marine motifs in decoration.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=247}} The most detailed illustrations are to be found on the 'ship fresco' at [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri]] on the island of Thera (Santorini) preserved by the ash fall from the volcanic eruption which destroyed the town there.

Discoveries, later in the 20th century, of sunken trading vessels such as those at [[Uluburun]] and [[Cape Gelidonya]] off the south coast of Turkey have brought forth an enormous amount of new information about that culture.

==Evidence==
For details of monumental evidence the articles on [[Crete]], [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]], [[Troad]], [[Cyprus]], etc., must be consulted. The most representative site explored up to now is [[Knossos]] (see [[Crete]]) which has yielded not only the most various but the most continuous evidence from the [[Neolithic age]] to the twilight of classical civilization. Next in importance come [[Hissarlik]], Mycenae, [[Phaestus]], [[Hagia Triada]], Tiryns, Phylakope, [[Palaikastro]] and [[Gournia]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

===Internal evidence===
*'''Structures''': [[Ruin]]s of [[palace]]s, palatial [[villa]]s, houses, built dome- or cist-[[Tholos tomb|graves]] and [[fortification]]s (Aegean islands, [[Greece|Greek]] mainland and northwestern [[Anatolia]]), but not distinct [[temple (Greek)|temples]]; small [[shrine]]s, however, and temene (religious enclosures, remains of one of which were probably found at Petsofa near Palaikastro by J. L. Myres in 1904) are represented on [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]s and [[fresco]]es. From the sources and from inlay-work we have also representations of palaces and houses.
*'''Structural decoration''': Architectural features, such as [[column]]s, [[frieze]]s and various [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]]; [[mural]] decoration, such as fresco-paintings, coloured [[relief]]s and [[mosaic]] inlay. Roof tiles were also occasionally employed, as at early Helladic [[Lerna]] and Akovitika,&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph W. Shaw 72&quot;&gt;Joseph W. Shaw, The Early Helladic II Corridor House: Development and Form, ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 91, No. 1. (Jan. 1987), pp. 59–79 (72).&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the [[Mycenae]]an towns of [[Gla]] and [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ione Mylonas Shear, “Excavations on the Acropolis of Midea: Results of the Greek-Swedish Excavations under the Direction of Katie Demakopoulou and Paul åström”, ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 104, No. 1. (Jan. 2000), pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Furniture]]''': (a) Domestic furniture, such as [[Packaging|vessel]]s of all sorts and in many materials, from huge store jars down to tiny [[unguent]] pots; culinary and other implements; [[throne]]s, [[chair|seats]], [[Table (furniture)|tables]], etc., these all in stone or plastered [[terracotta]]. (b) Sacred furniture, such as models or actual examples of [[ritual]] objects; of these we have also numerous pictorial representations. (c) [[Funeral|Funerary]] furniture, for example, [[coffin]]s in painted terracotta.
*'''Art products''': for example, plastic objects, carved in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[ivory]], cast or beaten in metals ([[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]]), or modelled in [[clay]], [[faience]], [[Wheatpaste|paste]], etc. Very little trace has yet been found of large free-standing [[sculpture]], but many examples exist of sculptors' smaller work. [[Vase]]s of all kinds, carved in [[marble]] or other stones, cast or beaten in metals or fashioned in clay, the latter in enormous number and variety, richly ornamented with coloured schemes, and sometimes bearing moulded decoration. Examples of painting on stone, opaque and transparent. Engraved objects in great number for example, ring-bezels and [[engraved gem|gem]]s; and an immense quantity of clay impressions, taken from these.
*'''[[Weapon]]s, [[tool]]s and implements''': In [[stone]], [[clay]] and [[bronze]], and at the last [[iron]], sometimes richly ornamented or inlaid. Numerous representations also of the same. No actual body [[armour]], except such as was ceremonial and buried with the dead, like the gold breastplates in the circle-graves at Mycenae or the full length body [[Dendra armour|armour]] from [[Dendra]].
*'''Articles of personal use''': for example, [[brooch]]es (fibulae), [[pin]]s, [[razor]]s, [[tweezers]], etc., often found as dedications to a deity, for example, in the [[Crete|Dictaean Cavern of Crete]]. No [[textile]]s have survived other than impressions in clay.
*'''Written documents''': for example, clay tablets and discs (so far in Crete only), but nothing of more perishable nature, such as skin, [[papyrus]], etc.; engraved gems and gem impressions; [[legend]]s written with [[pigment]] on [[pottery]] (rare); characters incised on stone or pottery. These show a number of systems of script employing either [[ideogram]]s or syllabograms (see [[Linear B]]).
*'''Excavated [[tomb]]s''': Of either the pit, [[Mycenaean chamber tomb|chamber]] or the [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] kind, in which the dead were laid, together with various objects of use and luxury, without [[cremation]], and in either coffins or loculi or simple wrappings.
*'''Public works''': Such as paved and stepped roadways, bridges, systems of drainage, etc.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

===External evidence===
*'''Monuments and records of other contemporary civilizations''': for example, representations of alien peoples in Egyptian frescoes; imitation of Aegean fabrics and style in non-Aegean lands; allusions to Mediterranean peoples in [[Egypt]]ian, [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] or [[Babylonia]]n records.
*'''Literary traditions of subsequent civilizations''': Especially the Hellenic; such as, for example, those embodied in the [[Homer]]ic poems, the legends concerning Crete, Mycenae, etc.; statements as to the origin of [[deity|gods]], cults and so forth, transmitted to us by Hellenic antiquarians such as [[Strabo]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], etc.
*'''Traces of [[Convention (norm)|customs]], [[creed]]s, [[ritual]]s, etc.''': In the Aegean area at a later time, discordant with the civilization in which they were practiced and indicating survival from earlier systems. There are also possible [[linguistics|linguistic]] and even physical survivals to be considered.
[[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] are the two principal sites on which evidence of a prehistoric civilization was remarked long ago by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

==Discovery==
The curtain-wall and towers of the Mycenaean [[citadel]], its [[Lion Gate|gate with heraldic lions]], and the great &quot;[[Treasury of Atreus]]&quot; had borne silent witness for ages before [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s time; but they were supposed only to speak to the [[Homer]]ic, or, at farthest, a rude Heroic beginning of purely [[History of Greece|Hellenic]] civilization. It was not until Schliemann exposed the contents of the graves which lay just inside the gate, that scholars recognized the advanced stage of [[art]] which prehistoric dwellers in the Mycenaean citadel had attained.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

There had been, however, a good deal of other evidence available before 1876, which, had it been collated and seriously studied, might have discounted the sensation that the discovery of the citadel graves eventually made. Although it was recognized that certain tributaries, represented for example, in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb of Rekhmara at [[Egypt]]ian [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as bearing vases of peculiar forms, were of some [[Mediterranean]] race, neither their precise habitat nor the degree of their civilization could be determined while so few actual prehistoric remains were known in the [[Mediterranean]] lands. Nor did the Aegean objects which were lying obscurely in museums in 1870, or thereabouts, provide a sufficient test of the real basis underlying the Hellenic myths of the [[Argos|Argolid]], the [[Troad]] and [[Crete]], to cause these to be taken seriously. Aegean vases have been exhibited both at [[Sèvres]] and [[Neuchâtel|Neuchatel]] since about 1840, the provenance (i.e. source or origin) being in the one case Phylakope in [[Milos|Melos]], in the other [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

Ludwig Ross, the [[Germany|German]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] appointed Curator of the Antiquities of [[History of Athens|Athens]] at the time of the establishment of the Kingdom of [[Greece]], by his explorations in the Greek islands from 1835 onwards, called attention to certain early [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]s, since known as Inselsteine; but it was not until 1878 that C. T. Newton demonstrated these to be no strayed [[Phoenicia]]n products. In 1866 primitive structures were discovered on the island of Therasia by quarrymen extracting pozzolana, a [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] [[volcanic ash]], for the [[Suez Canal]] works. When this discovery was followed up in 1870, on the neighbouring [[Santorini|Santorini (Thera)]], by representatives of the French School at [[Athens]], much pottery of a class now known immediately to precede the typical late Aegean ware, and many stone and metal objects, were found. These were dated by the [[geologist]] Ferdinand A. Fouqué, somewhat arbitrarily, to 2000 BC, by consideration of the superincumbent eruptive stratum.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

Meanwhile, in 1868, tombs at [[Ialysus]] in [[Rhodes]] had yielded to [[Alfred Biliotti]] many fine painted vases of styles which were called later the third and fourth &quot;Mycenaean&quot;; but these, bought by [[John Ruskin]], and presented to the [[British Museum]], excited less attention than they deserved, being supposed to be of some local Asiatic fabric of uncertain date. Nor was a connection immediately detected between them and the objects found four years later in a tomb at Menidi in [[Attica]] and a rock-cut &quot;bee-hive&quot; grave near the Argive Heraeum.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

Even Schliemann's first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s at Hissarlik in the [[Troad]] did not excite surprise. But the &quot;Burnt City&quot; of his second stratum, revealed in 1873, with its fortifications and vases, and a hoard of [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[bronze]] objects, which the discoverer connected with it, began to arouse a curiosity which was destined presently to spread far outside the narrow circle of scholars. As soon as Schliemann came on the Mycenae graves three years later, light poured from all sides on the prehistoric period of [[Greece]]. It was recognized that the character of both the fabric and the decoration of the Mycenaean objects was not that of any well-known art. A wide range in space was proved by the identification of the Inselsteine and the Ialysus vases with the new style, and a wide range in time by collation of the earlier Theraean and Hissarlik discoveries. A relationship between objects of art described by [[Homer]] and the Mycenaean treasure was generally allowed, and a correct opinion prevailed that, while certainly posterior, the civilization of the [[Iliad]] was reminiscent of the Mycenaean.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

Schliemann got to work again at Hissarlik in 1878, and greatly increased our knowledge of the lower strata, but did not recognize the Aegean remains in his &quot;Lydian&quot; city of the sixth stratum. These were not to be fully revealed until Dr. Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who had become Schliemann's assistant in 1879, resumed the work at Hissarlik in 1892 after the first explorer's death. But by laying bare in 1884 the upper stratum of remains on the rock of [[Tiryns]], Schliemann made a contribution to our knowledge of prehistoric domestic life which was amplified two years later by Christos Tsountas's discovery of the palace at Mycenae. Schliemann's work at Tiryns was not resumed till 1905, when it was proved, as had long been suspected, that an earlier palace underlies the one he had exposed.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

From 1886 dates the finding of Mycenaean [[sepulchre]]s outside the Argolid, from which, and from the continuation of Tsountas's exploration of the buildings and lesser graves at Mycenae, a large treasure, independent of Schliemann's princely gift, has been gathered into the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens|National Museum]] at Athens. In that year tholos-tombs, most already pillaged but retaining some of their furniture, were excavated at Arkina and [[Eleusis]] in Attica, at [[Dimini]] near [[Volos]] in [[Thessaly]], at Kampos on the west of Mount [[Taygetus]], and at Maskarata in [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]]. The richest grave of all was explored at [[Vaphio]] in [[Laconia]] in 1889, and yielded, besides many gems and miscellaneous goldsmiths' work, two golden goblets chased with scenes of bull-hunting, and certain broken vases painted in a large bold style which remained an enigma until the excavation of [[Knossos]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=245}}

In 1890 and 1893, Staes cleared out certain less rich tholos-tombs at Thoricus in [[Attica]]; and other graves, either rock-cut &quot;bee-hives&quot; or chambers, were found at Spata and Aphidna in Attica, in [[Aegina]] and [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], at the [[Heraion of Argos|Argive Heraeum]] and [[Nafplion|Nauplia]] in the Argolid, near [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Delphi]], and not far from the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[Larissa]]. During the [[Acropolis]] excavations in Athens, which terminated in 1888, many potsherds of the Mycenaean style were found; but Olympia had yielded either none, or such as had not been recognized before being thrown away, and the temple site at [[Delphi]] produced nothing distinctively Aegean (in dating). The [[United States|American]] explorations of the Argive Heraeum, concluded in 1895, also failed to prove that site to have been important in the prehistoric time, though, as was to be expected from its neighbourhood to Mycenae itself, there were traces of occupation in the later Aegean periods.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|pp=245-246}}

Prehistoric research had now begun to extend beyond the Greek mainland. Certain central Aegean islands, [[Antiparos]], [[Ios Island|Ios]], [[Amorgos]], [[Syros]] and [[Siphnos]], were all found to be singularly rich in evidence of the Middle-Aegean period. The series of Syran-built graves, containing crouching corpses, is the best and most representative that is known in the Aegean. Melos, long marked as a source of early objects but not systematically excavated until taken in hand by the [[British School at Athens]] in 1896, yielded at Phylakope remains of all the Aegean periods, except the [[Neolithic]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

A map of [[Cyprus]] in the later [[Bronze Age]] (such as is given by J. L. Myres and M. O. Richter in Catalogue of the [[Cyprus]] Museum) shows more than 25 settlements in and about the Mesaorea district alone, of which one, that at [[Enkomi]], near the site of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], has yielded the richest Aegean treasure in precious metal found outside Mycenae. E. Chantre in 1894 picked up lustreless ware, like that of Hissariik, in central Phtygia and at Pteria, and the [[England|English]] archaeological expeditions, sent subsequently into north-western [[Anatolia]], have never failed to bring back ceramic specimens of Aegean appearance from the valleys of the Rhyndncus, Sangarius and Halys.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

In [[Egypt]] in 1887, [[Flinders Petrie]] found painted sherds of Cretan style at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]] in the [[Al Fayyum|Fayum]], and farther up the [[Nile]], at [[Amarna|Tell el-Amarna]], chanced on bits of no fewer than 800 Aegean vases in 1889. There have now been recognized in the collections at [[Cairo]], [[Florence]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Bologna]] several Egyptian imitations of the Aegean style which can be set off against the many debts which the centres of Aegean culture owed to Egypt. Two Aegean vases were found at [[Sidon]] in 1885, and many fragments of Aegean and especially Cypriot pottery have been found during recent excavations of sites in [[Philistines|Philistia]] by the Palestine Fund.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

[[Sicily]], ever since P. Orsi excavated the Sicel cemetery near Lentini in 1877, has proved a mine of early remains, among which appear in regular succession Aegean fabrics and motives of decoration from the period of the second stratum at Hissarlik. Sardinia has Aegean sites, for example, at Abini near Teti; and [[Spain]] has yielded objects recognized as Aegean from tombs near [[Cádiz|Cadiz]] and from [[Zaragoza, Spain|Saragossa]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

One land, however, has eclipsed all others in the Aegean by the wealth of its remains of all the prehistoric ages&amp;mdash; Crete; and so much so that, for the present, we must regard it as the fountainhead of Aegean civilization, and probably for long its political and social centre. The island first attracted the notice of archaeologists by the remarkable archaic Greek bronzes found in a cave on [[Mount Ida]] in 1885, as well as by [[epigraph (archeology)|epigraph]]ic [[monument]]s such as the famous law of Gortyna (also called [[Gortyn]]). But the first undoubted Aegean remains reported from it were a few objects extracted from Cnossus by Minos Kalokhairinos of Candia in 1878. These were followed by certain discoveries made in the S. plain Messara by F. Halbherr. Unsuccessful attempts at Cnossus were made by both W. J. Stillman and H. Schliemann, and A. J. Evans, coming on the scene in 1893, travelled in succeeding years about the island picking up trifles of unconsidered evidence, which gradually convinced him that greater things would eventually be found. He obtained enough to enable him to forecast the discovery of written characters, till then not suspected in Aegean civilization. The revolution of 1897–1898 opened the door to wider knowledge, and much exploration has ensued, for which see [[Crete]].{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

Thus the &quot;Aegean Area&quot; has now come to mean the [[Archipelago]] with Crete and [[Cyprus]], the Hellenic peninsula with the [[Ionian islands]], and Western [[Anatolia]]. Evidence is still wanting for the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] and [[Thrace|Thracian]] coasts. Offshoots are found in the western [[Mediterranean]] area, in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Spain]], and in the eastern Mediterranean area in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. Regarding the [[Cyrenaica]], we are still insufficiently informed.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=246}}

==Fall==
[[File:Bronze-age-collapse.svg|thumb|240px|A map of the [[Bronze Age collapse]]]]
About 1000 BC there happened a final catastrophe. The palace at Knossus was once more destroyed, and never rebuilt or re-inhabited. Iron took the place of Bronze, and Aegean art, as a living thing, ceased on the Greek mainland and in the Aegean isles including Crete, together with Aegean writing. In Cyprus, and perhaps on the south-west Anatolian coasts, there is some reason to think that the cataclysm was less complete, and Aegean art continued to languish, cut off from its fountain-head. Such artistic faculty as survived elsewhere issued in the lifeless geometric style which is reminiscent of the later Aegean, but wholly unworthy of it. Cremation took the place of burial of the dead. This great disaster, which cleared the ground for a new growth of local art, was probably due to yet another incursion of northern tribes, possessed of superior iron weapons{{mdash}}those tribes which later Greek tradition and Homer knew as the [[Dorians]]. They crushed a civilization already hard hit; and it took two or three centuries for the artistic spirit, instinct in the Aegean area, and probably preserved in suspended animation by the survival of Aegean racial elements, to blossom anew. On this conquest seems to have ensued a long period of unrest and popular movements, known to Greek tradition as the Ionian Migration and the Aeolic and Dorian &quot;colonizations&quot;, and when once more we see the Aegean area clearly, it is dominated by [[Greeks|Hellenes]], though it has not lost all memory of its earlier culture.{{sfn|Hogarth|1911|p=251}}
