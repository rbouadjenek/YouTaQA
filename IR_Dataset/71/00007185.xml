&lt;!--Paragraph 1/3: Introduction and geography:--&gt;
The '''London Borough of Croydon''' ({{audio|En-uk-LBCroydon.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[London boroughs|London borough]] in [[South London]], part of [[Outer London]]. It covers an area of {{convert|87|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}. It is the southernmost borough of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;General info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|url=http://www.londononline.co.uk/boroughs/croydon/|title=London Borough of Croydon information|publisher=London Online|accessdate=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its centre is the historic town of [[Croydon]] from which the borough takes its name; while other urban centres include [[Coulsdon]], [[Purley, London|Purley]], [[South Norwood]], and [[Thornton Heath]]. Croydon is mentioned in [[Domesday Book]], and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London. The borough is now one of London's leading business, financial and cultural centres, and its influence in entertainment and the [[arts]] contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre.

&lt;!--Paragraph 2/3: History and governance:--&gt;
The borough was formed in 1965 from the merger of the [[County Borough of Croydon]] with [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]], both of which had been within [[Surrey]]. The local authority, [[Croydon London Borough Council]], is now part of [[London Councils]], the local government association for Greater London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arms of Croydon Online&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/origins/arms.asp|title=The Arms of the London Borough of Croydon|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economy of Croydon|economic strength]] of Croydon dates back mainly to [[Croydon Airport]] which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre. Once London's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital, it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]] and tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1188970&amp;resourceID=5|title=Listed Buildings Online: Airport House|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1079299&amp;resourceID=5|title=Listed Buildings Online: Former Lodge To Croydon Airport Terminal|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croydon Council and its predecessor [[County Borough of Croydon|Croydon Corporation]] unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1954, 2000, 2002 and 2012. The area is currently going through a large regeneration project called [[Croydon Vision 2020]] which is predicted to attract more businesses and tourists to the area as well as backing Croydon's bid to become &quot;London's Third City&quot; (after the [[City of London]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boris backs Croydon city bid |author= |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/archive/2008/07/30/Top+Stories+%28lltopstories%29/2413291.Boris_backs_Croydon_city_bid/ |newspaper=[[Croydon Guardian]] |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croydon is mostly urban, though there are large suburban and rural uplands towards the south of the borough. Since 2003, Croydon has been certified as a [[List of Fairtrade settlements|Fairtrade borough]] by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]].

&lt;!--Paragraph 3/3: Places, landmarks and cultural institutions:--&gt;
The area is one of the hearts of culture in London and the [[South East of England]]. Institutions such as the major arts and entertainment centre [[Fairfield Halls]] add to the vibrancy of the borough. However, its famous fringe theatre, the [[Warehouse Theatre]], went into administration in 2012 when the council withdrew funding, and the building itself was demolished in 2013. The [[Croydon Clocktower]] was opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1994 as an arts venue featuring a library, the independent [[David Lean Cinema]] (closed by the council in 2011 after sixteen years of operating, but now partially reopened on a part-time and volunteer basis) and [[Museum of Croydon|museum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Town Hall&quot;/&gt; From 2000 to 2010, Croydon staged an annual summer festival celebrating the area's black and Indian cultural diversity, with audiences reaching over 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.croydonfestival.com/transport.html|title=Croydon Summer Festival|publisher=Croydon Festival|accessdate=6 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715214204/http://www.croydonfestival.com/transport.html|archivedate=15 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internet radio station, Croydon Radio, is run by local people for the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;croydonradio.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.croydonradio.com/ internet radio for the London Borough of Croydon].

==History==
: '' For the history of the original town see [[Croydon#History|History of Croydon]]''

The London Borough of Croydon was formed in 1965 from the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] and the [[County Borough of Croydon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arms of Croydon Online&quot;/&gt; The name Croydon comes from Crogdene or Croindone, named by the [[Saxons]] in the 8th century when they settled here, although the area had been inhabited since prehistoric times.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43053|title=Croydon: Introduction and Croydon Palace|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to derive from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''croeas deanas'', meaning &quot;the valley of the [[crocus]]es&quot;, indicating that, like [[Saffron Walden]] in Essex, it was a centre for the collection of [[saffron]].

By the time of the Norman invasion Croydon had a church, a mill and around 365 inhabitants as recorded in the Domesday Book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyweb History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croyweb.com/Basic/history.htm|title=Local history of Croydon|publisher=Croyweb|accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop Lanfranc]] lived at [[Croydon Palace]] which still stands. Visitors included [[Thomas Becket]] (another Archbishop), and royal figures such as [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Croydon book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Malden|first=H.E.|title=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4|year=1912|publisher=Victoria County History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croydon carried on through the ages as a prosperous market town, they produced charcoal, tanned leather, and ventured into brewing. Croydon was served by the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], the first public railway (horse drawn) in the world, in 1803, and by the [[Brighton Main Line|London to Brighton]] rail link in the mid-19th century, helping it to become the largest town in what was then [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyweb History&quot;/&gt;

In the 20th century Croydon became known for industries such as metal working, car manufacture and its aerodrome, [[Croydon Airport]]. Starting out during World War I as an airfield for protection against [[Zeppelin]]s, an adjacent airfield was combined, and the new aerodrome opened on 29 March 1920. It became the largest in London, and was the main terminal for international air freight into the capital. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s, and welcomed the world's pioneer aviators in its heyday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cluett|first=Douglas|author2=Joanna Bogle |author3=Bob Learmonth |title=Croydon Airport and The Battle for Britain|year=1984|location=London Borough of Sutton Libraries and Arts Services|isbn=0-907335-11-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Airways Ltd]] used the airport for a short period after redirecting from [[RAF Northolt|Northolt Aerodrome]], and Croydon was the operating base for [[Imperial Airways]]. It was partly due to the airport that Croydon suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II. As aviation technology progressed, however, and aircraft became larger and more numerous, it was recognised in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with the ever-increasing volume of air traffic. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. It was superseded as the main airport by both [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]] (see below). The air terminal, now known as Airport House, has been restored, and has a hotel and museum in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyweb History&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1950s and through the 1960s the council commercialised the centre of Croydon with massive development of office blocks and the [[Whitgift Centre]] which was formerly the biggest in-town shopping centre in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;urbanisation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/13/2399|title=Modernism vs Urban Renaissance: Negotiating Post-war Heritage in English City Centres|publisher=Urban Studies Journal|accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre was officially opened in October 1970 by the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]]. The original [[Whitgift School]] there had moved to Haling Park, South Croydon in the 1930s; the replacement school on the site, Whitgift Middle School, now the [[Trinity School of John Whitgift]], moved to Shirley Park in the 1960s, when the buildings were demolished.

The borough council unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1965, 2000 and again in 2002. If it had been successful, it would have been the third local authority in [[Greater London]] to hold that status, along with the [[City of London]] and the [[City of Westminster]]. At present the London Borough of Croydon is the second most populous [[local government district]] of England without city status, [[Kirklees]] being the first. Croydon's applications were refused as it was felt not to have an identity separate from the rest of Greater London. In 1965 it was described as &quot;...now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs&quot; and in 2000 as having &quot;no particular identity of its own&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;beckett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002|series=Historical Urban Studies|author=Beckett, J.

Croydon, [[2011 England riots|in common with many other areas]], was hit by extensive rioting in August 2011.

Croydon is currently going through a vigorous regeneration plan, called [[Croydon Vision 2020]]. This will change the [[urban planning]] of central Croydon completely. Its main aims are to make Croydon ''London's Third City'' and the hub of retail, business, culture and living in South London and South East England.&lt;ref name=&quot;croydon expo 07&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonexpo.com/|title=Home of the Croydon Exp07|publisher=[[Croydon Expo]]|accessdate=5 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404154856/http://www.croydonexpo.com/|archivedate=4 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was showcased in a series of events called [[Croydon Expo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;regeneration croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=944|title=Croydon Expo to be a Regeneration Showcase|publisher=Croydon Conservatives|accessdate=5 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211100836/http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=944|archive-date=11 February 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was aimed at business and residents in the London Borough of Croydon, to demonstrate the £3.5bn development projects the Council wishes to see in Croydon in the next ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc croydon expo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/02/21/regeneration_feature.shtml |title=New look Croydon on display|work=[[BBC London]]|accessdate=5 April 2008 | location=London | first=Evadney | last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Croydon London Borough Council]] has seventy councillors elected in 24 wards.

Croydon is a [[cabinet-style council]], and the Leader heads a ten-person cabinet, its members responsible for areas such as education or planning. There is a Shadow Cabinet drawn from the sole opposition party. A backbench cross-party scrutiny and overview committee is in place to hold the executive cabinet to account.

From the borough's creation in 1965 until 1994 the council saw continuous control under first Conservatives and Residents' Ratepayers councillors up to 1986 and then Conservatives. From 1994 to 2006 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] councillors controlled the council. After a further eight-year period of Conservative control the Labour group secured a ten-seat majority in the local council elections on 22 May 2014. Councillor Tony Newman returned to lead the council for Labour.

In the 2014 local elections the Labour party gained all the seats in the Ashburton and Waddon wards and gained the one seat held by the Conservatives in the New Addington ward. The election marked the first time that Ashburton ward had been represented by Labour. Elected as a Labour councillor in Waddon was Croydon Central's previous Conservative then Independent MP and leader of the Conservatives on Croydon council up to 2005, Andrew Pelling.

At the [[2010 Croydon Council election|2010 Croydon local elections]] seats lost previously in Addiscombe, South Norwood and Upper Norwood were retaken by Labour Party councillors; in New Addington the Conservative party gained a councillor, the first time that the Conservatives had taken a seat there since 1968. The composition of the council after the 2010 elections was Conservatives 37, Labour 33.

Mike Fisher, Conservative group leader since May 2005, was named as Council Leader following the Conservative victory in 2006.
; Since 2000
At the [[2006 Croydon Council election|2006 local elections]] Conservative councillors regained control in gaining 12&amp;nbsp;councillors, taking ten seats from Labour in Addiscombe, Waddon, South Norwood and Upper Norwood and ousting the single [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] councillor in Coulsdon.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005 election&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/democracy/dande/elections/results/general |title=Results of the 2005 General Election held for Croydon Council |publisher=Croydon Council |accessdate=10 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027083047/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/democracy/dande/elections/results/general |archivedate=27 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Map of wards in Croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf |title=How the wards look |publisher=Croydon Council |accessdate=20 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026182529/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf |archivedate=26 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 2006 and 2010 elections, a by-election in February 2007 saw a large swing to Labour from the Conservatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Whereas 6% Conservative to Labour [[swing (politics)|swings]] were produced in the two previous by-elections to 2006, won by a councillor from the incumbent party (in both cases the party of a councillor who had died).{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Councillor Jonathan Driver, who became Mayor in 2008, died unexpectedly at the close of the year, causing a by-election in highly marginal Waddon which was successfully held by the Conservatives.

From February 2005 until May 2006 the Leader of Croydon Council was [[Labour Co-operative]] Councillor Tony Newman, succeeding Hugh Malyan.

===Westminster representation===

The borough is covered by three parliamentary constituencies: these are [[Croydon North (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North]], [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] and [[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon South]].

===Civic history===
For much of its history, Croydon Council was controlled by the Conservative Party or Conservative-leaning independents. Former Croydon councillors include former MPs [[Andrew Pelling]], [[Vivian Bendall]], [[David Congdon]], [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]] and [[Reg Prentice]], [[London Assembly]] member [[Valerie Shawcross]], [[Peter Spencer Bowness|Lord Bowness]], [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington]] ([[Master of the Rolls]]) and [[H.T. Muggeridge]], MP and father of [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The first Mayor of the newly created [[county borough]] was [[Jabez Balfour]], later a disgraced Member of Parliament. Former Conservative Director of Campaigning, [[Gavin Barwell]], was a Croydon councillor between 1998 and 2010 and was the MP for Croydon Central from 2010 until 2017. [[Sarah Jones (politician)]] won the Croydon Central seat for Labour in 2017.  Croydon North has a Labour MP, [[Steve Reed (politician)]], and Croydon South has a Conservative MP, [[Chris Philp]].
 
Some 10,000 people work directly or indirectly for the council, at its main offices at Bernard Weatherill House or in its schools, care homes, housing offices or work depots. The council is generally well regarded, having made important improvements in education and social services. However, there have been concerns over benefits, leisure services and waste collection. Although the council has one of London's lower rates of council tax, there are claims{{who|date=December 2017}} that it is too high and that resources are wasted.

The [[Mayors in England|Mayor of Croydon]] for 2010-11 was Councillor Avril Slipper. The Leader is Cllr Mike Fisher and the Deputy Leaders are Cllr Tim Pollard and Cllr Dudley Mead. The Chief Executive since 7 July 2007 has been Jon Rouse.{{Fix|text=out of date?}}

===Government buildings===
[[File:Croydon clocktower.jpg|thumb|Croydon's Victorian Town Hall]]
[[Croydon Clocktower|Croydon Town Hall]] on Katharine Street in [[Croydon|Central Croydon]] houses the committee rooms, the mayor's and other councillors' offices, electoral services and the arts and heritage services.
The present Town Hall is Croydon's third. The first town hall is thought to have been built in either 1566 or 1609.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Town Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/town_hall.asp|title=Katharine Street, Town Hall: Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was built in 1808 to serve the growing town but was demolished after the present town hall was erected in 1895.

The 1808 building cost £8,000, which was regarded as an enormous sum for those days and was perhaps as controversial as the administrative building Bernard Weatherill House opened for occupation in 2013 and reputed to have cost £220,000,000. The early 19th century building was known initially as &quot;Courthouse&quot; as, like its predecessor and successor, the local court met there. The building stood on the western side of the High Street near to the junction with Surrey Street, the location of the town's market. The building became inadequate for the growing local administrative responsibilities and stood at a narrow point of a High Street in need of widening.

The present town hall was designed by local architect Charles Henman&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Town Hall&quot;/&gt; and was officially opened by the Prince and [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]] on 19 May 1896. It was constructed in red brick, sourced from [[Wrotham]] in Kent, with [[Portland stone]] dressings and green [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]] [[slate]]s for the roof. It also housed the court and most central council employees.

The Borough's incorporation in 1883 and a desire to improve central Croydon with improvements to traffic flows and the removal of social deprivation in Middle Row prompted the move to a new configuration of town hall provision. The second closure of the Central Railway Station provided the Corporation with the opportunity to buy the station land from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company for £11,500 to provide the site for the new town hall. Indeed, the council hoped to be able to sell on some of the land purchased with enough for municipal needs and still &quot;leave a considerable margin of land which might be disposed of&quot;. The purchase of the failed railway station came despite local leaders having successfully urged the re-opening of the poorly patronised railway station. The railway station re-opening had failed to be a success so freeing up the land for alternative use.

Parts, including the former court rooms, have been converted into the [[Museum of Croydon]] and exhibition galleries. The original public library was converted into the [[David Lean Cinema]], part of the [[Croydon Clocktower]]. The Braithwaite Hall is used for events and performances. The town hall was renovated in the mid-1990s and the imposing central staircase, long closed to the public and kept for councillors only, was re-opened in 1994. The civic complex, meanwhile, was substantially added to, with buildings across Mint Walk and the 19-floor Taberner House to house the rapidly expanding corporation's employees.

[[File:CroydonTabHouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Croydon Council's offices were in [[Taberner House]] until September 2013]]
[[Ruskin House]] is the headquarters of Croydon's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], Trade Union and [[Co-operative Party|Co-operative]] movements and is itself a co-operative with shareholders from organisations across the three movements. In the 19th century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre of London. It was said that, at the turn of the 20th century, approximately £10,000 was spent in Croydon's taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town's public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and [[Georgina King Lewis]], a keen member of the [[Croydon United Temperance Council]], took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement. The first Ruskin House was highly successful, and there has been two more since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruskin House&quot;&gt;This text was taken, with permission, from ''Ruskin House: A History'', M. Tiedemann &amp; E. Daisley. For more information see [[Talk:Ruskin House|here]] {{cite book|author1=M. Tiedemann|author2=E. Daisley|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current house was officially opened in 1967 by the then Labour Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]]. Today, Ruskin House continues to serve as the headquarters of the Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative movements in Croydon, hosting a range of meetings and being the base for several labour movement groups. Office tenants include the headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Britain]] and Croydon Labour Party. [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]], the MP for [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]], had offices in the building, until he was defeated by [[Andrew Pelling]] and is now the Labour representative standing for [[Swansea West (UK Parliament constituency)|Swansea West]] in Wales.

[[File:Croydon Council.JPG|thumb|Bernard Weatherill House, home to Croydon Council from September 2013]]
[[Taberner House]] was built between 1964 and 1967, designed by architect H. Thornley, with Allan Holt and Hugh Lea as borough engineers. Although the council had needed extra space since the 1920s, it was only with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building, being demolished in 2014, was in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided. It has its elegant upper slab block narrowing towards both ends, a formal device which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] in Milan. It was named after Ernest Taberner OBE, Town Clerk from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taberner House names&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/taberner_house.asp|title=Park Lane, Taberner House:Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until September 2013, Taberner House housed most of the council's central employees and was the main location for the public to access information and services, particularly with respect to housing.

In September 2013, Council staff moved into [[Bernard Weatherill House]] in Fell Road, (named after the former Speaker of the House and Member of Parliament for Croydon North-East). Staff from the Met Police, NHS, Jobcentre Plus, Croydon Credit Union, Citizens Advice Bureau as well as 75 services from the council all moved to the new building.

==Geography and climate==
The borough is in the far south of London, with the [[M25 motorway|M25 orbital motorway]] stretching to the south of it, between Croydon and [[Tandridge (district)|Tandridge]]. To the north and east, the borough mainly borders the [[London Borough of Bromley]], and in the north west the boroughs of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]]. The boroughs of [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] are located directly to the west. It{{clarify|date=December 2017}} is at the head of the [[River Wandle]], just to the north of a significant gap in the [[North Downs]]. It lies {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Central London, and the earliest settlement may have been a Roman staging post on the London-Portslade road, although conclusive evidence has not yet been found. The main town centre houses a great variety of well-known stores on [[North End, Croydon|North End]] and two shopping centres. It was pedestrianised in 1989 to attract people back to the town centre. Another shopping centre called [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]] was due to open in 2012 but has since been scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Croydon Council abandons agreement to build new shopping centre |first=Andrew |last=Worden |url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/news/Breaking-news-Croydon-Council-abandons-agreement-build-new-shopping-centre/article-985303-detail/article.html/ |newspaper=[[Croydon Advertiser]] |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822185205/http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/news/Breaking-news-Croydon-Council-abandons-agreement-build-new-shopping-centre/article-985303-detail/article.html |archive-date=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thornton Heath]] is a town, to the northwest of Croydon, which holds Croydon's principal hospital [[Mayday University Hospital|Mayday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heathtpond&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/thorntonheath.asp|title=History of the Thornton Heath area|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Upper Norwood]] is north of Croydon, on a mainly elevated area of the borough. [[Waddon]] is a residential area, mainly based on the [[Purley Way]] retail area, to the west of the borough. [[Woodside, London|Woodside]] is located to the northeast of the borough, with streets based on [[Woodside Green]], a small sized area of green land.&lt;ref name=&quot;woodsidehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/woodside.asp|title=History of the Woodside area|publisher= Croydon Online|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; And finally [[Whyteleafe]] is a town, right to the edge of Croydon with some areas in the Surrey district of Tandridge.

Croydon is a gateway to the south from central London, with some major roads running through it. [[Purley Way]], part of the [[A23 road|A23]], was built to by-pass Croydon town centre. It is one of the busiest roads in the borough, and is the site of several major retail developments including one of only 18 [[IKEA]] stores in the country, built on the site of the former power station.&lt;ref name=&quot;purleywayhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/purleyway.asp|title=History of the Purley Way retail district|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A23 continues southward as Brighton Road, which is the main route running towards the south from [[South Croydon|Croydon]] to [[Purley, London|Purley]]. The centre of Croydon is very congested, and the urban planning has since become out of date and quite inadequate, due to the expansion of Croydon's main shopping area and office blocks. [[Wellesley Road]] is a north-south [[dual carriageway]] that cuts through the centre of the town, and makes it hard to walk between the town centre's two railway stations. [[Croydon Vision 2020]] includes a plan for a more pedestrian-friendly replacement. It has also been named as one of the worst roads for cyclists in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;cycle names&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://crapcyclelanesofcroydon.blogspot.com/2007/05/jug-handle-wellesley-road.html|title=The &quot;jug handle&quot; - Wellesley Road|publisher=Crap Cycle Lanes of Croydon|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the [[Croydon Underpass]] beneath the junction of George Street and [[Wellesley Road]]/Park Lane started in the early 1960s, mainly to alleviate traffic congestion on Park Lane, above the underpass. The [[Croydon Flyover]] is also near the underpass, and next to [[Taberner House]]. It mainly leads traffic on to [[Duppas Hill]], towards Purley Way with links to [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Kingston upon Thames]]. The major junction on the flyover is for [[Old Town, Croydon|Old Town]], which is also a large three-lane road.

Croydon covers an area of 86.52&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the 256th [[List of English districts by area|largest district in England]]. Croydon's physical features consist of many hills and rivers that are spread out across the borough and into the [[North Downs]], Surrey and the rest of South London. [[Addington Hills]] is a major hilly area to the south of London and is recognised as a significant obstacle to the growth of London from its origins as a port on the north side of the river, to a large circular city. The [[Great North Wood]] is a former natural oak forest that covered the [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham Ridge]] and the southern reaches of the [[River Effra]] and its tributaries. The most notable tree, called Vicar's Oak, marked the boundary of four ancient parishes; [[Lambeth]], [[Camberwell]], Croydon and [[Bromley]]. John Aubrey&lt;ref&gt;John Aubrey ''Natural History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey'', 1718, vol. 2, p. 33,&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this &quot;ancient remarkable tree&quot; in the past tense as early as 1718, but according to JB Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Wilson &amp; H.A. Wilson ''The Story of Norwood'' {{ISBN|0-9515384-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vicar's Oak survived until 1825. The [[River Wandle]] is also a major tributary of the [[River Thames]], where it stretches to [[Wandsworth]] and [[Putney]] for {{convert|9|mi|km}} from its main source in [[Waddon]].

Croydon has a [[temperate]] climate in common with most areas of Great Britain, it is similar to that of [[Greenwich]] in [[Inner London]]: its [[Humid temperate climate|Köppen climate classification]] is ''Cfb''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldclimate.com/ WorldClimate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N51W000+1102+03776W Temperature data)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mean annual temperature of 9.6&amp;nbsp;°C is similar to that experienced throughout the Weald, and slightly cooler than nearby areas such as the Sussex coast and central London.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif |title=Mean Temperature Annual Average |publisher=[[Met Office]] |accessdate=22 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203143739/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif |archivedate=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall is considerably below England's average (1971–2000) level of 838&amp;nbsp;mm, and every month is drier overall than the England average.&lt;ref name=&quot;rainmean&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england.html |title=Met Office: averages 1971–2000 |accessdate=22 August 2007 |publisher=Met Office |year=2007 |work=Met Office website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605024000/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{further|Architecture of Croydon|List of tallest buildings and structures in Croydon}}
The skyline of Croydon has significantly changed over the past 50 years. High rise buildings, mainly office blocks, now dominate the skyline. The most notable of these buildings include Croydon Council's headquarters [[Taberner House]], which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] of [[Milan]], and the [[Nestlé Tower]], the former UK headquarters of [[Nestlé]].

In recent years, the development of [[Tall buildings in London|tall buildings]], such as the approved [[Croydon Vocational Tower]] and [[Wellesley Square]], has been encouraged in the [[London Plan]], which will lead to the erection of new skyscrapers over the next few years as London goes through a high-rise boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London - Full Summary of Projects|publisher=Will Fox, SkyscraperCity.com|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=46|accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No. 1 Croydon]], formerly the NLA Tower, Britain's 88th tallest tower,&lt;ref name=&quot;NLA Tower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/snuk_list.htm|title=Britain's Tallest 100 Buildings by Height|publisher=Sky Scraper News|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; close to [[East Croydon station]], is an example of 1970s architecture. The tower was originally nicknamed the ''Threepenny bit building'', as it resembles a stack of pre-decimalisation [[Threepence (British coin)|Threepence]] coins, which were 12-sided. It is now most commonly called The Octagon, being 8-sided.

[[Lunar House]] is another high-rise building. Like other government office buildings on Wellesley Road, such as '''[[Apollo House (Croydon)|Apollo House]]''', the name of the building was inspired by the [[Project Apollo|US moon landings]] (In the Croydon suburb of New Addington there is a [[public house]], built during the same period, called ''The Man '''on''' the Moon''). Lunar House houses the Home Office building for Visas and Immigration. Apollo House houses The Border Patrol Agency.

A new generation of buildings are being considered by the council as part of [[Croydon Vision 2020]], so that the borough doesn't lose its title of having the &quot;largest office space in the south east&quot;, excluding central London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croydon Gateway - Arrowcroft Scheme|publisher=Emporis|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/nc/ne/?id=101018|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as [[Wellesley Square]], which will be a mix of residential and retail with an eye-catching colour design and [[100 George Street]] a proposed modern office block are incorporated in this vision.

Notable events that have happened to Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project to create the largest single urban lighting project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.&lt;ref name=&quot;skyline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=38&amp;t=2|title=Croydon Skyline|accessdate=12 October 2007|publisher=Millennium Commission|year=2003|work=Croydon Skyline Millennium Trust|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031104234739/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=38&amp;t=2|archivedate=4 November 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population change===
The table shows details on the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last available census data. Although the London Borough of Croydon has existed only since 1965, earlier figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es that would later be absorbed into the authority.

The main employment sectors of the Borough is retail and enterprise which is mainly based in Central Croydon. Major employers are well-known companies, who hold stores or offices in the town. [[Purley Way]] is a major employer of people, looking for jobs as sales assistants, sales consultants and store managerial jobs. [[IKEA Croydon]], when it was built in 1992, brought many non-skilled jobs to Croydon. The store, which is a total size of 23,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IkeaNearYouView?storeId=7&amp;catalogId=11001&amp;langId=-20&amp;StoreName=croydon |title=IKEA Group stores |publisher=IKEA Group corporate site |accessdate=30 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621004651/http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IkeaNearYouView?storeId=7&amp;catalogId=11001&amp;langId=-20&amp;StoreName=croydon |archivedate=21 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; took over the former site of Croydon Power station, which had led to the unemployment of many skilled workers.

The  [[Tramlink]] light rail system opened in 2000, serving the borough and surrounding areas. Its network consists of three lines, from [[Elmers End tram stop|Elmers End]] to West Croydon, from [[Beckenham Junction tram stop|Beckenham]] to West Croydon, and from [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]] to [[Wimbledon tram stop|Wimbledon]], with all three lines running via the Croydon loop on which it is centred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=24 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the only tram system in London but there is another light rail system, the [[Docklands Light Railway]]. It serves [[Mitcham]], [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Addiscombe]] and the [[Purley Way]] retail and industrial area amongst others.

===Road===
Croydon is linked into the national motorway network via the [[M23 motorway|M23]] and [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway. The M25 skirts the south of the borough, linking Croydon with other parts of London and the surrounding counties; the M23 branches from the M25 close to Coulsdon, linking the town with the south coast, [[Crawley]], [[Reigate]], and [[Gatwick Airport]]. The [[A23 road|A23]] connects the borough with the motorways. The A23 is the major trunk road through Croydon, linking it with central London, East Sussex, Horsham, and Littlehaven. The old London to Brighton road, passes through the west of the borough on [[Purley Way]], bypassing the commercial centre of Croydon which it once did.

The [[A22 road|A22]] and A23 are the major trunk roads through Croydon. These both run north-south, connecting to each other in [[Purley, London|Purley]]. The A22 connects Croydon, its starting point, to [[East Grinstead]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Uckfield]], and [[Eastbourne]]. Other major roads generally radiate spoke-like from the city centre. [[Wellesley Road]] is an urban [[dual carriageway]] which cuts through the middle of the central business district. It was constructed in the 1960s as part of a planned ring road for Croydon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/croydonringroad/|title=CBRD - In Depth - Croydon Ring Road|accessdate=9 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619132406/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/croydonringroad/|archive-date=19 June 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes an [[Croydon Underpass|underpass]], which allows traffic to avoid going into the town centre.

===Air===
The closest international airport to Croydon is [[Gatwick Airport]], which is located {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the town centre. Gatwick Airport opened in August 1930 as an aerodrome and is a major international operational base for [[British Airways]], [[EasyJet]] and [[Virgin Atlantic]]. It currently handles around 35 million passengers a year, making it London's second largest airport, and the second busiest airport in the United Kingdom after [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]. Heathrow, [[London City Airport|London City]] and [[Luton Airport|Luton]] airports all lie within a two hours' drive of Croydon. Gatwick and Luton Airports are connected to Croydon by [[Thameslink|frequent direct trains]], while Heathrow is accessible by the [[London Buses route X26|route X26]] bus.

===Cycling===
Although hilly, Croydon is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on one of the [[Connect2]] schemes which are part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route running around Croydon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustransconnect2.org.uk/schemes/project_detail.php?id=147|title=London - Croydon Park Links|year=2008|accessdate=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Downs]], an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on- and off-road cyclists, is so close to Croydon that part of the park lies within the borough boundary, and there are routes into the park almost from the civic centre.

===Travel to work===
In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: driving a car or van, 20.2% of all residents aged 16–74; train, 59.5%; bus, minibus or coach, 7.5%; on foot, 5.1%; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 4.3%; work mainly at or from home, 2.9%; passenger in a car or van, 1.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census: QS701EW Method of travel to work, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs701ew.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=23 November 2013}} Percentages are of all residents aged 16-74 including those not in employment. Respondents could only pick one mode, specified as the journey's longest part by distance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public services==
[[File:Cane Hill Asylum.jpg|thumb|[[Cane Hill]]]]
[[Home Office]] policing in Croydon is provided by the [[Metropolitan Police]]. The force's Croydon arm have their head offices for policing on [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] next to the [[Fairfield Halls]] and [[Croydon College]] in central Croydon.

[[Croydon University Hospital]], formerly known as Mayday Hospital, built on a {{convert|19|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in Thornton Heath at the west of Croydon's boundaries with [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], is a large [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] hospital administrated by [[NHS Trust|Mayday Healthcare NHS Trust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS Trust&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/primary_care_10_02.pdf |title=Strategic Health Authorities |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=17 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627171309/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/primary_care_10_02.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former names of the hospital include the Croydon Union Infirmary from 1885 to 1923 and the Mayday Road Hospital from 1923 to around 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayday Hospital&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=168&amp;page=37|title=The National Archives:Mayday Hospital, Croydon|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a District General Hospital with a 24-hour [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]] department. [[NHS Direct]] has a regional centre based at the hospital. The [[NHS Trust]] also provides services at Purley War Memorial Hospital, in [[Purley, London|Purley]]. Croydon General Hospital was on London Road but services transferred to Mayday, as the size of this hospital was insufficient to cope with the growing population of the borough. Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Centre and the Emergency Minor Treatment Centre are other smaller hospitals operated by the Mayday in the borough. [[Cane Hill]] was a [[psychiatric hospital]] in Coulsdon.

===Waste management===
[[Waste management]] is co-ordinated by the local authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waste management&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/waste/docs/wastestrat_all.pdf |title=Rethinking rubbish in London |publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] |accessdate=11 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210414/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/waste/docs/wastestrat_all.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other [[waste disposal authorities in Greater London]], Croydon's rubbish is collected independently and isn't part of a waste authority unit.

The borough of Croydon has 14 libraries, a joint library and a mobile library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/libraries/find-your-library|title=Find your library|last=webmaster@croydon.gov.uk|first=Web Team|work=London Borough of Croydon|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the libraries were built a long time ago and therefore have become outdated, so the council started updating a few including [[Ashburton Library]] which moved from its former spot into the state-of-the-art [[Ashburton Learning Village]] complex which is on the former site of the old 'A Block' of [[Oasis Academy Shirley Park|Ashburton Community School]] which is now situated inside the centre. The library is now on one floor. This format was planned to be rolled out across all of the council's libraries but what was seen as costing too much.{{Clarify|date=March 2016}}

[[South Norwood Library]], [[New Addington Library]], Shirley Library, Selsdon Library, Sanderstead Library, Broad Green, Purley Library, Coulsdon Library and Bradmore Green Library are examples of older council libraries. The main library is [[Croydon Central Library]] which holds many references, newspaper archives and a tourist information point (one of three in southeast London). [[Upper Norwood Library]] is a joint library with the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. This means that both councils fund the library and its resources, but even though Lambeth have nearly doubled their funding for the library in the past several years Croydon has kept it the same,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tessa Jowell Labour campaign article&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.tessajowell.net/?PageId=4bd1346c-8ec2-36f4-ed45-ba76a9cef35eschoolType=all |title=Tessa Jowell joins campaign for joint funding of Upper Norwood Library |publisher=Labour Party |accessdate=24 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724093117/http://www.tessajowell.net/?PageId=4bd1346c-8ec2-36f4-ed45-ba76a9cef35eschoolType%3Dall |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; doubting the future of the library.

There are more than 35 churches in the borough, with [[Croydon Minster]] being the main one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Churches in LB Croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2003 |url=http://www.eden.co.uk/churches/croydon/index.html |title=Croydon Churches |publisher=Eden/National Church Database |accessdate=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101125313/http://www.eden.co.uk/churches/croydon/index.html |archivedate=1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This church was founded in Saxon times, since there is a record of &quot;a priest of Croydon&quot; in 960, although the first record of a church building is in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086). In its final medieval form, the church was mainly a Perpendicular-style structure, but this was severely damaged by fire in 1867, following which only the tower, south porch and outer walls remained. Under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott the church was rebuilt, incorporating the remains and essentially following the design of the medieval building, and was reconsecrated in 1870. It still contains several important monuments and fittings saved from the old church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Parish Church&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|url=http://www.croydonminster.org/about-us/history|title=History of Croydon Minster|publisher=Croydon Minster|accessdate=30 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324185511/http://www.croydonminster.org/about-us/history|archive-date=24 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twinning==

The London Borough of Croydon is twinned with the municipality of [[Arnhem]] which is located in the east of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnhem Link&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/arnhem.asp|title=Croydon and Arnhem Link|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Arnhem is one of the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|20 largest cities in the Netherlands]]. They have been twinned since 1946 after both towns had suffered extensive bomb damage during the recently ended war. There is also a [[Guyana|Guyanese]] link supported by the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guyana&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croydononline.org/community_information/list-fse.asp?wtT=2034|title=The community link with Guyana, South America|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment in the tobacco industry==
In September 2009 it was revealed that Croydon Council had around £20m{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} of its pension fund for employees invested in shares in [[Imperial Tobacco]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[British American Tobacco]]. Members of the opposition Labour group on the council, who had banned such shareholdings when in control, described this as &quot;dealing in death&quot; and inconsistent with the council's tobacco control strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/4645311.Croydon_Council_accused_of__trading_in_death__after_shares_in_tobacco_firm_revealed/|title=Croydon Council accused of 'trading in death' after shares in tobacco firm revealed|date=29 September 2009|work=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
