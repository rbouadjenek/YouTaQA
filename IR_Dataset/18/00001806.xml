At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his &quot;cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant&quot; character.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt; As a boy, he played several sports, heavily influenced by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;/&gt; He picked up his first [[barbell]] in 1960, when his [[association football|soccer]] coach took his team to a local gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; At the age of 14, he chose [[bodybuilding]] over soccer as a career.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-074214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=August 31, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101220131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |archivedate=November 1, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said, &quot;I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start [[Olympic weightlifting|olympic lifting]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;/&gt; However, his official website biography claims that &quot;at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Everything |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416234020/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |archivedate=April 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech in 2001, he said, &quot;My own plan formed when I was 14 years old.

Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in [[Graz]], where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as [[Reg Park]], [[Steve Reeves]], and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] on the big screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt; When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: &quot;As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.&quot; In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, so that he could train even when it was closed. &quot;It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.&quot; When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: &quot;I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a [[John Wayne]] movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Ask Arnold |year=2000 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203926/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He was [[drunk driving|driving drunk]] and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named [[Patrick M. Knapp Schwarzenegger|Patrick]].

Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''Pumping Iron&amp;nbsp;– 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=October 6, 2003 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3603696/The-girl-who-cant-escape-Arnie.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |first=Oliver |last=Poole |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410221914/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2003%2F10%2F02%2Fbfarni02.xml&amp;page=1 |archivedate=April 10, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what &quot;would now be called child abuse&quot; at the hands of his father: &quot;My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nazi&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Reagan+Schwarzenegger1984.jpg|thumb|upright|rignt|Schwarzenegger with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984]]

Schwarzenegger served in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian Army]] in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; He went [[AWOL]] during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: &quot;Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.&quot; He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted &quot;best-built man of Europe&quot;, which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. &quot;The [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;per&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the [[Universe Championships#History|NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner [[Chester Yorton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

Charles &quot;Wag&quot; Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in [[Forest Gate|Forest Gate, London]]. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the [[East End of London]] helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece |location=London |work=The Times |title=Wag Bennett bodybuilder who helped Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=October 2, 2008 |first=Lindsay |last=McIntosh |access-date=October 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525033754/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece |archive-date=May 25, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis Arnold Schwarzenegger: Made in Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817080410/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis |date=August 17, 2010 }}, [[British Film Institute]].

The immigration law firm Siskind &amp; Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an [[illegal immigrant]] at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his [[visa (document)|visa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Possible Visa Violations&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Siskind |last=Bland |title=Schwarzenegger May Have Violated Terms Of Non-Immigrant Visa |date=September 4, 2007 |url=http://www.visalaw.com/03sep4/15sep403.html |work=VISALAW.COM |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220094159/http://www.visalaw.com/03sep4/15sep403.html |archivedate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[LA Weekly]]'' would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who &quot;overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot; /&gt;

In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide ''Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder'' became a huge success.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger A name to be reckoned with |url=http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/ |website=Rotten.com |accessdate=April 9, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219083706/http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/ |archivedate=December 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paslay |first1=Christopher |title=The Village Proposal: Education as a Shared Responsibility |date=September 1, 2011 |publisher=R&amp;L Education |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g6rU59neX34C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=schwarzenegger+%22after+dark%22 |accessdate=April 9, 2016|isbn=9781610480611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to taking an assortment of courses at [[Santa Monica College]] in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] as part of UCLA's extension program, Schwarzenegger had by then accumulated enough credits so as to be &quot;within striking distance&quot; of graduation. In 1979 he enrolled in the [[University of Wisconsin–Superior]] as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior in order to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and received his [[bachelor's degree]] in business administration and marketing.

Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a [[conflict of interest]] since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of [[dietary supplement]]s in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;megerian&quot;&gt;Megerian, Chris. (March 1, 2013). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schwarzenegger-20130302,0,1141770.story ''Schwarzenegger to be executive editor of magazines''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302141955/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schwarzenegger-20130302,0,1141770.story |date=March 2, 2013 }} ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;megerian&quot; /&gt; American Media Inc., which owns ''Muscle &amp; Fitness'' and ''Flex'', announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;megerian&quot; /&gt;

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4&amp;nbsp;– [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [England], 1&amp;nbsp;– [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 [[Arnold Classic]] he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc |title=Ask Arnold Training Seminar – Arnold Schwarzenegger Talks Bodybuilding Advice – Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220212802/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powerlifting/weightlifting===
During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several [[Olympic weightlifting]] and [[powerlifting]] contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Pro Bodybuilding Profile |url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/bodybuilders-arnold.html |website=Bodybuilding.com |language=en |date=11 October 2015 |access-date=July 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705212606/https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/bodybuilders-arnold.html |archive-date=July 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;gmv.com.au&quot; /&gt;

In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the [[Munich]] stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&amp;nbsp;kg / 560&amp;nbsp;lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.

===Mr. Olympia===
Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming [[Mr. Olympia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. Although significantly taller and heavier, [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, &quot;Why not compete?&quot; Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary &quot;[[The Comeback (1980 film)|The Comeback]]&quot;) was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs)&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO0twE91JiA|title=Arnold's Worst Physique VS Arnold's Best Physique|last=Nick's Strength and Power|date=|website=|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subpar conditioning shouldn't have allowed him to go ahead of a very competitive lineup that year;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Mike Mentzer]], in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getbig.com/results/e-mroly.htm|title=Mr. Olympia Contest Results|website=www.getbig.com|access-date=2019-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605130530/http://www.getbig.com/results/e-mroly.htm|archive-date=June 5, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ironmanmagazine.com/the-1980-mr-olympia-controversy/|title=The 1980 Mr. Olympia Controversy {{!}} Iron Man Magazine|last=Hansen|first=John|website=www.ironmanmagazine.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190131092902/https://www.ironmanmagazine.com/the-1980-mr-olympia-controversy/|archive-date=January 31, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steroid use===
Schwarzenegger has acknowledged using [[Performance-enhancing substance|performance-enhancing]] [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that &quot;steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when [[Weight cutting|cutting up]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conan the Politician |publisher=[[ESPN]] |url=http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Farrey |first=Tom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329223151/http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |archivedate=March 29, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has called the drugs &quot;tissue building&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold Steroids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold &amp; Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 8, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his [[#Accidents and injuries|later heart problems]]. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 [[Defamation#Germany|libel]] judgment against him in a German court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Schwarzenegger Wins German Lawsuit |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |agency=United Press International |date=December 1, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418105938/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |archivedate=April 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie settles $50m libel case |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |date=December 22, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412023333/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |archive-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
===Early roles===
Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1969's ''[[Hercules in New York]]''. Credited under the [[stage name]] &quot;Arnold Strong&quot;, his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; His second film appearance was as a [[deaf-mute]] mob hitman in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: &quot;It was very difficult for me in the beginning&amp;nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt;

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the [[bodybuilding]] film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977),&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427071904/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |archive-date=April 27, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The San Pedro Beach Bums]]'' and the ABC [[police procedural]] ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]].

===Action superstar===
Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt; This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |work=Empire |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, ''[[Rio Carnival|Carnival]] in Rio''. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in [[James Cameron]]'s science fiction [[thriller film]] ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanleam&quot; /&gt; Following this, Schwarzenegger made ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot; /&gt;
During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and [[Sylvester Stallone]] becoming international stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat (1988 film)|Red Heat]]'' (1988).

[[File:Chth arnold schwarzenegger.jpg|thumb|Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], with his catchphrase ''&quot;[[I'll be back]]&quot;'' written in.]]
''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1990|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot;. ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) reunited him with director [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed him in ''Twins''. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled &quot;[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Buck |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger directs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19900422&amp;id=xdIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ms4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,1660751 |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |publisher=Google News Archive |agency=Associated Press |date=April 22, 1990 |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903182833/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19900422&amp;id=xdIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ms4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,1660751 |archive-date=September 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with the 1992 [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut (1992 film)|Christmas in Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Endrst |title='Connecticut' could use more of Arnold's muscle |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19920412&amp;id=m1ZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oesDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6719,2774672 |newspaper=The Register-Guard |publisher=Google News Archive |date=April 12, 1992 |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903182833/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19920412&amp;id=m1ZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oesDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6719,2774672 |archive-date=September 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the &quot;International Star of the Decade&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[parody|spoof]] ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which went on to earn over $150&amp;nbsp;million domestically (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|150|2003|r=0|fmt=c}} million today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator3.htm |title=Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208093821/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator3.htm |archive-date=December 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall|-1|sp=us}} ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central [[Graz]]. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=September 27, 2002 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223210646/http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |archive-date=February 23, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in ''[[The Rundown]]'', and the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film ''[[The Kid &amp; I]]''. He voiced [[Baron von Steuben]] in the ''[[Liberty's Kids]]'' episode &quot;[[Valley Forge]]&quot;. He had been rumored to be appearing in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php |title=Arnold downplays a Terminator Salvation cameo |publisher=SCI FI Wire |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313234133/http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php |archivedate=March 13, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first ''Terminator'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger (Virtually) Back in Terminator Salvation |work=TV Guide |accessdate=May 8, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520083012/http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx |archivedate=May 20, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg |title=McG Talks Terminator Salvation |publisher=reelzchannel.com |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190521/http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', where he made a [[cameo appearance]].

===Return to acting===
In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama ''With Wings as Eagles'', written by [[Randall Wallace]], based on a true story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krone.at/Welt/Schwarzenegger_Ich_lese_gerade_drei_Drehbuecher-Krone-Interview-Story-240860 |title=Schwarzenegger: &quot;Ich lese gerade drei Drehbücher&quot; – &quot;Krone&quot;-Interview – Welt |publisher=krone.at |date=January 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119035212/http://www.krone.at/Welt/Schwarzenegger_Ich_lese_gerade_drei_Drehbuecher-Krone-Interview-Story-240860 |archive-date=January 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1741.html |title=Arnold's Big Comeback Film May Soar with &quot;Wings&quot;!

On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the [[Arnold Classic]], Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to ''[[The Terminator]]'' and remakes of ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', and that he was &quot;packaging&quot; a comic book character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1767.html |title=TAFs Exclusive: 15 Scripts and 1 Superhero!

In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show.

Schwarzenegger has been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for many years. When he was an  actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning community. At the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408110102/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |archivedate=April 8, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]–[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.

But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, &quot;What party is he?&quot; My friend said, &quot;He's a Republican.&quot; I said, &quot;Then I am a Republican.&quot; And I have been a Republican ever since.}}

In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in &quot;[[Stop the Madness]]&quot;, an anti-drug music video sponsored by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], accompanying then-Vice President [[George H. W.

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot;/&gt; He was nominated by [[George H. W. Bush]], who dubbed him &quot;[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Republican&quot;. He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor [[Pete Wilson]].

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a [[Red Cross]] ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio [[public service announcement]]s to donate blood.

In an interview with ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, &quot;I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside.&quot; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for [[governor of California]] Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I'm in show business&amp;nbsp;– I am in the middle of my career.

Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election]] for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the &quot;Governator&quot; (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and &quot;[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]&quot; (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election &quot;[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]&quot; (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger).

[[File:Schwarzenegger Bush.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship.]]
On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]], and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million votes. Under the regulations of the [[California Constitution]], no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor [[John G. Downey]] in 1862.

Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up [[Gridlock (politics)|political gridlock]]. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch &quot;[[Hans and Franz]]&quot; from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians &quot;[[girlie men]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFGirlieMen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=July 18, 2004 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |first=Peter |last=Nicholas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504060359/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F07%2F18%2FMNGH57NKAF1.DTL |archivedate=May 4, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a [[California special election, 2005|special election]] he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that &quot;no one could win if the opposition raised 160&amp;nbsp;million dollars to defeat you&quot;.  The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in ''[[Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/opinion-analysis-knox-knocks-unions-on-mid-year-assessment-for-non-members/ |title=Opinion analysis: Knox knocks unions on mid-year assessment for non-members |work=SCOTUSblog |date=June 25, 2012 |access-date=April 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415065401/http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/opinion-analysis-knox-knocks-unions-on-mid-year-assessment-for-non-members/ |archive-date=April 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat [[Phil Angelides]], the [[California State Treasurer]], in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 elections]], held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Election&amp;nbsp;– Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum.

Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and [[bodybuilding]] as the means to escape a depressing home.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot; /&gt; Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, &quot;I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers.

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary]] of the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]] was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Senator [[John McCain]], Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, &quot;It's Rudy's fault!&quot; (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind).

Schwarzenegger replied in 2004 that he has &quot;behaved badly sometimes&quot; and apologized, but also stated that &quot;a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true&quot;. This led to a resurfacing of an interview in adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' from 1977, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger's Sex Talk |publisher=The Smoking Gun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/schwarzeneggers-sex-talk |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |date=May 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704170517/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/schwarzeneggers-sex-talk |archive-date=July 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film ''[[Pumping Iron]].''

===Citizenship===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2004-01-30.jpg|thumb|right|Schwarzenegger in 2004]]

Schwarzenegger became a [[naturalized U.S. citizen]] on September 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[United Press International]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/us/actor-becomes-us-citizen.html |title=Actor Becomes U.S. Citizen |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 1983 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122051700/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/us/actor-becomes-us-citizen.html |archive-date=January 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his [[Austrian citizenship]], as Austria does not usually allow [[dual citizenship]]. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the [[Austrian Parliament]] from the [[Austrian Green Party]], unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of [[Donald Beardslee]] and [[Stanley Williams]]. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: &quot;A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DamageAustria&quot; /&gt; Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency if such an error had occurred.

===Environmental record===
On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]], creating the nation's first cap on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |accessdate=May 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |title=Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill |first=Samantha |last=Young |date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105054329/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]]. They plan to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html |accessdate=May 15, 2008 |publisher=Fox News Channel |title=Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight |first=Karen |last=Matthews |date=October 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525191041/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint.

===Presidential ambitions===
The [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]] in 2003 was widely accredited as the &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot; bill, which would have added an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run, as he was not a [[natural born citizen]]. In 2004, the &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot; campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Amend-for-Arnold-campaign-launched-Web-site-2635267.php &quot;'Amend for Arnold' campaign launched / Web site, TV spot promote change to Constitution&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525192620/http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Amend-for-Arnold-campaign-launched-Web-site-2635267.php |date=May 25, 2017 }}, John Wildermuth.

In October 2013, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for [[President of the United States|president]]. The former California governor would face a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] hurdle; [[Natural-born-citizen clause|Article II, Section I, Clause V]] prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional change]], or filing a legal challenge to the provision. [[Columbia University]] law professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, &quot;The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold lobbies for White House run |author=Smith, E. |url=http://pagesix.com/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-mounting-legal-challenge-to-run-for-president/ |newspaper=New York Post |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=October 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018192106/http://pagesix.com/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-mounting-legal-challenge-to-run-for-president/ |archive-date=October 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;/&gt; Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a &quot;prolific goal setter&quot; and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car&amp;nbsp;– and succeed in doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;/&gt; By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of lucrative business ventures and investments.

===Bricklaying business===
In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Millionaire Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Real Life Action Hero |work=Millionaire Magazine |url=http://www.millionaire.com/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212192915/http://www.millionaire.com/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Morgan |first=Kaya |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Working&quot; Out |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp?sec=life&amp;subsec=didyouknow |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523204758/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp%3Fsec%3Dlife%26subsec%3Ddidyouknow |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail-order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Millionaire Magazine&quot; /&gt;

===Investments===

===Restaurant===
In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in [[Santa Monica]] called ''Schatzi On Main''.

Over the years, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to [[2007 financial crisis|economic recessions]] in the U.S. and [[Eurozone crisis|Europe]] since the late 2000s.

Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot; /&gt; The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the [[Apollo 11|first Apollo Moon landing]] on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt; They shared an apartment in [[Santa Monica, California]], for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt; Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had &quot;little understanding of polite society&quot; and she found him a turn-off, she says, &quot;He's as much a [[self-made man]] as it's possible to be—he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt;

Schwarzenegger met his next lover, [[Beverly Hills]] hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an [[open relationship]]: &quot;We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger met television journalist [[Maria Shriver]], niece of President [[John F. Kennedy]], at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt;

On May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked, [[Dropkick|drop-kicked]] from behind by an unknown malefactor, while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools.

===Height===
Schwarzenegger's official height of {{cvt|6|ft|2|in}} has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be {{cvt|6|ft|1.5|in}}, a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.{{cn|date=November 2019}} However, in 1988, both the ''Daily Mail'' and ''Time Out'' magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews, N page 157&quot;&gt;Andrews, N: &quot;True Myths: The life and times of Arnold Schwarzenegger,&quot; page 157. Bloomsbury, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the ''[[Chicago Reader]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poor Recall |work=Chicago Reader |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/hottype/2003/030919_1.html |date=September 23, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Miner |first=Michael |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423133904/http://www.chicagoreader.com/hottype/2003/030919_1.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman [[Herb Wesson]] over their heights.

===Autobiography===
Schwarzenegger's autobiography, ''Total Recall'', was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called &quot;The Secret&quot; to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8829291 |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger talks scandal, new book with '60 Minutes' |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106004755/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fnational_world&amp;id=8829291 |archive-date=November 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
Growing up during the [[Allied occupation of Austria]], Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: My army tank mistake |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyw6mJhb090 |website=YouTube |language=en |access-date=May 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626192439/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyw6mJhb090 |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he had to pay $20,000 in order to bring his Austrian Army [[M47 Patton]] tank (331) to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/arnold-schwarzenegger-gives-kids-rides-in-his-old-war-tank.html|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger paid $20,000 to ship his old tank to the US and now uses it to help kids|website=cnbc.com|date=26 July 2018|access-date=October 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821234116/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/arnold-schwarzenegger-gives-kids-rides-in-his-old-war-tank.html|archive-date=August 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965.

Moreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a [[Humvee]]. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, [[AM General]], to produce a [[street-legal vehicle|street-legal]], civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two [[Hummer H1]]s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for [[hydrogen]], one for [[vegetable oil]], and one for [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hummer and Schwarzenegger: They probably won't be back |date=February 28, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022603248.html |accessdate=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102212601/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022603248.html |archive-date=November 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare [[Bugatti Veyron]] Grand Sport Vitesse.

The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large—each weighs {{convert|6300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide—that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the [[California Hydrogen Highway]] Network, and gained a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051803/http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |archivedate=March 16, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Wickell |first=Dale |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525024014/http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
