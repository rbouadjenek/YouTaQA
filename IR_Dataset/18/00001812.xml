Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos had been friends since school days and business partners in various endeavors, including a hamburger stand, an air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949, they were introduced to the Nutrilite Products Corporation&lt;ref&gt;A California-based direct sales company founded by Carl Rehnborg, the developer of the first [[multivitamin]] marketed in the United States&lt;/ref&gt; by Van Andel's second cousin Neil Maaskant. DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for [[Nutrilite]] food supplements in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Conn|first= Charles Paul|title= The Possible Dream: A Candid Look At Amway|authorlink=Charles Paul Conn|publisher=[[Revell]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-8007-0857-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. They traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar soon after, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor. They watched promotional filmstrips and listened to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, then they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop the business further.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Earlier in 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed the Ja-Ri Corporation (abbreviated from their respective first names) to import wooden goods from South American countries. After the Chicago seminar, they turned Ja-Ri into a Nutrilite distributorship instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Van Andel|first= Jay|title= An Enterprising Life|authorlink=Jay Van Andel|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-88730-997-6|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite offered [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] on sales made by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system known as [[multi-level marketing]] or network marketing. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of more than 5,000 distributors. However, they and some of their top distributors formed the American Way Association, or Amway, in April 1959 in response to concerns about the stability of Nutrilite and in order to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Robinson|first= James W.|title= Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It Means to You|publisher=[[Prima Publishing]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7615-1088-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first product was called Frisk, a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Amway bought controlling interest of Nutrilite in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahead of Its Time Health Care: Nutrilite founder worked on the first food supplements in the 1920s; the company is now owned by Amway |first=Anne |last=Michaud |newspaper=Orange County Register |page=C01 |date=December 29, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and full ownership in 1994.

===International expansion===
Amway expanded to Australia in 1971, to parts of Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to [[Thailand]] in 1987, to China in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=安利在华小心翼翼自我洗白 中国区业绩已连续3年下滑|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2018-01-26/doc-ifyqyesy2164667.shtml|website=finance.sina.com.cn|accessdate=2018-05-26|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180526060610/http://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2018-01-26/doc-ifyqyesy2164667.shtml|archivedate=May 26, 2018|language=zh-cn|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to [[Ukraine]] in 2003, to Russia in 2005{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, and to [[Vietnam]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.grbj.com/articles/73124|title=Amway Corp is World Trader of the Year again|first=Pete|last=Daly|date=April 29, 2011|website=Grand Rapids Business Journal|access-date=September 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219114654/http://www.grbj.com/articles/73124|archive-date=February 19, 2014|url-status=live|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a Russian loyalty card program called &quot;Alfa-Amway&quot; was created when Amway joined with [[Alfa-Bank]].&lt;ref name=Filkins2018.10.15&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/was-there-a-connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign |title=Was There a Connection Between a Russian Bank and the Trump Campaign?

Amway was ranked as the 42nd largest [[privately held company]] in the United States by ''Forbes'' in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/amway/?list=largest-private-companies|title=Amway on the Forbes America's Largest Private Companies List|date=October 24, 2018|work=Forbes|accessdate=September 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the number one largest company on the ''Direct Selling News'' Global 100 list in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.directsellingnews.com/global-100/|title=DSN Global 100|website=Direct Selling News|access-date=December 29, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quixtar===
{{Main|Amway Global}}
In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named [[Alticor]], and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named [[Quixtar]], [[Access Business Group]], and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by Fulton Innovation, pursued research and development and [[Access Business Group]] handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third-party clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007706130458 |title=Amway marque to be revived; Quixtar label scrapped |newspaper=The Detroit News |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference was that all &quot;Independent Business Owners&quot; (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their [[upline]] &quot;direct distributor&quot;, and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18- to 24-month period in favor of a unified Amway brand ([[Amway Global]]) worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/21/image-overhaul-rebranding-cmo-network-rebranding.html#d0f7b33788fa|title=Companies Seek A Fresh Start With New Names|last=Coster|first=Helen|date=21 August 2009|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, Quixtar published ''The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan'', in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for &quot;Active&quot; IBOs was $115.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf |title=Quixtar.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715140756/http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf| archivedate= July 15, 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global markets==
According to the Amway website, {{as of|2011|lc=y}} the company operates in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia. Amway's top ten markets are China, Korea, the United States, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, India, Russia, Malaysia and Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mibiz&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 |title=Amway Parent hits 50th year running recording 15% sales growth |agency=Reuters |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=February 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511084835/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 |archive-date=May 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amway Australia===
* See ''[[Amway Australia]]''

===Amway China===
Amway China launched in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal [[pyramid scheme]]s led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all [[direct selling]] companies, including Amway.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chinese officials ban direct marketing&quot;, April 22, 1998 [[Associated Press]], The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt; After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]], and [[Mary Kay]] continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amway, Once Barred in China, Now Finds Business is Booming|first=Leslie|last=Chang|date=March 12, 2003|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|url-access=subscription|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB104743545419760000}}&lt;/ref&gt; China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the United States, salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit.

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2&amp;nbsp;billion in annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/business/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/business-3/116693763565130.xml&amp;coll=7 &quot;Amway, Mary Kay get long-awaited direct-selling licenses in China&quot;] Rob Kirkbride, December 24, 2006, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked no. 88 by ''Forbes'' magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesWomen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/11/biz_powerwomen08_Eva-Cheng_34MT.html |title=Forbes' The 100 Most Powerful Women; No.88 Eva Cheng |work=Forbes |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of 17&amp;nbsp;billion yuan (US$2.5 billion).&lt;ref name=LevinD&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin |first=Dan |title=Amway's China Redux |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html |accessdate=17 May 2011 |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=August 27, 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829074138/http://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html |archivedate=August 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and $3&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue.&lt;ref name=EinhornB&gt;{{cite news|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|title=Why Amway and China are a Good Fit|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Businessweek]]|date=April 8, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102312/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm| archivedate= June 6, 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brands==
Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent SA8 added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line [[Artistry (cosmetics)|Artistry]] (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India and the US, as well as Nutrilite organic farms in Brazil, Mexico and the US (California and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Amway brands include Artistry, Atmosphere, Body Blends, Bodykey, Body Works, Clear Now, eSpring, Glister, iCook, Legacy of Clean, Nutrilite, Peter Island, Perfect Empowered Drinking Water, Personal Accents, Ribbon, Satinique, Artistry Men and [[XS Energy Drink|XS]].

In 2018, nutrition and wellness products were 52% of total sales, and beauty and personal care products, 26%.&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mibiz&quot;/&gt;

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, SA8 laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/cooking-cleaning/laundry-detergents-1-07/overview/0107_soap_ov.htm |title=Laundry Detergents |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consumer Reports'' did, however, criticize SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rob Kirkbride / The Grand Rapids Press|title=Amway's old reliable cleans up|publisher=Grand Rapids Press, The (MI)|page=A1 |date= December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested. ''Consumer Reports'' program manager Pat Slaven recommended against buying the products because consumers can &quot;go to the grocery store and get something that performs a whole lot better for a whole lot less money&quot;.&lt;ref name=Odonnell2011&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Donnell|first= Jayne|title=Multilevel marketing or 'pyramid?'

==Ditto Delivery==
Ditto Delivery is Alticor's automatic, monthly replenishment program that fills orders based on customers' predetermined needs. As of May 2001, Ditto Delivery accounted for 30% of Quixtar's North American sales.&lt;ref name=forbes2001&gt;{{cite news|last=Bannan|first=Karen J.|title=Amway.com |url=https://www.forbes.com/best/2001/0625/040.html |accessdate=May 17, 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|date=June 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Amway combines direct selling with a [[multi-level marketing]] strategy. Amway distributors, referred to as &quot;independent business owners&quot; (IBOs), may market products directly to potential customers and may also sponsor and mentor other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xardel&quot;/&gt; People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices. [[Harvard Business School]], which described Amway as &quot;one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world&quot;, noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos &quot;accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HarvardBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=American Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century – Richard M.

The arena, formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre, was renamed the [[Amway Arena]]. Its successor, the [[Amway Center]], was opened in 2010, and the older arena was demolished in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesh.com/news/30141458/detail.html &quot;Amway Arena To Be Imploded&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214094203/http://www.wesh.com/news/30141458/detail.html |date=February 14, 2012 }} WESH.com Orlando&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Amway signed a three-year deal to be the presenting sponsor of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Detroit Red Wings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2011/09/red_wings_sign_multi-year_deal.html|title=Red Wings sign multi-year deal with Amway as its presenting sponsor|last=Khan|first=Ansar|date=September 2, 2011|publisher=[[Booth Newspapers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political contributions===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 political campaign]] of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor [[Sue Myrick]] (N.C.).&lt;ref name=burstein&gt;{{cite web| title = She Did it Amway | author=Rachel Burstein | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = September–October 1996 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to two reports by ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager &quot;used the company's extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871&quot; to Myrick's campaign.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=zibrowski&gt;{{cite web| title = Tough sell| author=John Zibrowski, Jenna Ziman | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = Nov–Dec 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/tough-sell| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained &quot;close ties to Amway and Yager&quot;, and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, &quot;most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors&quot;, in the 1997–98 election cycle.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election, $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC), and was the number one corporate political donor in the United States.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; In the 2004 election cycle, the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative [[527 group]], [[Progress for America]].&lt;ref&gt;From opensecrets.org: [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&amp;cycle=2004&amp;format=&amp;tname=Progress+for+America Progress for America – Top Contributors, 2004 Cycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818110238/http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&amp;cycle=2004&amp;format=&amp;tname=Progress+for+America |date=August 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3&amp;nbsp;million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3&amp;nbsp;million to pay for Republican &quot;infomercials&quot; and televising of the GOP convention on [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|Family Channel]], but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vlasic | first = Bill |title = Amway II: The Kids Take Over |work=BusinessWeek |date = February 16, 1998 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-02-15/amway-ii-the-kids-take-over |accessdate=December 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sue Myrick of North Carolina, [[Jon Christensen]] of Nebraska, [[Dick Chrysler]] of Michigan, [[Richard Pombo]] of California, and [[John Ensign]] of Nevada.

[[Transaction Publishers]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, of the consulting firm Thinkalytics, LLC, reasoned that although some critics have referred to organizations such as Amway as &quot;cults&quot; and have speculated that they engage in &quot;mind control&quot;, there are other explanations that could account for the behavior of distributors. Namely, continued involvement of distributors despite minimal economic return may result from social satisfaction compensating for diminished economic satisfaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhattacharye-mehta&quot;&gt;''Socialization in network marketing organizations: is it cult behavior?'' by Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, Journal of Socio-Economics. 29(4):361–374.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a [[Chandigarh]] court framed charges, under [[Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code]] and the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, against two directors of Amway India, William Scot Pinckney and Prithvai Raj Bijlani. This was based on a cheating case filed by eight complainants in 2002, following which the Economic Offences Wing had filed chargesheet in 2012. A revision plea moved by the two Amway officials against the framed charges was dismissed in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Charges framed against two Amway directors | newspaper = The Tribune | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/mobi/news/chandigarh/courts/charges-framed-against-two-amway-directors/349309.html | location = India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chandigarh Court junks revision plea of two Amway officials in 2002 cheating case | newspaper = The Indian Express | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/2002-cheating-case-chandigarh-court-junks-revision-plea-of-two-amway-officials-5259012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. class action settlement===
On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56&amp;nbsp;million—$34&amp;nbsp;million in cash and $22&amp;nbsp;million in products—to settle a [[class action]] that had been filed in Federal District Court in California in 2007.&lt;ref name=classaction&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Knape |url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/amway_agrees_to_pay_56_million.html |title=Amway agrees to pay $56 million, settle case alleging it operates a 'pyramid scheme' |date=November 3, 2010 |website=MLive |accessdate=September 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class action, which had been brought against Quixtar and several of its top-level distributors, alleged fraud, [[racketeering]], and that the defendants operated as an illegal pyramid scheme.

The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which was expected in early 2011.&lt;ref name=classaction/&gt; The economic value of the settlement, including the changes Amway made to its business model, totals $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/lawyers_say_their_20_million_p.html |title=&quot;Lawyers say their $20 million payment is fair for $100 million settlement in Amway pyramid scheme lawsuit&quot;, ''Grand Rapids Press'' (November 4, 2010) |publisher=Mlive.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=November 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supplements were manufactured by CSA Nutraceuticals, a [[subsidiary]] of [[Alticor]]'s Access Business Group.&lt;ref name=Dembling&gt;{{cite book|author= Sophia Dembling|author2= Lisa Gutierrez|title=The Making of Dr. Phil: The Straight-Talking True Story of Everyone's Favorite Therapist|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0471696595|page=181|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC later dropped the probe, but in October 2005 a [[class-action lawsuit]] was filed against McGraw by several people who used the products and claimed that the supplements, which cost $120 per month, did not stimulate weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013055352/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 13, 2005 |title=Class-action status sought in Dr. Phil diet suit |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |publisher=CTV Globe Media |year=2005 |author=&lt;!-- CTV.ca News Staff --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, a $10.5&amp;nbsp;million settlement was reached, in which Alticor agreed to provide $4.5&amp;nbsp;million in cash and $6&amp;nbsp;million in Nutrilite products to disgruntled users of Shape Up.&lt;ref name=&quot;usaap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-26-dr-phil-diet_x.htm|title=Settlement reached on Dr. Phil diet plan|accessdate=October 21, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=Associated Press | date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casewatch.org/civil/drphil/settlement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9791 |title=News+Views: Slimming the Amway |newspaper=Metro Times Detroit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082818/http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9791|archivedate=10 October 2007|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-10-04/justice/dr.phil_1_low-calorie-diet-dieters-class-action?_s=PM:LAW | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707234202/http://articles.cnn.com/2005-10-04/justice/dr.phil_1_low-calorie-diet-dieters-class-action?_s=PM:LAW | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 7, 2012 | publisher=CNN | title=California judge gives tentative OK to Toyota class-action suit | date=November 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procter &amp; Gamble===
Some Amway distributors distributed an [[urban legend]] that the (old) [[Procter &amp; Gamble#Logo myth|Procter &amp; Gamble service mark]] was in fact a [[Satanism|Satanic]] symbol or that the CEO of P&amp;G is himself a practicing [[Satanist]]. (In some variants of the story, it is also claimed that the CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble donated &quot;satanic tithes&quot; to the [[Church of Satan]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/procter.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Procter and Gamble and Satanism Rumor |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble alleged that several Amway distributors were behind a resurgence of the story in the 1990s and sued several independent Amway distributors and the company for [[defamation]] and slander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[Procter &amp; Gamble]] v.

In October 2005 a Utah appeals court reversed part of the decision dismissing the case against the four Amway distributors, and remanded it to the lower court for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kscourts.org/CA10/cases/2005/10/03-4234.htm 03-4234 – Procter &amp; Gamble Co.

===Regulatory violations in Vietnam===
In January 2017, the Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade determined that Amway Vietnam had violated federal regulations by engaging in unauthorized multi-level marketing.&lt;ref name=&quot;VNN_011716&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Amway found violating multiple regulations on multi-level marketing|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/business/171344/amway-found-violating-multiple-regulations-on-multi-level-marketing.html|accessdate=January 19, 2017|publisher=VietnamNet Bridge|date=January 17, 2017|ref=VNN_011716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==
===Cultism===
Some Amway distributor groups have been accused of using &quot;[[cult]]-like&quot; tactics to attract new distributors and keep them involved and committed.&lt;ref name=butterfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;samways&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Samways |first=Louise |date=1994 |title=Dangerous Persuaders |location=Ringwood, Vic., Australia |publisher=Penguin |page= |isbn=9780140235531 |ol=1159413M |oclc=31288848 |lccn=94137444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hidden-persuaders&quot;&gt;&quot;Hidden persuaders&quot;, by Tony Thompson.

Routledge, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hidden-persuaders&quot;/&gt;

===''Dateline NBC''===
In 2004, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of Quixtar.&lt;ref name=&quot;DATELINE&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
  | last = Hansen
  | first = Chris
  | authorlink = Chris Hansen
  | title = In pursuit of the almighty dollar
  | work=[[Dateline NBC]]
  | publisher=[[NBC News]]
  | date = May 7, 2004
  | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4375477
  | accessdate =July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the &quot;high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar&quot; are actually &quot;making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar's cosmetics, soaps, and electronics&quot;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don't get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books, tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can't sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The program said that a Quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about Quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding [[arrest warrant]] for cocaine possession from the mid-90s.&lt;ref name=DATELINE/&gt;

In a response to the ''Dateline'' report, Quixtar published a &quot;Dateline Quixtar Response&quot; on its official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/ |title=Quixtar – Official Quixtar Company Site of Quixtar.com, Inc|accessdate=March 26, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022081856/http://www.quixtar.com/|archivedate=October 22, 2004 |website=quixtar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/ |title=Quixtar – Dateline Quixtar Response to NBC Dateline Quixtar Story|accessdate=March 26, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029002502/http://www.quixtarresponse.com/|archivedate=October 29, 2004 |website=quixtarresponse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quixtar stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We learned that two Dateline producers had registered as IBOs and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story, which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with IBOs. The producers did not identify themselves as working for Dateline, instead feigning interest in building a business powered by Quixtar.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The site also stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Dateline's story on Quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former Independent Business Owners (IBOs) – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of IBOs powered by Quixtar who are achieving their goals.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
