[[File:Diamond and graphite.jpg|thumb|193x193px|[[Diamond]] and [[graphite]] are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that differ in crystalline structure.]]

'''Allotropy''' or '''allotropism''' ({{ety|grc|''ἄλλος'' (allos)|other||''τρόπος'' (tropos)|manner, form}}) is the property of some [[chemical element]]s to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical [[State of matter|state]], known as '''allotropes''' of the elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Allotrope|file=A00243|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atom]]s of the element are [[chemical bond|bonded]] together in a different manner. For example, the [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[diamond]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[state of matter|phase]] (i.e.:  [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]] states); differences in these states alone would not constitute examples of allotropy.

For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae despite difference in phase; for example, two [[allotropes of oxygen]] ([[oxygen|dioxygen]], O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases; for example, [[phosphorus]] has [[allotropes of phosphorus|numerous solid allotropes]], which all revert to the same P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; form when melted to the liquid state.

==History==
The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779–1848).&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{citation | last = Jensen | first = W. B. | title = The Origin of the Term Allotrope | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | year = 2006 | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 838–39 | doi = 10.1021/ed083p838|bibcode = 2006JChEd..83..838J }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived {{ety|gre|''άλλοτροπἱα'' (allotropia)|variability, changeableness}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = allotropy | title = A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles | volume = 1 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1888 | page = 238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of [[Avogadro's law|Avogadro's hypothesis]] in 1860, it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; In the early 20th century, it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.

By 1912, [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]] noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, [[IUPAC]] and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2006, citing Addison, W. E. The Allotropy of the Elements (Elsevier 1964) that many have repeated this advice.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in properties of an element's allotropes==
Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]]. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure ([[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]) to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906&amp;nbsp;°C, and [[tin]] undergoes a modification known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metal]]lic form to a [[semiconductor]] form below 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C (55.8&amp;nbsp;°F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==List of allotropes==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

Typically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to [[catenation|catenate]].

== Nanoallotropes ==
In 2017, the concept of nanoallotropy was proposed by Prof. Rafal Klajn of the Organic Chemistry Department of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Udayabhaskararao|first=Thumu|last2=Altantzis|first2=Thomas|last3=Houben|first3=Lothar|last4=Coronado-Puchau|first4=Marc|last5=Langer|first5=Judith|last6=Popovitz-Biro|first6=Ronit|last7=Liz-Marzán|first7=Luis M.|last8=Vuković|first8=Lela|last9=Král|first9=Petr|date=2017-10-27|title=Tunable porous nanoallotropes prepared by post-assembly etching of binary nanoparticle superlattices|journal=Science|language=en|volume=358|issue=6362|pages=514–518|doi=10.1126/science.aan6046|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29074773|bibcode=2017Sci...358..514U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoallotropes, or allotropes of nanomaterials, are nanoporous materials that have the same chemical composition (e.g., Au), but differ in their architecture at the nanoscale (that is, on a scale 10 to 100 times the dimensions of individual atoms).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://israelbds.org/materials-that-dont-exist-in-nature-might-lead-to-new-fabrication-techniques/|title=Materials That Don't Exist in Nature Might Lead to New Fabrication Techniques|website=israelbds.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209152005/http://israelbds.org/materials-that-dont-exist-in-nature-might-lead-to-new-fabrication-techniques/|archive-date=2017-12-09|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such nanoallotropes may help create ultra-small electronic devices and find other industrial applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The different nanoscale architectures translate into different properties, as was demonstrated for [[surface-enhanced Raman scattering]] performed on several different nanoallotropes of gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; A two-step method for generating nanoallotropes was also created.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
