'''Transport in [[Belgium]]''' is facilitated with well-developed road, air, rail and water networks. The rail network has {{convert|2950|km|abbr=on}} of electrified tracks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120912132234/http://www.infrabel.be/portal/page/portal/pgr_inf2_e_internet/infrabel_short_desc/historique] &lt;/ref&gt; There are {{convert|118414|km|abbr=on}} of roads, among which there are {{convert|1747|km|abbr=on}} of motorways, {{convert|13892|km|abbr=on}} of main roads and {{convert|102775|km|abbr=on}} of other paved roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/modules/publications/statistiques/circulation_et_transport/longueur_du_reseau_routier_revetu_en_km.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514172603/http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/modules/publications/statistiques/circulation_et_transport/longueur_du_reseau_routier_revetu_en_km.jsp |archivedate=2010-05-14 }} &lt;/ref&gt; There is also a well-developed urban rail network in [[Brussels]], [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]] and [[Charleroi]]. The ports of [[port of Antwerp|Antwerp]] and [[port of Bruges-Zeebrugge|Bruges-Zeebrugge]] are two of the biggest seaports in [[Europe]]. [[Brussels Airport]] is Belgium's biggest airport.

[[File:Bruxelles-Midi 0005.jpg|thumb|280px|High-speed trains in the [[Brussels-South railway station]].]]
Rail transport in Belgium was historically managed by the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], known as SNCB in French and NMBS in Dutch. In 2005, the public company was split into 2 companies: [[Infrabel]], which manages the rail network and SNCB/NMBS itself, which manages the freight and passenger services.  There is a total of {{convert|3536|km|0}}, ({{convert|2563|km|0|abbr=on}} double track (as of 1998)), of which {{convert|2950|km|0|abbr=on}} are electrified, mainly at 3,000 volts DC but with {{convert|351|km|0|abbr=on}} at 25&amp;nbsp;kV 50&amp;nbsp;Hz AC (2004) and all on [[standard gauge]] of {{RailGauge|sg}}. In 2004 the National Railway Company of Belgium, carried 178.4 million passengers a total of 8,676 million passenger-kilometres. Due to the high population density, operations are relatively profitable, so tickets are cheap and the frequency of services is high. The SNCB/NMBS is continually updating its rolling stock.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The network currently includes [[High-speed rail in Belgium|four high speed lines]], three operating up to {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, and one up to {{convert|260|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. [[HSL 1]] runs from just south of Brussels to the French border, where it continues to [[Lille]], and from there to [[Paris]] or [[London]]. [[HSL 2]] runs from [[Leuven]] to [[Liège]]. [[HSL 3]] continues this route from Liège to the German border near [[Aachen]]. [[HSL 4]] runs from Antwerp to [[Rotterdam]] by meeting [[HSL-Zuid]] at the border with [[Netherlands]].

Electrification is at [[List of railway electrification systems|3&amp;nbsp;kV DC]], with the exception of the new high-speed lines, and of two recently electrified lines in the south of the country which are at [[List of railway electrification systems|25&amp;nbsp;kV AC]]. Trains, contrary to tram and road traffic, run on the left.

===Urban rail===
{{main|Brussels RER}}
An urban commuter rail network, Brussels RER ({{lang-fr|Réseau express régional Bruxellois}}, {{lang-nl|Gewestelijk ExpresNet}}), is currently being set up the capital. It was initially supposed to be in service in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-rail.be/projects/pages/inv07.htm|title=SNCB|website=B-rail.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some observers expect it not to be ready before 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalibre.be/economie/actualite/article/338350/pas-de-rer-a-bruxelles-avant-2016.html|title=Pas de RER à Bruxelles avant ... 2016|website=Lalibre.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metros and light rail===
{{see also|Trams in Europe}}
In Belgium an extensive system of tram-like local railways called ''[[Vicinal tramway|vicinal or buurtspoor]]'' lines crossed the country in the first half of the 20th century, and had a greater route length than the main-line [[railway]] system. The only survivors of the vicinal/buurtspoor system are the [[Belgian coast tram|Kusttram]] (covering almost the entire coast from France to the Netherlands, being the longest tram line in the world) and some sections of the [[Charleroi Pre-metro]]. Urban tram networks exist in Antwerp (the [[Antwerp Pre-metro]]), [[Ghent]] and Brussels (the [[Brussels trams]]), and are gradually being extended. The only [[rapid transit]] system in Belgium is the [[Brussels Metro]]. Some heavy [[rapid transit|metro]] infrastructures were built in Brussels, Antwerp and the Charleroi area, but these are currently used by [[light rail]] vehicles, and their conversion to full [[rapid transit|metro]] is not envisaged at present due to lack of funds.

Regional transport in Belgium is operated by regional companies: [[De Lijn]] in [[Flanders]] operates the Kusttram and the Antwerp pre-metro and tram, and the tram in Gent, as well as a bus network both urban and interurban, [[Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport|TEC]] in [[Wallonia]] operates the Charleroi pre-metro as well as a bus network and [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|MIVB/STIB]] in the [[Brussels Capital-Region]] operates the Brussels metro as well as the Brussels tram and bus network. Despite this regional organization, some bus and tram routes operated by STIB/MIVB go beyond the regional border, and some bus routes operated by TEC or De Lijn transport passengers from the Flemish or Walloon regions to the capital city or in the other regions.

==Road transport==

===Road network===
[[File:Lijn11 a12.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[A12 road (Belgium)|A12]] with a railway in the centre.]]
The road network in Belgium is managed by regional authorities, meaning that a road section in Flanders is managed by the [[Flemish Government]], a road section in Brussels by the [[Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels government]] and a road section in Wallonia by the [[Walloon Government]]. This explains that road signs in Flanders are written in Dutch, even when referring to a Walloon region, and conversely, which can be confusing for foreigners who do not know the different translations of Flemish or Walloon cities in the other language. The road network in Belgium is made of highways, national (or regional) roads (the secondary network) and communal roads (or streets). Communal roads are managed at the municipal level. There are also a number of orbital roads in Belgium around major cities.

* ''total:'' 152,256&amp;nbsp;km (2006)
* ''country comparison to the world:'' 35
* ''paved:'' 119,079&amp;nbsp;km (including 1,763&amp;nbsp;km of expressways)
* ''unpaved:'' 33,177&amp;nbsp;km

Belgian road numbering evolved during the middle decades of the twentieth century, in a relatively inconsistent way. Road number allocations became less systematic during the surge in road building that took place in the 1960s and 70s. Frequently downgraded and deteriorating older national roads retained two digit numbers while newer major roads were identified with less instantly memorable three digit numbers, if only because the shorter numbers were already taken. 1985 saw a comprehensive renumbering of the &quot;N&quot; (National) roads which now followed the scheme described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wegen-routes.be/hist/histsign.html|title=Wegen-Routes.be: Bewegwijzering en wegnummering in België|website=Wegen-routes.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Highways====
{{main|List of motorways in Belgium}}

The highways in Belgium are marked with a letter '''A''' and a number. Most often however the European numbering system for the [[international E-road network]] is used. There is however not always a one-on-one relationship between the two numbering systems along the whole length of the highways.

*[[A1 road (Belgium)|A1]] ([[European route E19|E19]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Antwerp]] - [[Breda]]
*[[A2 motorway (Belgium)|A2]] ([[European route E314|E314]]): [[Leuven]] - [[Lummen]] - [[Genk]]
*[[A3 road (Belgium)|A3]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Liège (city)|Liège]] - [[Aachen]]
*[[A4 road (Belgium)|A4]] ([[European route E411|E411]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Wavre]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Arlon]] - [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]
*[[A10 road (Belgium)|A10]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Bruges]] - [[Ostend]]
*[[A12 road (Belgium)|A12]] ([[Brussels]] - [[Boom, Antwerp|Boom]] - [[Antwerp]] - ''[[Netherlands]]'' ([[Bergen op Zoom]])&lt;br&gt;:''(includes a section not yet fully upgraded to motorway standard)''
*[[A13 road (Belgium)|A13]] ([[European route E313|E313]]): [[Antwerp]] - [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] - [[Hasselt]] - [[Liège]]
*[[A14 road (Belgium)|A14]] ([[European route E17|E17]]): [[Lille]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Antwerp]]
*[[A15 road (Belgium)|A15]] ([[European route E42|E42]]): [[Charleroi]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Huy]] - [[Liège]]
*[[A17 road (Belgium)|A17]] ([[European route E403|E403]]): [[Bruges]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Tournai]]
*[[A18 road (Belgium)|A18]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Bruges]] - [[Veurne]] - [[Dunkerque]]

====Ringways====
The ringways (or orbital roads) around bigger cities have their own series of numbers. The names start with a '''R''' then a first digit indicating the (old) province, and sometimes a second digit to further differentiate in between different ringways.

Some major examples are:
*[[R0 road (Belgium)|R0]] is the outer ringway around [[Brussels]]. The [[R20 road (Belgium)|R20]] and [[R22 road (Belgium)|R22]] are (parts of) inner ringways around Brussels.
*[[R1 ring road (Belgium)|R1]] is the southern half ringway and [[R2 road (Belgium)|R2]] is the northern half ringway around [[Antwerp]].
*[[R3 ring road (Belgium)|R3]] is the outer ringway and [[R9 road (Belgium)|R9]] is the inner ringway around [[Charleroi]]. The inner ring is counterclockwise-only.
*[[R4 road (Belgium)|R4]] is the outer ringway and [[R40 road (Belgium)|R40]] is the inner ringway around [[Ghent]].
*[[R6 road (Belgium)|R6]] is the outer ringway and [[R12 road (Belgium)|R12]] is the inner ringway around [[Mechelen]].
*[[R8 road (Belgium)|R8]] is the outer ringway and [[R36 road (Belgium)|R36]] is the inner ringway around [[Kortrijk]].
*[[R23 road (Belgium)|R23]] is the ringway around [[Leuven]].
*[[R30 road (Belgium)|R30]] is the inner ringway around [[Bruges]].

====National roads====
{{main|List of National Roads in Belgium}}
The national roads were renumbered in 1985 according to a national scheme and are identified with the letter '''N''' followed by a number.

The principal national roads fan out from Brussels, numbered in clockwise order:
*[[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Mechelen]] - [[Antwerp]]
*[[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Diest]] - [[Hasselt]] - [[Maastricht]]
*[[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Tienen]] - [[Sint-Truiden]] - [[Liège (city)|Liège]] - [[Aachen]]
*[[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Wavre]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Marche-en-Famenne]] - [[Bastogne]] - [[Arlon]]
*[[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Charleroi]] - [[Philippeville]]
*[[N6 road (Belgium)|N6]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] - [[Soignies]] - [[Mons]]
*[[N7 road (Belgium)|N7]]: [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] - [[Ath]] - [[Tournai]]
*[[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Ninove]] - [[Oudenaarde]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Ypres]] - [[Veurne]] - [[Koksijde]]
*[[N9 road (Belgium)|N9]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Eeklo]] - [[Bruges]] - [[Ostend]]

Secondary national roads intersect these.

National roads have an N plus 1, 2 or 3 digits. National roads numbered with 3 digits are provincial roads, their first number indicating the province in which the road begins:
* N1xx Province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerpen]]
* N2xx Provinces of [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]]
* N3xx Province of [[West Flanders]]
* N4xx Province of [[East Flanders]]
* N5xx Province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]]
* N6xx Province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]]
* N7xx Provinve of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]
* N8xx Province of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]]
* N9xx Province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]]

===Cars===
====Changes====
Between 1993 and 2012 the average age of the passengers cars registered as running in [[Belgium]] increased from just over 6 years and 4 months to 8 years and 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 data for other European countries are not yet available, but in 2010 the average age of car Belgium was 7.9 years against a [[European Union]] average of 8.3 years. Government policy provides an important clue as to one reason for the relative newness of the national car parc. Despite recent high-profile plant closures by [[Genk Body &amp; Assembly|Ford]] and [[Vilvoorde Renault Factory|Renault]], Belgium remains an important centre for automobile component and passenger car production, with important plants operated by [[Volvo Cars Ghent|Volvo]] and [[Audi Brussels|Audi]], and this is reflected in a relatively benign taxation environment whereby company cars are a still a popular and relatively tax efficient element in many remuneration packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Waterways===
The Belgian waterway network has 2,043&amp;nbsp;km, 1,532&amp;nbsp;km of which in regular commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilit.fgov.be/fr/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327153521/http://www.mobilit.fgov.be/fr/index.htm |archivedate=2010-03-27 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The main waterways are the [[Albert Canal]] connecting Antwerp to Liège, the [[Ghent–Terneuzen Canal]] through the port of Ghent connecting Ghent with the [[Westerschelde]], the [[Boudewijn Canal]] through the port of Bruges-Zeebrugge connecting Bruges with the [[North Sea]], the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]], [[Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal]] and [[Scheldt]] connecting Charleroi to Antwerp, the [[Nimy-Blaton-Péronnes Canal]] and Scheldt connecting the [[Borinage]] to Antwerp, the connection between the North Sea and Antwerp and the connection between [[Dunkerque]] and Liège via the Nimy-Blaton-Péronnes Canal, the [[Canal du Centre (Belgium)|Canal du Centre]], the lower [[Sambre]] and the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]. Waterways are managed on a regional level in Belgium. The region of Brussels only managed 14&amp;nbsp;km of waterways from the [[Anderlecht]] lock to the [[Vilvoorde]] bridge. In Flanders, the management of waterways is outsourced to 4 companies: NV De Scheepvaart, Département Mobiliteit en Openbare Werken, Agentschap voor Maritieme Dienstverlening en Kust and Waterwegen en Zeekanaal NV.

==Air transport==
{{main|List of airports in Belgium}}

[[File:Zaventem Brussels airport.jpg|thumb|300px|Brussels Airport is the main airport in Belgium.]]
According to the 2009 CIA World Factbook, there are a total of 43 airports in Belgium, 27 of which have paved runways. Airplane passengers in Belgium can use 5 airports, the largest of which being the [[Brussels Airport]]. The other airports are the [[Ostend-Bruges International Airport]], the [[Brussels-South Charleroi Airport]], the [[Liège Airport]] and the [[Antwerp International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/mobility/airports/|title=Airports|date=26 July 2013|website=Belgium.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other airports are military airports or small civil airports with no scheduled flights. Well-known military airports include the [[Melsbroek Air Base]] and the [[Beauvechain Air Base]]. Belgium has also 1 [[heliport]].

The Belgian national airline used to be [[Sabena]] from 1923 to 2001, until it went into bankruptcy. A new Belgian airline named [[SN Brussels Airlines]] was subsequently founded by business man [[Étienne Davignon]]. The company was then renamed as [[Brussels Airlines]] in 2006. In 2009, Brussels Airlines was taken over by German airline [[Lufthansa]].
