This is a '''list of decades''' from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC to the end of the 3rd millennium AD, including links to corresponding articles with more information about them.

{{citation needed span|During the 20th century, it became common to consider decades as historical entities in themselves&lt;!--?--&gt;. Particular trends, styles, and attitudes would be associated with and regarded as defining particular decades (which became known as &quot;[[1920s|The Twenties]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Sixties]]&quot;, and so on, though this trend had been in use since at least the late-19th Century).|date=September 2018}}
