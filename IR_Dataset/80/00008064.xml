The '''Dominican Republic''' (Spanish: ''República Dominicana'') is a country in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] that occupies the eastern five-eighths of [[Hispaniola]]. It has an area of 48,670&amp;nbsp;km², including offshore islands.

==Climate==
[[File:Dominican Republic Köppen.svg|300px|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen climate types]] of the Dominican Republic]]
The country is a [[tropical]], [[maritime nation]]. Conditions are ameliorated in many areas by elevation and by the northeast [[trade winds]], which blow steadily from the [[Atlantic]] all year long. The annual mean [[temperature]] is {{convert|25|°C}}; regional mean temperatures range from {{convert|18|°C|1}} in the heart of the Cordillera Central ([[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]]) to as high as {{convert|27|°C|1}} in arid regions. Temperatures rarely rise above {{convert|32|°C|1}}, and freezing temperatures only occur in winter in the highest mountains. The average temperature in [[Santo Domingo]] in January is {{convert|24|°C|1}}, and {{convert|27|°C|1}} in July.

The rain season for the northern coast is from November to January. For the rest of the country, the rain season is from May to November. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1346|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with extremes of {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} or more in the mountainous northeast (the windward side of the island) and {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the southwestern valleys. The western valleys, along the Haitian border, remain relatively dry, with less than {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation, due to the [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the central and northern mountain ranges. The northwestern and southeastern extremes of the country are also arid.

The Dominican Republic is occasionally damaged by tropical storms and hurricanes, which originate in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Caribbean from June until November (mainly from August to October) each year.

== Islands ==
There are several smaller islands and cays that are part of the Dominican territory. The largest islands are:
#''[[Saona Island|Saona]]'', close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 117&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=&quot;santiago&quot; /&gt; Its [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name was ''Iai'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Morales&quot;&gt;As shown in a map made by Andrés Morales in 1508 and published in 1516. ''In'' {{cite book

  | page = 88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Adamanay''. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] named this island as Savona after the Italian city of the same name but the use during years has eliminated the letter ''v''.
#''[[Beata Island|Beata]]'', in the southern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 27&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=&quot;santiago&quot; /&gt; Its [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name is unknown. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] named this island as ''Madama Beata''.
#''[[Catalina Island, Dominican Republic|Catalina]]'', very close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 9.6&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=&quot;santiago&quot; /&gt; Its [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name was ''Iabanea''&lt;ref name=&quot;Morales&quot; /&gt; but some writers, including poets, say that it was called ''Toeya'' or ''Toella''. It was visited by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] who named it ''Santa Catalina''.

== Relief ==
[[File:Cordillera Central, RD.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cordillera Central]]
The Dominican Republic is a country with many [[mountain]]s, and the highest peaks of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] are found here. The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction west–east. The mountains are separated by [[valley]]s with the same general direction.

From north to south, the mountain ranges and valleys are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Cordillera Septentrional'' (in English, &quot;Northern Range&quot;). It runs parallel to the north coast, with extensions to the northwest, the [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] Island, and to the southeast, the Samaná Peninsula (with its ''Sierra de Samaná''). Its highest mountain is [[Diego de Ocampo]], close to Santiago, with 1,249 m. There are several small plains between this range and the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers are short and most of them flow to the north.
* The ''[[Cibao]]'' Valley (Dominican Republic) is the largest and the most important valley of the country. This long valley stretches from North Haiti, where is called ''[[Plain]]e du Nord'', to Samaná Bay. It can be divided in two sections: the northwestern part is the ''Yaque del Norte Valley'' (or ''Línea Noroeste'') and the eastern ''Yuna Valley'' (or ''Vega Real'', English: ''Royal Valley''). The ''Vega Real'' is the most fertile area in the country, with a high population density.
* The ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (also called ''Sierra del Cibao'') is the island's most rugged and imposing feature and is known in Haiti as the ''Massif du Nord'' (&quot;Northern Massif&quot;).  The highest mountains of the West Indies are in this range: [[Pico Duarte]], 3,098 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range turns southward and is called ''Sierra de Ocoa'', finishing near the city of Azua de Compostela, on the Caribbean coast. Another branch, ''Cordillera Oriental'' or ''Sierra del Seibo'', is separated from the main chain by a [[Karst topography|karst]]ic region (''Los Haitises'') and with a west–east direction; it is located south of Samaná Bay.
* The ''San Juan Valley'' and ''[[Plain]] of Azua'' are big valleys south of the ''Cordillera Central'' with altitude from 0 to 600 m.
* The ''Sierra de Neiba'', with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of ''Sierra de Neiba'' is the ''Sierra Martín García'' (''Loma Busú'', 1,350 m).
* The ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' or ''Neiba Valley'' is a remarkable valley, with a west–east direction, of low altitude (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with a great salt lake: the ''[[Enriquillo Lake]]''.
* The ''Sierra de Bahoruco'', called ''Massif de la Selle'' in Haiti. This southern group of mountains have a geology very different from the rest of the island.
* ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (in English, &quot;Caribbean Coastal Plain&quot;) is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic). It is a large [[prairie]] east of [[Santo Domingo]].

# ''[[Ozama River|Ozama]]''. It is 148&amp;nbsp;km long. Its sources are in Sierra de Yamasá (a branch of the Cordillera Central). It flows into the Caribbean Sea. Its watershed has an area of 2,685&amp;nbsp;km².
# ''[[Camú River|Camú]]''. It is 137&amp;nbsp;km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows into the Yuna River. Its watershed has 2,655&amp;nbsp;km².
# ''Nizao''. It is 133&amp;nbsp;km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the south into the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Its watershed has an area of 974&amp;nbsp;km².
# ''San Juan''. It is 121&amp;nbsp;km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the south into the Yaque del Sur River. Its watershed has an area of 2,005&amp;nbsp;km².
# ''Mao''. It is 105&amp;nbsp;km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the north into the Yaque del Norte River. Its watershed has an area of 864&amp;nbsp;km².

The [[Artibonite River]] is the longest river of the island but only 68&amp;nbsp;km are in the Dominican Republic.

The largest lake of the Hispaniola, and of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], is the ''[[Lake Enriquillo]]''. It is located in the ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' with an area of 265&amp;nbsp;km². There are three small islands within the lake. It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a [[saline lake]] with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water.

Others lakes are ''Rincón'' ([[fresh water]], area of 28.2&amp;nbsp;km²), ''Oviedo'' ([[brackish]] water, area of 28&amp;nbsp;km²), ''Redonda'', ''Limón''.
