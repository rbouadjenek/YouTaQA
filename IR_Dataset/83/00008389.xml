&lt;!--Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Major depressive disorder''' ('''MDD'''), also known simply as '''depression''', is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by at least two weeks of [[depression (mood)|low mood]] that is present across most situations.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; It is often accompanied by low [[self-esteem]], [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and [[pain]] without a clear cause.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; People may also occasionally have [[delusions|false beliefs]] or [[hallucinations|see or hear things that others cannot]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Some people have [[Major depressive episode|periods of depression]] separated by years in which they are normal, while others nearly always have symptoms present.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; About 2–8% of adults with major depression die by [[suicide]],&lt;ref name=Rich2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=C.

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome can worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bair MJ, Robinson RL, Katon W, Kroenke K |title=Depression and pain comorbidity: a literature review |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=163 |issue=20 |pages=2433–45 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14609780 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.20.2433 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/20/2433(fulltext) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity.

[[Child abuse|Childhood abuse]], either physical, sexual or psychological, are all risk factors for depression, among other psychiatric issues that co-occur such as anxiety and [[drug abuse]]. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, lack of response to treatment and length of illness.

==Pathophysiology==
{{see|Biology of depression|Epigenetics of depression}}
The pathophysiology of depression is not yet understood, but the current theories center around [[monoamine]]rgic systems, the [[circadian rhythm]], immunological dysfunction, [[HPA axis]] dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.

The monoamine theory, derived from the efficacy of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, was the dominant theory until recently. The theory postulates that insufficient activity of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. Firstly, acute depletion of [[tryptophan]], a necessary precursor of [[serotonin]], a monoamine, can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of depressed patients; this suggests that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruhé HG, Mason NS, Schene AH |title=Mood is indirectly related to serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in humans: a meta-analysis of monoamine depletion studies |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=331–59 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17389902 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the [[5-HTTLPR]] gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link.

===Clinical assessment===
{{further|Rating scales for depression}}

A diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a suitably trained [[general practitioner]], or by a [[psychiatrist]] or [[psychologist]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NIMHPub&quot; /&gt; who [[psychiatric history|records]] the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, and family history. The broad clinical aim is to formulate the relevant biological, psychological, and social factors that may be impacting on the individual's mood. The assessor may also discuss the person's current ways of regulating mood (healthy or otherwise) such as alcohol and drug use. The assessment also includes a [[mental state examination]], which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or [[pessimism]], [[self-harm]] or suicide, and an absence of positive thoughts or plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIMHPub&quot; /&gt; Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas, and thus diagnosis and management is left largely to [[primary care|primary-care]] clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaufmann IM |title=Rural psychiatric services.

The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' and the [[World Health Organization]]'s ''[[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' which uses the name ''depressive episode'' for a single episode and ''recurrent depressive disorder'' for repeated episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICD-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|title=Mental and behavioural disorders: Mood [affective] disorders|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=2010|accessdate=8 November 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102133725/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|archivedate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.&lt;ref name=APA372&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both DSM-5 and ICD-10 mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSMvsICD&quot; /&gt; ICD-10 defines three typical depressive symptoms (depressed mood, [[anhedonia]], and reduced energy), two of which should be present to determine the depressive disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-10 diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|date=2010|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=12 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323025330/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|archivedate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioral disorders. Clinical description and diagnostic guideline. Geneva: World Health Organization, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; According to DSM-5, there are two main depressive symptoms- a depressed mood and loss of interest/pleasure in activities (anhedonia). These symptoms, as well as five out of the nine more specific symptoms listed, must frequently occur for more than two weeks (to the extent in which it impairs functioning) for the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psnpaloalto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Depression-Diagnostic-Criteria-and-Severity-Rating.pdf|title=Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and Depressive Episodes|website=City of Palo Alto Project Safety Net|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category [[Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified|Unspecified Depressive Disorder]] is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The ICD-10 system does not use the term ''major depressive disorder'' but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term ''recurrent'' may be added if there have been multiple episodes without [[mania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICD-10&quot; /&gt;

====Major depressive episode====
{{Main|Major depressive episode}}

A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.&lt;ref name=APA349 /&gt; Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features—commonly referred to as ''[[psychotic depression]]''—is automatically rated as severe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; If the patient has had an episode of [[mania]] or [[hypomania|markedly elevated mood]], a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] is made instead.

====Subtypes====
The DSM-5 recognizes six further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:
* &quot;[[Melancholic depression]]&quot; is characterized by [[anhedonia|a loss of pleasure in most or all activities]], a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;[[Atypical depression]]&quot; is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;[[Catatonia|Catatonic]] depression&quot; is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in [[schizophrenia]] or in manic episodes, or may be caused by [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=417–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;Depression with [[Anxiety|anxious]] distress&quot; was added into the DSM-V as a means to emphasize the common co-occurrence between depression or [[mania]] and anxiety, as well as the risk of suicide of depressed individuals with anxiety. Specifying in such a way can also help with the prognosis of those diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  
*&quot;Depression with [[Postpartum depression|peri-partum]] onset&quot; refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth or while a woman is pregnant. DSM-IV-TR used the classification &quot;postpartum depression,&quot; but this was changed in order to not exclude cases of depressed woman during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5.|author=DSM-5 Task Force|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=9780890425541|oclc=1026055291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression with peripartum onset has an incidence rate of 10–15% among new mothers. The DSM-V mandates that, in order to qualify as depression with peripartum onset, onset occur during pregnancy or within one month of delivery. It has been said that postpartum depression can last as long as three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nonacs, Ruta M |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |publisher=eMedicine |title=Postpartum depression |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013205912/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |archivedate=13 October 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;[[Seasonal affective disorder]]&quot; (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening===
In 2016, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommended screening in the adult populations with evidence that it increases the detection of people with depression and with proper treatment improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=US2016/&gt; They recommend screening in those between the age of 12 to 18 as well.&lt;ref name=US2016Peds/&gt;

A Cochrane review from 2005 found [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] programs do not significantly improve detection rates, treatment, or outcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gil2005&quot;/&gt;

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Main|Depression (differential diagnoses)}}

To confirm major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other [[Differential diagnosis|potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or bipolar disorder. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''[[double depression]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;harvnb&quot; /&gt; [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychiatric355&quot; /&gt; [[Bipolar disorder]], also known as ''manic–depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of [[mania]] or [[hypomania]]. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further differential diagnoses involve [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawk C, Jason LA, Torres-Harding S |title=Differential diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and major depressive disorder |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=244–51 |date=1 January 2006 |pmid=17078775 |doi=10.1207/s15327558ijbm1303_8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.574.3376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, [[medications]], and [[substance abuse]]. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a [[Mood disorder#Due to another medical condition|mood disorder due to a general medical condition]]. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or [[physical examination]]. When the depression is caused by a medication, drug of abuse, or exposure to a [[toxin]], it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called ''substance-induced mood disorder'' in the DSM-IV-TR).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM5&quot;/&gt;

==Prevention==
Preventive efforts may result in decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%.&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2008 /&gt; Eating large amounts of fish may also reduce the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li F, Liu X, Zhang D |title=Fish consumption and risk of depression: a meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=299–304 |date=March 2016 |pmid=26359502 |doi=10.1136/jech-2015-206278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported [[Churn rate|attrition rates]], and had a well-defined intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Jané-Llopis E, Hosman C, Jenkins R, Anderson P |year=2003 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |title=Predictors of efficacy in depression prevention programmes |website=British Journal of Psychiatry |accessdate=2 April 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083702/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the &quot;Coping with Depression&quot; course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.&lt;ref name=Munoz2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuijpers P, Muñoz RF, Clarke GN, Lewinsohn PM |title=Psychoeducational treatment and prevention of depression: the &quot;Coping with Depression&quot; course thirty years later |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=449–58 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19450912 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Management of depression}}
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the [[risk-benefit ratio]] is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

:* People with a history of moderate or severe depression
:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of [[relapse]], and that [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] are better tolerated than [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=December 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archivedate=15 November 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) or [[light therapy]]. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.&lt;ref name=apaguidelines/&gt; There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archer J, Bower P, Gilbody S, Lovell K, Richards D, Gask L, Dickens C, Coventry P | title = Collaborative care for depression and anxiety problems | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | page = CD006525 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23076925 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006525.pub2 | hdl = 10871/13751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.&lt;ref name=Patel04&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel V, Araya R, Bolton P |title=Treating depression in the developing world |journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=539–41 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15117296 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01243.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox GR, Callahan P, Churchill R, Hunot V, Merry SN, Parker AG, Hetrick SE |title=Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=CD008324 |date=November 2014 |pmid=25433518 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008324.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small amount of evidence that skipping a night's sleep may improve depressive symptoms, with the effects usually showing up within a day. This effect is usually temporary.

===Talking therapies===
[[Talking therapy]] (psychotherapy) can be delivered to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals.

====Cognitive behavioral therapy====
{{See also|Behavioral theories of depression}}
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression.&lt;ref name=abct&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726055131/http://www.abct.org/sccap/?m=sPublic&amp;fa=pub_Depression Childhood Depression]. abct.org.

The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. Research beginning in the mid-1990s suggested that CBT could perform as well as or better than antidepressants in patients with moderate to severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dobson KS |title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of cognitive therapy for depression |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=414–19 |date=June 1989 |pmid=2738214 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.57.3.414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RothFonagy78&gt;{{cite book |title=What Works for Whom?

Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being [[rational emotive behavior therapy]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb |Beck|1987|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18085916&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coelho HF, Canter PH, Ernst E |title=Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: evaluating current evidence and informing future research |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1000–05 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18085916 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.75.6.1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms.&lt;ref name=Khoury&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khoury B, Lecomte T, Fortin G, Masse M, Therien P, Bouchard V, Chapleau MA, Paquin K, Hofmann SG |title=Mindfulness-based therapy: a comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=763–71 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23796855 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jain&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain FA, Walsh RN, Eisendrath SJ, Christensen S, Rael Cahn B |title=Critical analysis of the efficacy of meditation therapies for acute and subacute phase treatment of depressive disorders: a systematic review |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=140–52 |date=2014 |pmid=25591492 |pmc=4383597 |doi=10.1016/j.psym.2014.10.007 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0372c9xp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth.&lt;ref name=Simkin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simkin DR, Black NB |title=Meditation and mindfulness in clinical practice |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=487–534 |date=July 2014 |pmid=24975623 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2014.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
[[Psychoanalysis]] is a school of thought, founded by [[Sigmund Freud]], which emphasizes the resolution of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] mental conflicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-314-20412-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Dworetzky J |title=Psychology |publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub.

===Antidepressants===
[[File:Zoloft bottles.jpg|thumb|[[Sertraline]] (Zoloft) is used primarily to treat major depression in adults.]]
Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iglesias-González M, Aznar-Lou I, Gil-Girbau M, Moreno-Peral P, Peñarrubia-María MT, Rubio-Valera M, Serrano-Blanco A | title = Comparing watchful waiting with antidepressants for the management of subclinical depression symptoms to mild-moderate depression in primary care: a systematic review | journal = Family Practice | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 639–48 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28985309 | doi = 10.1093/fampra/cmx054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic ([[dysthymia]]) or severe.

While small benefits were found, researchers [[Irving Kirsch]] and [[Thomas Moore (spiritual writer)|Thomas Moore]] state they may be due to issues with the trials rather than a true effect of the medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;administration2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |vauthors=Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment |year=2002 |volume=5 |doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for [[clinical significance]].&lt;ref name=Kir2008 /&gt; Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis by Fornier.&lt;ref name=Fou2010 /&gt;

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), such as [[escitalopram]], [[paroxetine]], and [[sertraline]], have greater efficacy than [[placebo]] on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Depression in Adults&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The treatment and management of depression in adults|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/resources/guidance-depression-in-adults-pdf|publisher=[[NICE]]|date=October 2009|accessdate=12 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112140520/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/resources/guidance-depression-in-adults-pdf|archivedate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic [[tricyclic antidepressant]] [[amitriptyline]] concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leucht C, Huhn M, Leucht S |title=Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=12 |pages=CD009138 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23235671 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 |editor1-last=Leucht |editor1-first=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.&lt;ref name=Fou2010 /&gt;

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50–75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to improvement.&lt;ref name=apaguidelines /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Vries YA, Roest AM, Bos EH, Burgerhof JG, van Loo HM, de Jonge P | title = Predicting antidepressant response by monitoring early improvement of individual symptoms of depression: individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 214 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–10 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 29952277 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.2018.122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,&lt;!--This study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?--&gt;&lt;ref name=apaguidelines&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (revision).

These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hippocrates pushkin02.jpg|alt=|thumb|Diagnoses of depression go back at least as far as [[Hippocrates]]]]
{{Main|History of depression}}

The Ancient Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] described a syndrome of melancholia as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all &quot;fears and despondencies, if they last a long time&quot; as being symptomatic of the ailment.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23&lt;/ref&gt; It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radden2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Radden J |year=2003 |title=Is this dame melancholy? Equating today's depression and past melancholia |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–52 |doi=10.1353/ppp.2003.0081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''depression'' itself was derived from the Latin verb ''deprimere'', &quot;to press down&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;depress. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved 30 June 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203095346/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century, &quot;to depress&quot; meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author [[Richard Baker (chronicler)|Richard Baker's]] ''Chronicle'' to refer to someone having &quot;a great depression of spirit&quot;, and by English author [[Samuel Johnson]] in a similar sense in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Wolpert L|year=1999|title=Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression|website=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|accessdate=30 October 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409111218/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|archivedate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also came into use in [[depression (physiology)|physiology]] and [[depression (economics)|economics]]. An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist [[Louis Delasiauve]] in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3074848&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berrios GE |title=Melancholia and depression during the 19th century: a conceptual history |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=298–304 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3074848 |doi=10.1192/bjp.153.3.298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aristotle]], melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity. The newer concept abandoned these associations and through the 19th century, became more associated with women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radden2003&quot; /&gt;

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davison2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]].

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schildkraut JJ |title=The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=509–22 |date=November 1965 |pmid=5319766 |doi=10.1176/ajp.122.5.509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical imbalance theory has never been proven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paris J |title=The mistreatment of major depressive disorder |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=148–51 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24881163 |pmc=4079242 |doi=10.1177/070674371405900306 |type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term &quot;depression&quot; is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other [[mood disorder]]s or simply to a low mood. People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. &quot;Because of the lack of scientific certainty,&quot; one commentator has observed, &quot;the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129377|title=The Depression Wars: Would Honest Abe Have Written the Gettysburg Address on Prozac?|author=Maloney F|date=3 November 2005|journal=Slate|accessdate=3 October 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925012423/http://www.slate.com/id/2129377/|archivedate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karasz05&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karasz A |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15652693 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Tilbury F, Rapley M | year = 2004 | title = 'There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=54–64|doi=10.5172/hesr.13.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as China. It has been argued that the Chinese traditionally deny or [[Somatization|somatize]] emotional depression (although since the early 1980s, the Chinese denial of depression may have modified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker G, Gladstone G, Chee KT |title=Depression in the planet's largest ethnic group: the Chinese |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=857–64 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11384889 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.6.857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status. Australian professor [[Gordon Parker (psychiatrist)|Gordon Parker]] and others have argued that the Western concept of depression &quot;medicalizes&quot; sadness or misery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker07&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker G |title=Is depression overdiagnosed?

===Stigma===
Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings, or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression.

Trials are looking at the effects of [[botulinum toxin]]s on depression. The idea is that the drug is used to make the person look less frowning and that this stops the negative [[Facial feedback hypothesis|facial feedback]] from the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruger TH, Wollmer MA |title=Depression—An emerging indication for botulinum toxin treatment |journal=Toxicon |volume=107 |issue=Pt A |pages=154–157 |date=2015 |pmid=26415901 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.09.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 results showed, however, that the partly positive effects that had been observed until then could have been due to [[placebo]] effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID25941497&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milev R |title=Response of depression to botulinum toxin treatment: agitation as a predictor |journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry |volume=6 |page=55 |year=2015 |pmid=25941497 |pmc=4403301 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00055 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018-2019, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) granted [[Breakthrough therapy designation]] to Compass Pathways and, separately, Usona Institute. Compass is a for-profit company studying [[psilocybin]] for treatment-resistant depression; Usona is a non-profit organization studying psilocybin for major depressive disorder more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://compasspathways.com/compass-pathways-receives-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-psilocybin-therapy-for-treatment-resistant-depression/|title=COMPASS Pathways Receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Psilocybin Therapy for Treatment-resistant Depression – COMPASS|language=en-US|access-date=11 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005452/en/FDA-grants-Breakthrough-Therapy-Designation-Usona-Institutes|title=FDA grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Usona Institute's psilocybin program for major depressive disorder|date=2019-11-22|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of depression in animals for the purpose of study include [[iatrogenic]] depression models (such as drug-induced), forced swim tests, [[tail suspension test]], and [[learned helplessness]] models. Criteria frequently used to assess depression in animals include expression of despair, neurovegetative changes, and anhedonia, as many other criteria for depression are untestable in animals, such as guilt and suicidality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Krishnan V, Nestler EJ |volume=7 |pages=121–47 |date=2011 |pmid=21225412 |pmc=3270071 |doi=10.1007/7854_2010_108 |isbn=978-3-642-19702-4 |series=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences |title=Molecular and Functional Models in Neuropsychiatry |chapter=Animal Models of Depression: Molecular Perspectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;
