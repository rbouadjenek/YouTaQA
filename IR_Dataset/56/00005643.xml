The '''Channel Islands''' ([[Norman language|Norman]]: ''Îles d'la Manche''; [[French language|French]]: ''Îles Anglo-Normandes'' or ''Îles de la Manche''){{refn|group=note|The term ''Îles de la Manche'' is the official French appellation in the islands themselves, whereas in [[France]] the usual term is ''Îles Anglo-Normandes''.}} are an [[archipelago]] in the [[English Channel]], off the French coast of [[Normandy]]. They include two [[Crown dependencies]]: the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]], which is the largest of the islands; and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], consisting of [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], [[Sark]], [[Herm]] and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and, although they are not part of the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx |title=Royal.gov.uk |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=4 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921052748/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx |archivedate=21 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ministry of Justice|title=Fact sheet on the UK's relationship with the Crown Dependencies|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/361537/crown-dependencies.pdf|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=14 February 2016|quote=HM Government is responsible for the defence and international relations of the Islands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown dependencies are not members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] nor of the [[European Union]]. They have a total population of about {{UN_Population|Channel Islands}}, and the bailiwicks' [[Capital city|capitals]], [[Saint Helier]] and [[Saint Peter Port]], have populations of 33,500 and 18,207, respectively.

&quot;Channel Islands&quot; is a geographical term, not a political unit. The two bailiwicks have been administered separately since the late 13th century. Each has its own independent laws, elections, and representative bodies (although in modern times, politicians from the islands' legislatures are in regular contact). Any institution common to both is the exception rather than the rule. The Bailiwick of Guernsey is divided into three jurisdictions – Guernsey, Alderney and Sark – each with its own [[legislature]]. Although there are a few pan-island institutions (such as the Channel Islands office to the EU in Brussels, which is actually a joint venture between the bailiwicks), these tend to be established structurally as equal projects between Guernsey and Jersey. Otherwise, entities proclaiming membership of both Guernsey and Jersey might in fact be from one bailiwick only, for instance the [[Channel Islands Securities Exchange]] is in Saint Peter Port (and therefore Guernsey).

The term &quot;Channel Islands&quot; began to be used around 1830, possibly first by the [[Royal Navy]] as a collective name for the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATMS&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Richard |title=At their Majesties' Service |publisher=Gateway Publishing |isbn= 9781902471129 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}} The term refers only the archipelago to the west of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. The [[Isle of Wight]], for example, is not a &quot;Channel Island&quot;, despite being located in the Channel.

== Geography ==
[[File:Channel_Islands.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The Channel Islands and adjacent coast of France]]

The two major islands are Jersey and Guernsey. They make up 99% of the population and 92% of the area.

===List of islands===
{{Also|List of islands of the Bailiwick of Guernsey}}
The permanently inhabited islands of the Channel Islands and their population and area are:
* [[Jersey]] 100,080 (118&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Guernsey]] 63,026 (65&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Alderney]] 2,000 (8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Sark]] 600 (5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Herm]] 60 (2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Jethou]] 3 (0.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Brecqhou]] (Brechou) (0.3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

There are also several uninhabited islets. Four are part of the Bailiwick of Jersey:
* The [[Minquiers]]
* [[Écréhous]]
* [[Les Dirouilles]]
* Les [[Pierres de Lecq]] (the Paternosters)

These lie off Alderney:

* [[Burhou]]
* [[Casquets]]
* [[Ortac]]
* Renonquet

These lie off Guernsey:
* [[Caquorobert]]
* [[Crevichon]]
* Grande Amfroque
* [[Houmets|Les Houmets]]
* [[Lihou]] (occupied for part of the year)

===Names===

The names of the larger islands in the archipelago in general have the ''-ey'' suffix, whilst those of the smaller ones have the ''[[-hou]]'' suffix. These are believed to be from the [[Old Norse]] ''ey'' (island) and ''holmr'' (islet).

===The Chausey Islands===

The [[Chausey]] Islands south of Jersey are not generally included in the geographical definition of the Channel Islands but are occasionally described in English as 'French Channel Islands' in view of their French jurisdiction. They were historically linked to the Duchy of Normandy, but they are part of the French territory along with continental Normandy, and not part of the [[British Isles]] or of the Channel Islands in a political sense. They are an incorporated part of the commune of Granville ([[Manche]]). While they are popular with visitors from France, Channel Islanders rarely visit them as there are no direct transport links from the other islands.

In official [[Jersey Legal French|Jersey French]], the islands are called 'Îles de la Manche', while in France, the term 'Îles Anglo-normandes' (Anglo-Norman isles) is used to refer to the British 'Channel Islands' in contrast to other islands in the Channel. Chausey is referred to as an 'Île normande' (as opposed to ''anglo-normande''). 'Îles Normandes' and 'Archipel Normand' have also, historically, been used in Channel Island French to refer to the islands as a whole.

===Waters===
The very large tidal variation provides an environmentally rich inter-tidal zone around the islands, and some islands such as [[Burhou]], the [[Écréhous]], and the [[Minquiers]] have been designated [[Ramsar sites]].

The waters around the islands include the following:

* [[The Swinge]] (between Alderney and Burhou)
* The Little Swinge (between Burhou and Les Nannels)
* La Déroute (between Jersey and Sark, and Jersey and the Cotentin)
* Le Raz Blanchard, or [[Alderney Race|Race of Alderney]] (between Alderney and the Cotentin)
* The [[Great Russel]] (between Sark, Jéthou and Herm)
* The [[Little Russel]] (between Guernsey, Herm and Jéthou)
* Souachehouais (between Le Rigdon and L'Étacq, Jersey)
* Le Gouliot (between Sark and Brecqhou)
* La Percée (between Herm and Jéthou)

===Highest point===
The highest point in the islands is [[Les Platons]] in Jersey at 143 metres (469&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest point is the English Channel (sea level).

{{Main|History of Jersey|History of Guernsey|German occupation of the Channel Islands}}
[[File:La Gran'mère du Chimquière Guernsey.jpg|thumb|''La Gran'mère du Chimquière'', [[Statue menhir]], [[Saint Martin, Guernsey]]|upright]]

===Prehistory===
The earliest evidence of human occupation of the Channel Islands has been dated to 250,000 years ago when they were attached to the landmass of continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/island-life/history-heritage/la-cotte/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands became detached by rising sea levels in the Neolithic period. The numerous [[dolmen]]s and other archaeological sites extant and recorded in history demonstrate the existence of a population large enough and organised enough to undertake constructions of considerable size and sophistication, such as the burial mound at [[La Hougue Bie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/la-hougue-bie/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Jersey or the [[statue menhir]]s of Guernsey.

===From the Iron Age===

Hoards of [[Armorica]]n coins have been excavated, providing evidence of trade and contact in the [[Iron Age]] period. Evidence for Roman settlement is sparse, although evidently the islands were visited by Roman officials and traders. The Roman name for the Channel Islands was ''I. Lenuri'' (Lenur Islands) and is included in the [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Peutinger Table]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GRTV&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rule |first=Margaret |title=A Gallo-Roman Trading Vessel from Guernsey |publisher=Guernsey Museums &amp; Galleries |isbn=978-1871560039|year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} The traditional Latin names used for the islands (Caesarea for Jersey, Sarnia for Guernsey, Riduna for Alderney) derive (possibly mistakenly) from the [[Antonine Itinerary]]. Gallo-Roman culture was adopted to an unknown extent in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century, Christian missionaries visited the islands. [[Samson of Dol]], [[Helier]], [[Marculf]] and [[Magloire]] are among saints associated with the islands. In the sixth century, they were already included in the [[diocese of Coutances]] where they remained until reformation.

There were probably some [[Celtic Britons]] who settled on the Islands in the 5th and 6th centuries AD (the indigenous Celts of [[Great Britain]], and the ancestors of the modern [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Cornish people|Cornish]], and [[Breton people|Bretons]]) who had emigrated from Great Britain in the face of invading [[Anglo-Saxons]]. But there were not enough of them to leave any trace and the islands continued to be ruled by the king of the Franks and its church remained part of the [[Coutances]] bishopric.

From the beginning of the ninth century, [[Vikings|Norse]] [[Viking expansion|raiders]] appeared on the coasts. Norse settlement eventually succeeded initial attacks, and it is from this period that many place names of Norse origin appear, including the modern names of the islands.

===From the Duchy of Normandy===
In 933, the islands were granted to [[William I Longsword]] by [[Rudolph of France|Raoul]] [[List of French monarchs#Carolingian Dynasty (752–987)|King of Western Francia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stapleton |first=Thomas |title=Magni rotuli scaccarii Normanniæ sub regibus Angliæ |date=1840 |page=lii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annexed to the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. In 1066, [[William I of England|William II of Normandy]] invaded and conquered England, becoming William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. In the period 1204–1214, [[John of England|King John]] lost the [[Angevin lands]] in northern France, including mainland Normandy, to [[Philip II of France|King Philip II of France]], but managed to retain control of the Channel Islands. In 1259, his successor, [[Henry III of England]], by the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]], officially surrendered his claim and title to the Duchy of Normandy, while the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands, which was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. Since then, the Channel Islands have been governed as possessions of [[the Crown]] and were never absorbed into the [[Kingdom of England]] and its successor kingdoms of Great Britain and the United Kingdom.

The islands were invaded by the French in 1338, who held some territory until 1345. [[Edward III of England]] granted a Charter in July 1341 to Jersey, Guernsey, Sark and Alderney, confirming their customs and laws to secure allegiance to the English Crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charters&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Thornton |first=Tim |title=The Charters of Guernsey |publisher=Woodfield Publishing |date=2004 |isbn=978-1903953655}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–4}} [[Owain Lawgoch]], a mercenary leader of a [[Free Company]] in the service of the French Crown, attacked Jersey and Guernsey in 1372, and in 1373 [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] besieged [[Mont Orgueil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/bertrand-du-guesclin/ Bertrand du Guesclin: The Black Dog of Brittany] Thisisjersey.com, copyright 2010, accessed 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The young King [[Richard II of England]] reconfirmed in 1378 the Charter rights granted by his grandfather, followed in 1394 with a second Charter granting, because of great loyalty shown to the Crown, exemption for ever, from English tolls, customs and duties.&lt;ref name=Charters/&gt;{{rp|5–10}} Jersey was occupied by the French in 1461 as part of an exchange of helping the Lancastrians fight against the Yorkists during [[The War of the Roses]]. It was retaken by the Yorkists in 1468. In 1483 a [[Papal bull]] decreed that the islands would be neutral during time of war. This privilege of neutrality enabled islanders to trade with both France and England and was respected until 1689 when it was abolished by [[Order in Council]] following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in Great Britain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Various attempts to transfer the islands from the diocese of Coutances (to Nantes (1400), Salisbury (1496), and Winchester (1499)) had little effect until an Order in Council of 1569 brought the islands formally into the [[diocese of Winchester]]. Control by the bishop of Winchester was ineffectual as the islands had turned overwhelmingly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and the episcopacy was not restored until 1620 in Jersey and 1663 in Guernsey.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Sark in the 16th century was uninhabited until colonised from Jersey in the 1560s. The grant of [[seigneur]]ship from [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1565 forms the basis of Sark's constitution today.

===From the seventeenth century===
{{main|Channel Islands in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}
During the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Jersey held out strongly for the Royalist cause, providing refuge for [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1646 and 1649–1650, while the more strongly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Guernsey more generally favoured the parliamentary cause (although [[Castle Cornet]] was held by Royalists and did not surrender until October 1651).{{sfn|Lemprière|1970|p={{page needed|date=December 2015}} }}{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=226}}{{sfn|Ellis|1937}}

The islands acquired commercial and political interests in the North American colonies. Islanders became involved with the [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fisheries in the seventeenth century. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave [[George Carteret]], Bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he promptly named [[New Jersey]], now part of the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} [[Edmund Andros|Sir Edmund Andros]] of Guernsey was an early colonial governor in North America, and head of the short-lived [[Dominion of New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir Edmund Andros |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edmund-Andros |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth century, the Islands were dubbed &quot;the French Isles&quot;. Wealthy French émigrés fleeing the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] sought residency in the islands. Many of the town domiciles existing today were built in that time. In [[Saint Peter Port]], a large part of the harbour had been built by 1865.

===20th century===

====World War II====
{{main|German occupation of the Channel Islands}}
[[File:VEGA Royal Square Jersey.jpg|thumb|During the German occupation of [[Jersey]], a stonemason repairing the paving of the Royal Square incorporated a [[V sign#Second World War: V for Victory campaign|V for victory]] under the noses of the occupiers. This was later amended to refer to the Red Cross ship ''Vega''. The addition of the date 1945 and a more recent frame has transformed it into a monument.]]

The islands were the only part of the [[British Isles]] to be occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] during [[World War II]].

The [[British Government]] demilitarised the islands in June 1940, and the lieutenant-governors were withdrawn on 21 June, leaving the insular administrations to continue government as best they could under impending military occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt;

Before German troops landed, between 30 June and 4 July 1940, evacuation took place. Many young men had already left to join the Allied armed forces, as volunteers. 6,600 out of 50,000 left Jersey while 17,000 out of 42,000 left Guernsey.&lt;ref name=&quot;guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com/evacuation/ |title=Guernsey Evacuees Oral History |publisher=Guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of children were evacuated with their schools to [[England]] and [[Scotland]].

[[File:Channel Islands Liberated- the End of German Occupation, Channel Islands, UK, 1945 D24599.jpg|thumb|upright|Crowds cheer as the Channel Islands are liberated at [[Saint Peter Port]] in 1945]]

The population of Sark largely remained where they were;&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt; but in [[Alderney#History|Alderney]], the entire population, save for six persons, left. In Alderney, the occupying Germans built [[Alderney camps|four camps]] in which over 700 people out of a total worker population of about 6,000 died. Due to the destruction of documents, it is impossible to state how many forced workers died in the other islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt; Alderney had the only Nazi concentration camps on [[British Islands|British]] soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;okeefe&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine O'Keefe |url=http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html |title=Appendix F: Concentration Camps: Endlösung – The Final Solution |accessdate=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aurigny&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Matisson Consultants |url=http://www.matisson-consultants.com/affaire-papon/aurigny.htm |title=Aurigny ; un camp de concentration nazi sur une île anglo-normande (English: Alderney, a Nazi concentration camp on an island Anglo-Norman) |accessdate=6 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220101021/http://www.matisson-consultants.com/affaire-papon/aurigny.htm |archive-date=20 February 2014 |url-status=dead }} {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Navy]] [[blockade]]d the islands from time to time, particularly following the [[Invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. There was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation, particularly in the final months when the population was close to starvation. Intense negotiations resulted in some humanitarian aid being sent via the [[Red Cross]], leading to the arrival of [[Red Cross parcel]]s in the supply ship [[SS Vega (1913)|SS Vega]] in December 1944.

The German occupation of 1940–45 was harsh: over 2,000 Islanders were deported by the Germans,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot;&gt;''The German Occupation of the Channel Islands'', Cruikshank, Oxford 1975 {{ISBN|0-19-285087-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; some Jews were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]; [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]] resistance and retribution, accusations of [[collaborationism|collaboration]], and slave labour also occurred. Many Spaniards, initially refugees from the [[Spanish Civil War]], were brought to the islands to build [[fortification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/german-occupation Thisisjersey.com]/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ginns /&gt; Later, [[Russia]]ns and [[Central Europe]]ans {{who|date=April 2015}} continued the work.&lt;ref name=Ginns&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginns|first=Michael|title=Jersey Occupied: The German Armed Forces in Jersey 1940–1945|year=2009|publisher=Channel Island Publishing|isbn=978-1905095292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[land mine]]s were laid, with 65,718 land mines laid in Jersey alone.&lt;ref&gt;''German Fortifications in Jersey'', Ginns &amp; Bryans, Jersey 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no [[resistance movement]] in the Channel Islands on the scale of that in [[French Resistance|mainland France]]. This has been ascribed to a range of factors including the physical separation of the Islands, the density of troops (up to one German for every two Islanders), the small size of the Islands precluding any hiding places for [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] groups, and the absence of the [[Gestapo]] from the occupying forces. Moreover, much of the population of military age had joined the British Army already.

The end of the occupation came after [[VE-Day]] on 8 May 1945, Jersey and Guernsey being liberated on 9 May. The German garrison in Alderney was left until 16 May, and it was one of the last of the [[Nazi German]] remnants to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;dday&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Legacy Publishers |title=Nazi Germany Surrenders: February 1945 – May 1945 |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/nazi-germany-surrenders12.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first evacuees returned on the first sailing from Great Britain on 23 June,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOotCI&quot; /&gt; but the people of Alderney were unable to start returning until December 1945. Many of the evacuees who returned home had difficulty reconnecting with their families after five years of separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com&quot;/&gt;

====Post-1945====
Following the liberation of 1945, reconstruction led to a transformation of the economies of the islands, attracting immigration and developing tourism. The legislatures were reformed and non-party governments embarked on social programmes, aided by the incomes from [[offshore finance]], which grew rapidly from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/finance-industry/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands decided not to join the [[European Economic Community]] when the UK joined, and remain outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/ChiefMinister/International%2BRelations/Profile%2Bof%2BJersey.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829124301/http://www.gov.je/ChiefMinister/International%2BRelations/Profile%2Bof%2BJersey.htm |archive-date=29 August 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, declining profitability of agriculture and tourism has challenged the governments of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/lifestyle/hanging-on-to-our-heritage/the-bailiwick-of-guernsey/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisguernsey.com |date=9 May 1945 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Channel Islands fall into two separate [[federacy|self-governing]] bailiwicks, the Bailiwick of [[Guernsey]] and the Bailiwick of [[Jersey]]. Both are [[British Empire|British]] [[Crown dependencies]], and neither is part of the United Kingdom. They have been part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] since the tenth century, and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is often referred to by her traditional and conventional title of [[Duke of Normandy]].

A bailiwick is a territory administered by a bailiff. Although the words derive from a common root ('bail' = 'to give charge of') there is a vast difference between the meaning of the word 'bailiff' (English) and 'Bailiff' (CI). (The former is a court-appointed private debt-collector authorised to collect judgment debts, while the latter is the most important citizen within his Bailiwick.) The [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] in each bailiwick is the civil head, presiding officer of the States, and also head of the [[judiciary]].

In the early part of the twenty-first century, the existence of governmental offices such as the bailiffs' which incorporate multiple roles straddling the different branches of Government came under increased scrutiny for their apparent contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers—most notably in the Guernsey case of ''McGonnell -v- United Kingdom'' (2000) 30 EHRR 289, which following final judgement at the European Court of Human Rights became part of the impetus for much recent constitutional change, particularly the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (2005 c.4) in the UK itself, including the separation of the roles of the Lord Chancellor, the abolition of the House of Lords' judicial role, and its replacement by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]]. The Islands' bailiffs, however, still retain their historic roles.

The systems of government in the Islands date from [[Normans|Norman]] times, which accounts for the names of the legislatures, the States, derived from the [[Norman language|Norman]] 'États' or '[[Estates of the realm|estates]]' (i.e. the Crown, the Church, and the people). The States have evolved over the centuries into democratic parliaments.

[[File:States Chamber public entrance Jersey.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the public gallery of the States Chamber in Jersey]]

The UK Parliament has power to legislate for the Islands, but Acts of Parliament do not extend to the Islands automatically. Usually, the Act gives power to extend the application of the Act to the Islands by an Order in Council, after consultation.  For the most part the Islands legislate for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;UK Supreme Court, R (on the application of Barclay and another) v. Secretary of State for Justice [2014] UKSC 54 [http://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2013_0155_PressSummary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Each island has its own primary legislature, known as the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[States of Jersey]], with Chief Pleas in Sark and the [[States of Alderney]] – the Channel Islands are not represented in the [[UK Parliament]]. Laws passed by the States are given [[royal assent]] by [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|The Queen in Council]], to whom the islands' governments are responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/crown/bg-info-crown-dependencies.pdf |title=Background briefing on the Crown Dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands, are not part of the [[European Union]] and, thus, were not a party to the 2016 [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on the [[European Union|EU]] membership, but were part of the Customs Territory of the [[European Community]] by virtue of Protocol Three to the [[Treaty on European Union]]. In September 2010, a Channel Islands Brussels Office was set up jointly by the two Bailiwicks to develop the Channel Islands' influence with the EU, to advise the Channel Islands' governments on European matters, and to promote economic links with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/ID%20InternationalInsight%2020101118%20JN.pdf |title=Guernsey and Jersey begin recruiting for senior Brussels positions |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both bailiwicks are members of the [[British–Irish Council]], and [[Jèrriais]] and [[Guernésiais]] are recognised [[regional language]]s of the Isles.

The legal courts are separate; separate courts of appeal have been in place since 1961. Among the legal heritage from Norman law is the [[Clameur de haro]].  The basis of the legal systems of both Bailiwicks is Norman customary law ([[Coutume]]) rather than the English [[Common Law]], although elements of the latter have become established over time.

Islanders are full British citizens, and therefore until [[Brexit]] were European citizens. Any British citizen who applies for a passport in Jersey or Guernsey receives a passport bearing the words &quot;[[British Islands]], Bailiwick of Jersey&quot; or &quot;British Islands, Bailiwick of Guernsey&quot;. Under the provisions of Protocol Three, Channel Islanders who do not have a close connection with the UK (no parent or grandparent from the UK, and have never been resident in the UK for a five-year period) did not automatically benefit from the EU provisions on free movement within the EU, and their passports received an endorsement to that effect. This affected only a minority of islanders.

Under the UK [[Interpretation Act 1978]], the Channel Islands are deemed to be part of the British Islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1838152 |title=&quot;British Islands&quot; means the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

For the purposes of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]], the &quot;British Islands&quot; include the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland), the Channel Islands and the [[Isle of Man]], taken together, unless the context otherwise requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810061_en_8#pt5-l1g57 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |journal=Legislation, UK, Acts |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |quote=the Islands&quot; means the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; [...] the United Kingdom&quot; means Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Islands, taken together. |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001142348/https://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810061_en_8 |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df=dmy }} [Schedule 1., s. 50 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Jersey}}
{{See also|Guernsey pound|Jersey pound}}

Tourism is the major industry in the smaller islands (with some agriculture). However, Jersey and Guernsey have, since the 1960s, become major [[offshore financial centre]]s on the scale of the [[Cayman Islands]] or [[Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zyen.com/GFCI/GFCI%208.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 8|publisher=[[Z/Yen]]|year=2010|access-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011091643/http://www.zyen.com/GFCI/GFCI%208.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guernsey's horticultural and greenhouse activities have been more significant than in Jersey, and Guernsey has maintained [[light industry]] as a higher proportion of its economy than Jersey. Jersey's economy since the 1980s has been substantially more reliant on finance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Both islands are now heavily dependent on the finance industry, this along with a high cost of living has resulted in a general widening between the rich and poor.

Both bailiwicks issue their own banknotes and coins, which circulate freely in all the islands alongside UK coinage and Bank of England and Scottish banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/other_notes.aspx|title=Other British Islands' Notes {{!}} Bank of England|website=www.bankofengland.co.uk|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many exports, largely consisting of crafted goods and farmed produce.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Transport and communications ==

===Post===
{{main|Jersey Post|Guernsey Post}}
Since 1969, Jersey and Guernsey have operated postal administrations independently of the UK's [[Royal Mail]], with their own postage stamps, which can be used for postage only in their respective Bailiwicks. UK stamps are no longer valid, but mail to the islands, and to the [[Isle of Man]], is charged at UK inland rates. It was not until the early 1990s that the islands joined the [[UK postcodes|UK's postcode]] system, Jersey postcodes using the initials JE and Guernsey GY.

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Guernsey|Transport in Jersey}}

====Road====
{{main|Roads in Jersey}}
Each of the three largest islands has a distinct vehicle registration scheme:
* Guernsey (GBG): a number of up to five digits;
* Jersey (GBJ): ''J'' followed by up to six digits (''JSY'' vanity plates are also issued);
* Alderney (GBA): ''AY'' followed by up to five digits (four digits are the most that have been used, as redundant numbers are re-issued).

In [[Sark]], where most motor traffic is prohibited, the few vehicles –&amp;nbsp;nearly all tractors&amp;nbsp;– do not display plates. Bicycles display tax discs.

====Sea====
In the 1960s, names used for the cross-Channel ferries plying the mail route between the islands and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], Dorset, were taken from the popular Latin names for the islands: ''Caesarea'' (Jersey), ''Sarnia'' (Guernsey) and ''Riduna'' (Alderney). Fifty years later, the ferry route between the Channel Islands and the UK is operated by [[Condor Ferries]] from both St Helier, Jersey and St Peter Port, Guernsey, using high-speed catamaran fast craft to [[Poole]] in the UK. A regular passenger ferry service on the Commodore Clipper goes from both Channel Island ports to [[Portsmouth]] daily, and carries both passengers and freight.

Ferry services to Normandy are operated by Manche Îles Express, and services between Jersey and [[Saint-Malo]] are operated by Compagnie Corsaire and Condor Ferries.

The Isle of Sark Shipping Company operates small ferries to Sark.

On 20 August 2013, [[Huelin-Renouf]], which had operated a &quot;lift-on lift-off&quot; container service for 80 years between the [[Port of Southampton]] and the Port of [[Jersey]], ceased trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-23766025|title=Shipping company stops trading|date=20 August 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Alan J. H. Maclean|Alan Maclean]], a Jersey politician, had previously tried to save the 90-odd jobs furnished by the company to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-23737973|title=Shipping company at risk of closure|date=17 August 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September, it was announced that [[Channel Island Lines]] would continue this service, and would purchase the MV [[Huelin Dispatch]] from [[Associated British Ports]] who in turn had purchased them from the receiver in the bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=cil&gt;{{cite news|title=New Channel Island company offers freight service |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-24176612 |work=BBC News |date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new operator was to be funded by [[Rockayne Limited]], a closely held association of Jersey businesspeople.&lt;ref name=cil/&gt;

====Air====
There are three airports in the Channel Islands; [[Alderney Airport]], [[Guernsey Airport]] and [[Jersey Airport]], which are directly connected to each other by services operated by [[Blue Islands]] and [[Aurigny]].

====Rail====
Historically there have been railway networks on Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, but all of the lines on Jersey and Guernsey have been closed and dismantled. Today there are three working railways in the Channel Islands, of which the [[Alderney Railway]] is the only one providing a regular timetabled passenger service. The other two are a {{RailGauge|7.25in}} gauge miniature railway, also on Alderney, and the heritage steam railway operated on Jersey as part of the [[Pallot Heritage Steam Museum]].

===Media===
Regional television and radio broadcasts are available in the islands.  These services are provided by [[BBC Radio Jersey]], [[BBC Radio Guernsey]], [[Spotlight (BBC News)#BBC Channel Islands|BBC Channel Islands]], [[ITV Channel Television]], [[Island FM]], and [[Channel 103]]. Jubilee Hospital Radio provided Guernsey hospitals with a radio service, Radio Lions serves Jersey hospitals.  Bailiwick Radio broadcasts two music services online, through Apple &amp; Android apps and on TuneIn.

Television programmes are broadcast from the [[Frémont Point transmitting station]].  A local television service was called Channel Islands Live started transmitting in early 2016, from the studios at Dorset Street, St. Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands.

There are several local newspapers including the ''[[Guernsey Press and Star|Guernsey Press]]'' and the ''[[Jersey Evening Post]]'' and magazines.

===Telephone===
{{main|Telecommunications in Jersey}}
Jersey always operated its own telephone services independently of Britain's national system, Guernsey established its own telephone service in 1968. Both islands still form part of the [[Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom|British telephone numbering plan]], but [[Ofcom]] on the mainlines does not have responsibility for telecommunications regulatory and licensing issues on the islands. It is responsible for wireless telegraphy licensing throughout the islands, and by agreement, for broadcasting regulation in the two large islands only.

===Internet===
Modern broadband speeds are available in all the islands, including [[VDSL]] for home and business. Providers include [[Sure (company)|Sure]] and [[Jersey Telecom|JT]].

The two Bailiwicks each have their own internet domain, [[.GG]] (Guernsey, Alderney, Sark) and [[.JE]] (Jersey), which are managed by channelisles.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelisles.net|title=Channel Isles: The Islands' Domain Names :: Home|website=www.channelisles.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norman language]] predominated in the islands until the nineteenth century, when increasing influence from English-speaking settlers and easier transport links led to Anglicisation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Country'', Kelleher, Jersey 1994, {{ISBN|0-9518162-4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main dialects/languages of Norman in the islands, [[Auregnais]] (Alderney, extinct in late twentieth century), [[Guernésiais|Dgèrnésiais]] (Guernsey), [[Jèrriais]] (Jersey) and [[Sercquiais]] (Sark, an offshoot of Jèrriais).&lt;ref&gt;''La Grève de Lecq'', Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 {{ISBN|2-905385-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]] spent many years in exile, first in Jersey and then in Guernsey, where he finished ''[[Les Misérables]]''. Guernsey is the setting of Hugo's later novel, ''Les Travailleurs de la Mer'' (''[[Toilers of the Sea]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/trail-of-the-unexpected-victor-hugorsquos-guernsey-2016740.html &quot;Trail of the unexpected: Victor Hugo’s Guernsey&quot;], ''[[The Independent]]'', 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Guernsey-man&quot; also makes an appearance in chapter 91 of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Melville]], ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (St Botoph Society edition, 1892) pp. 381–384.

The annual &quot;[[Muratti]]&quot;, the inter-island [[association football|football]] match, is considered the sporting event of the year, although, due to broadcast coverage, it no longer attracts the crowds of spectators, travelling between the islands, that it did during the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/05/08/passion-plays-a-part-%E2%80%93-right-across-the-board/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |accessdate=4 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510011955/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/05/08/passion-plays-a-part-%E2%80%93-right-across-the-board/ |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cricket]] is popular in the Channel Islands. The [[Jersey cricket team]] and the [[Guernsey cricket team]] are both associate members of the [[International Cricket Council]]. The teams have played each other in the [[inter-insular match]] since 1957. In 2001 and 2002, the Channel Islands entered a team into the [[MCCA Knockout Trophy]], the one-day tournament of the [[minor counties of English and Welsh cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/67/Minor_Counties_Trophy_Matches.html |title=Minor Counties Trophy Matches played by Channel Islands |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel Island sportsmen and women compete in the [[Commonwealth Games]] for their respective islands and the islands have also been enthusiastic supporters of the [[Island Games]]. Shooting is a popular sport, in which islanders have won Commonwealth medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/countries/tally_sports.asp |title=Thecgf.com |publisher=Thecgf.com |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Guernsey: ''les ânes'' (&quot;[[donkey]]s&quot; in French and Norman): the steepness of St Peter Port streets required beasts of burden, but Guernsey people also claim it is a symbol of their strength of character{{spaced ndash}}which Jersey people traditionally interpret as stubbornness.
* Jersey: ''les crapauds'' (&quot;[[toad]]s&quot; in French and Jèrriais): Jersey has toads and snakes, which Guernsey lacks.
* Sark: ''les corbins'' (&quot;[[crow]]s&quot; in [[Sercquiais]], [[Dgèrnésiais]] and [[Jèrriais]], ''les corbeaux'' in French): crows could be seen from the sea on the island's coast.
* Alderney: ''les lapins'' (&quot;[[rabbit]]s&quot; in French and [[Auregnais]]): the island is noted for its [[warren (domestic)|warren]]s.

=== Faith and religious history ===
{{main|List of churches, chapels and meeting halls in the Channel Islands}}
Christianity was brought to the islands around the sixth century; according to tradition, Jersey was evangelised by St [[Helier]], Guernsey by St [[Samson of Dol]], and the smaller islands were occupied at various times by monastic communities representing strands of [[Celtic Christianity]]. At the [[Reformation]], the islands turned [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] under the influence of an influx of French-language pamphlets published in [[Geneva]]. [[Anglicanism]] was imposed in the seventeenth century, but the Non-Conformist tendency re-emerged with a strong adoption of [[Methodism]]. The presence of long-term Catholic communities from France and seasonal workers from Brittany and Normandy added to the mix of denominations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In the late twentieth century, a strong Roman Catholic presence re-emerged with the many Portuguese workers (both from mainland [[Portugal]] and the island of [[Madeira]]) coming to live in the islands, and more recently Polish Roman Catholics and other Eastern Europe worshipers came. Today, more evangelical churches have been established. Services are held in a number of languages.

39% of the population are non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://humanism.org.uk/2015/12/02/first-ever-jersey-official-religion-statistics-show-39-of-islanders-are-non-religious/ |title=First ever Jersey official religion statistics show 39% of islanders are non-religious |date=2015-12-02
