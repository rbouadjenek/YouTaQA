In December 1630, the site of what would become Cambridge was chosen because it was safely upriver from [[Boston Harbor]], making it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. [[Thomas Dudley]], his daughter [[Anne Bradstreet]], and her husband Simon were among the town's first settlers. The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as &quot;the newe towne&quot;.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}&lt;ref name=&quot;abbott1880&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Rev.

Located at the first convenient Charles River crossing west of Boston, Newe Towne was one of a number of towns (including Boston, [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]]) founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] under Governor [[John Winthrop]]. Its first preacher was [[Thomas Hooker]], who led many of its original inhabitants west in 1636 to found [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and the [[Connecticut Colony]]; before leaving, they sold their plots to more recent immigrants from England.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

The original village site is now within [[Harvard Square]]. The [[Farmers' market|marketplace]] where farmers sold crops from surrounding towns at the edge of a salt marsh (since filled) remains within a small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy and Winthrop Streets.

The town comprised a much larger area than the present city,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years: Cambridge Village (later Newtown and now [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]]) in 1688,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritter |first=Priscilla R. |author2=Thelma Fleishman |title=Newton, Massachusetts 1679–1779: A Biographical Directory |year=1982 |publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Farms (now [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]]) in 1712{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} or 1713,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310152201/http://www.lexingtonchamber.org/history.html |contribution=History |title=Lexington Chamber of Commerce |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Little or South Cambridge (now [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]]){{refn|group=lower-alpha|Brighton was annexed by Boston in 1874.}} and Menotomy or West Cambridge (now [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]]) in 1807.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightonbot.com/history.php |title=A Short History of Allston-Brighton |first=Marchione |last=William P. |year=2011 |work=Brighton-Allston Historical Society |publisher=Brighton Board of Trade |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220031829/http://www.brightonbot.com/history.php |archivedate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Part of West Cambridge joined the new town of [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] in 1859; the rest of West Cambridge was renamed Arlington in 1867.}} In the late 19th century, various schemes for annexing Cambridge to Boston were pursued and rejected.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite news |title=Annexation And Its Fruits |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1874/01/15/archives/annexation-and-its-fruits.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 15, 1874 |page=4 |archiveurl=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/01/15/79213345.pdf |archivedate=January 15, 1874}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite news |title=Boston's Annexation Schemes.; Proposal To Absorb Cambridge And Other Near-By Towns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1892/03/27/archives/bostons-annexation-schemes-proposal-to-absorb-cambridge-and-other.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 1892 |page=11 |accessdate=August 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/03/27/104093600.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1636, the Newe College (later renamed [[Harvard College]] after benefactor [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]]) was founded by the Massachusetts Bay Colony to train [[minister (religion)|ministers]]. According to [[Cotton Mather]], Newe Towne was chosen for the site of the college by the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]] (the Massachusetts legislature) primarily for its proximity to the popular and highly respected Puritan preacher [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]]. In May 1638,&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite book |title=The Cambridge of Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-six |editor=Arthur Gilman |publisher=Committee on the Memorial Volume |location=Cambridge |year=1896 |page=8}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/05.02/02-history.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118015220/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/05.02/02-history.html |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |title=This month in Harvard history |work=[[Harvard Gazette]] |date=May 2, 2002 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}. (This source gives May 12, 1638, as the date of the name change; others say May 2, 1638, or late 1637.)&lt;/ref&gt; the settlement's name was changed to '''Cambridge''' in honor of the university in [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], England.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hannah Winthrop Chapter, D.A.R. |title=Historic Guide to Cambridge |edition=Second |year=1907 |publisher=Hannah Winthrop Chapter, D.A.R. |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=20–21 |quote=On October 15, 1637, the Great and General Court passed a vote that: &quot;The college is ordered to bee at Newetowne.&quot; In this same year the name of Newetowne was changed to Cambridge, (&quot;It is ordered that Newetowne shall henceforward be called Cambridge&quot;) in honor of the university in Cambridge, England, where many of the early settlers were educated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newtowne's ministers, Hooker and Shepard, the college's [[Henry Dunster|first president]], the college's major benefactor, and the first schoolmaster [[Nathaniel Eaton]] were all Cambridge alumni, as was the colony's governor John Winthrop. In 1629, Winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of Boston, which was known as the [[Cambridge Agreement]], after the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winthropsociety.org/doc_cambr.php |publisher=[[The Winthrop Society]] |title=Descendants of the Great Migration |accessdate=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1650, Governor Thomas Dudley signed the charter creating the corporation that still governs Harvard College.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web |url=http://library.harvard.edu/university-archives/using-the-collections/online-resources/charter-of-1650 |title=Harvard Charter of 1650 |publisher=[[Harvard University Archives]] |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite book |title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts |chapter-url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/const.htm |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |edition= |series= |volume= |date=September 1, 1779 |publisher=The General Court of Massachusetts |location= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |page= |pages= |chapter=Chapter V: The University at Cambridge, and encouragement of literature, etc. |chapterurl= |ref= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Washington taking command of the American Army at Cambridge, 1775 - NARA - 532874.tif|thumb|right|[[George Washington]] in Cambridge, 1775]]
Cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} by road from Boston, the colony's capital. By the [[American Revolution]], most residents lived near the [[Cambridge Common|Common]] and Harvard College, with most of the town comprising farms and estates. Most inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of [[Anglicans|Anglican]] &quot;worthies&quot; who were not involved in village life, made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along &quot;the Road to Watertown&quot; (today's [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]], still known as [[Tory Row]]).

Coming north from [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], George Washington took command of the volunteer American soldiers camped on Cambridge Common on July 3, 1775,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} now reckoned the birthplace of the [[U.S. Army]].{{efn|The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.}} Most of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, [[Henry Knox]] arrived with artillery captured from [[Fort Ticonderoga]], which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.

[[File:Cambridge 1873 WardMap.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Cambridge from 1873]]
Between 1790 and 1840, Cambridge grew rapidly, with the construction of the [[West Boston Bridge]] in 1792 connecting Cambridge directly to Boston, so that it was no longer necessary to travel {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Boston Neck]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to cross the Charles River. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new [[Middlesex Canal]]. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and [[marsh]]land into prime industrial and residential districts.

In the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution. It was home to some of the famous Fireside Poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. The [[Fireside Poets]]—[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]—were highly popular and influential in their day.

Soon after, [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were built: the [[Cambridge and Concord Turnpike]] (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]] (Hampshire St. and [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Ave.]] northwest of [[Porter Square]]), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets connected various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, the town was connected to the [[Boston &amp; Maine Railroad]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=96}} leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] from the formerly rural parts of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].

Cambridge is toward the bottom of the map and outlined in yellow, and should not be confused with the pink-outlined and partially cropped &quot;West Cambridge&quot;, now [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]].]]
Cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} despite persistent tensions between East Cambridge, Cambridgeport, and Old Cambridge stemming from differences in culture, sources of income, and the national origins of the residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cambridgeconsidered.blogspot.com/2011/01/very-brief-history-of-cambridge-1800.html |title=Cambridge Considered: A Very Brief History of Cambridge: 1800–1900, Part 1 |first=Tegan |last=Kehoe |date=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square, which became the city's downtown around that time.

Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character—[[streetcar suburb]]an development along the turnpikes, with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing on the old Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge estates, and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills. The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge led to three major changes: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and [[Alewife Brook]]; the ice-cutting industry launched by [[Frederic Tudor]] on [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]]; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries.

For many decades, the city's largest employer was the [[New England Glass Company]], founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the world's largest and most modern glassworks. In 1888, [[Edward Libbey|Edward Drummond Libbey]] moved all production to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where it continues today under the name [[Owens-Illinois]]. The company's flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] has a large collection. The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and the Sandwich Glass Museum on [[Cape Cod]] also have a few pieces.

In 1895, [[Edwin Ginn]] founder of [[Ginn and Company]] built the [[Athenaeum Press]] Building for his publishing text book empire.

By 1920, Cambridge was one of [[New England]]'s main industrial cities, with nearly 120,000 residents. Among the largest businesses in Cambridge during the period of industrialization was [[Carter's Ink Company]], whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the world's largest ink manufacturer.

Only the [[Cambridge Brands]] subsidiary of Tootsie Roll Industries remains in town, still manufacturing Junior Mints in the old Welch factory on Main Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welch&quot; /&gt; The [[Blake and Knowles Steam Pump Company National Register District|Blake and Knowles Steam Pump Company]] (1886), the [[Kendall Boiler and Tank Company]] (1880, now in [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]]) and the New England Glass Company (1818–1878) were among the industrial manufacturers in what are now Kendall Square and East Cambridge.

As industry in New England began to decline during the [[Great Depression]] and after World War II, Cambridge lost much of its industrial base. It also began to become an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important as both a landowner and an institution, but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When Radcliffe College was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's move from Boston in 1916 reinforced Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.

After the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. In Cambridge Highlands, the technology company [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek, &amp; Newman]] produced [[Interface Message Processor|the first network router]] in 1969, and hosted the invention of computer-to-computer email in 1971. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups. Those selling advanced [[minicomputer]]s were overtaken by the [[microcomputer]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Cambridge-based [[VisiCorp]] made the first [[spreadsheet]] software for personal computers, [[Visicalc]], and helped propel the [[Apple II]] to major consumer success. It was overtaken and purchased by Cambridge-based [[Lotus Development]], maker of [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. (This was in turn replaced in the market by [[Microsoft Excel]]).

The city continues to be home to many startups. Kendall Square was a major software hub through the [[dot-com boom]] and today hosts offices of such technology companies as Google, [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. The Square also now houses the headquarters of [[Akamai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/locations.jsp |title=Locations – Akamai |website=Akamai.com |accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Harvard's plans to start experiments with recombinant DNA led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel. In the end, Cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977. This led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when [[Biogen]] opened a lab in 1982, in contrast to the hostility that caused the Genetic Institute (a Harvard spinoff) to abandon Somerville and Boston for Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/17/how-cambridge-became-the-life-sciences-capital/ |title=How Cambridge became the life sciences capital}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in Cambridge, which now includes headquarters for Biogen and [[Genzyme]]; laboratories for [[Novartis]], [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals|Alnylam]], [[Ironwood Pharmaceuticals|Ironwood]], [[Catabasis Pharmaceuticals|Catabasis]], [[Moderna Therapeutics]], [[Editas Medicine]]; support companies such as [[Cytel]]; and many smaller companies.

By the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most costly housing markets in the Northeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Glaeser |first=E. L. |date=April 1, 2005 |title=Reinventing Boston: 1630–2003 |journal=Journal of Economic Geography |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=119–153 |doi=10.1093/jnlecg/lbh058 |issn=1468-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt; While considerable class, race, and age diversity persisted, it became harder for those who grew up in the city to afford to stay. The end of [[rent control]] in 1994 prompted many Cambridge renters to move to more affordable housing in Somerville and other cities or towns.

Until recently, Cambridge's mix of amenities and proximity to Boston kept housing prices relatively stable despite the bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/article/20150417/NEWS/150417123 |title=Housing prices soar after years of stability in Cambridge |last=dmclean@wickedlocal.com |first=Danielle McLean |work=Cambridge Chronicle &amp; Tab |access-date=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge has been a [[sanctuary city]] since 1985 and reaffirmed its status as such in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web |url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityClerk/PolicyOrder.cfm?item_id=13247 |publisher=City of Cambridge |title=City Council Policy Order Resolution O-16 |date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-boston-bombings-cambridge-20130421,0,2121257.story |work=Los Angeles Times |title=In immigrant-rich Cambridge, arrest baffles locals |first1=Melanie |last1=Mason |first2=Michael J. |last2=Mishak |first3=Ashley |last3=Powers |date=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Charles River Cambridge USA.jpg|thumb|upright|A view from Boston of Harvard's [[Weld Boathouse]] and Cambridge in winter. The [[Charles River]] is in the foreground.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Cambridge has a total area of {{convert|7.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (9.82%) is water.

=== Adjacent municipalities ===
Cambridge is located in eastern Massachusetts, bordered by:
* the city of Boston to the south (across the Charles River) and east
* the city of Somerville to the north
* the town of Arlington to the northwest
* the town of [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] and
* the city of Watertown to the west

The border between Cambridge and the neighboring city of Somerville passes through densely populated neighborhoods which are connected by the [[Red Line (MBTA)|MBTA Red Line]]. Some of the main squares, [[Inman Square|Inman]], Porter, and to a lesser extent, Harvard and [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere]], are very close to the city line, as are Somerville's [[Union Square (Somerville)|Union]] and [[Davis Square]]s.

Through the City of Cambridge's exclusive municipal water system, the city further controls two [[exclave]] areas, one being Payson Park Reservoir and Gatehouse, a [[American and Canadian Water Landmark|2009 listed American Water Landmark]] located roughly one mile west of Fresh Pond and surrounded by the town of Belmont.  The second area is the larger Hobbs Brook and [[Stony Brook (Middlesex County, Massachusetts)|Stony Brook]] watersheds, which share borders with neighboring towns and cities including Lexington, [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]].

==== Squares ====
Cambridge has been called the &quot;City of Squares&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web |author=No Writer Attributed |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1969/9/18/cambridge-a-city-of-squares-pcambridge/ |title=&quot;Cambridge: A City of Squares&quot; Harvard Crimson, September 18, 1969 |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=September 18, 1969 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite web |url=http://www.travelwritersmagazine.com/RonBernthal/Cambridge.html |title=Cambridge Journal: Massachusetts City No Longer in Boston's Shadow |publisher=Travelwritersmagazine.com |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417231041/http://www.travelwritersmagazine.com/RonBernthal/Cambridge.html |archivedate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as most of its commercial districts are major street intersections known as [[Town square|squares]]. Each square acts as a neighborhood center. These include:
* [[Kendall Square]], formed by the junction of Broadway, Main Street, and Third Street, has been called &quot;the most innovtive square mile on the planet&quot;, owing to its high concentration of [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] [[startup company|start-ups]] and quality of innovation which have emerged in the vicinity of the square since 2010.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMAWorldInnovationCapital1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CambridgeMAWorldInnovationCapital2/&gt; [[Technology Square (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Technology Square]] is an office and laboratory building cluster in this neighborhood. Just over the [[Longfellow Bridge]] from Boston, at the eastern end of the MIT campus, it is served by the [[Kendall (MBTA station)|Kendall/MIT]] station on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] Red Line subway. Most of Cambridge's large office towers are located in the Square. A  [[biotech]] industry has developed in this area. The [[Cambridge Innovation Center]], a large co-working space, is in Kendall Square at 1 Broadway. The Cambridge Center office complex is in Kendall Square, and not at the actual center of Cambridge. The &quot;One Kendall Square&quot; complex is nearby, but   not actually in Kendall Square.
* [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]], formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Prospect Street, and Western Avenue. Containing a variety of ethnic restaurants, it was economically depressed as recently as the late 1990s; it underwent [[gentrification]] in recent years (in conjunction with the development of the nearby [[University Park at MIT]]), and continues to grow more costly. It is served by the [[Central (MBTA station)|Central Station]] stop on the MBTA Red Line subway. '''Lafayette Square''', formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Columbia Street, Sidney Street, and Main Street, is considered part of the Central Square area. [[Cambridgeport]] is south of Central Square along Magazine Street and Brookline Street.
* Harvard Square, formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and JFK Street. This is the primary site of Harvard University and a major Cambridge shopping area. It is served by a [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. Harvard Square was originally the Red Line's northwestern terminus and a major transfer point to streetcars that also operated in a short [[Harvard Bus Tunnel|tunnel]]—which is still a major bus terminal, although the area under the Square was reconfigured dramatically in the 1980s when the Red Line was extended. The Harvard Square area includes '''Brattle Square''' and '''Eliot Square'''. A short distance away from the square lies the Cambridge Common, while the neighborhood north of Harvard and east of Massachusetts Avenue is known as Agassiz, after the famed scientist [[Louis Agassiz]].
* Porter Square, about a mile north on Massachusetts Avenue from Harvard Square, at the junction of Massachusetts and Somerville Avenues. It includes part of the city of Somerville and is served by the [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter Square Station]], a complex housing a Red Line stop and a [[Fitchburg Line]] [[MBTA commuter rail|commuter rail]] stop. Lesley University's University Hall and Porter campus are in Porter Square.
* Inman Square, at the junction of Cambridge and Hampshire streets in Mid-Cambridge. It is home to restaurants, bars, music venues and boutiques. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] streetlights, benches and bus stops were recently added to the streets, and a new city park was installed.
* Lechmere Square, at the junction of Cambridge and First streets, adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall. It is the MBTA [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]'s northern terminus, at [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere Station]].

Manufacturing was an important part of Cambridge's economy in the late 19th and early 20th century, but educational institutions are its biggest employers today.

=== Music ===
&lt;!-- Made section generic. Needs more work. --&gt;

=== Parks and recreation ===
[[File:Alewife Brook Reservation.jpg|thumb|Alewife Brook Reservation]]
Consisting largely of densely built residential space, Cambridge lacks significant tracts of public parkland. Easily accessible open space on the university campuses, including [[Harvard Yard]], the [[Radcliffe Yard]], and MIT's Great Lawn, as well as the considerable open space of [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], partly compensates for this. At Cambridge's western edge, the cemetery is  known as a garden cemetery because its landscaping (the oldest planned landscape in the country) and [[arboretum]]. Although known as a Cambridge landmark, much of the cemetery lies within Watertown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Cambridge map |publisher=City of Cambridge |year=2007 |url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CambridgeStreetMap18x24_032007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) in the Greater Boston area.

Public parkland includes the esplanade along the Charles River, which mirrors its [[Charles River Esplanade|Boston counterpart]]; Cambridge Common, a busy and historic public park adjacent to Harvard's campus; and the [[Alewife Brook Reservation]] and Fresh Pond in western Cambridge.

[[File:CambridgeMACityHall1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cambridge, Massachusetts City Hall|Cambridge City Hall]] in the 1980s]]
{{anchor|govt}}Cambridge has a city government led by a [[List of mayors of Cambridge, Massachusetts|mayor]] and a nine-member city council. There is also a six-member school committee that functions alongside the superintendent of public schools. The councilors and school committee members are elected every two years using the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/electioncommission/cambridgemunicipalelections |title=Cambridge Municipal Elections |publisher=City of Cambridge |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge is one of a small number of local governments in the U.S. to use [[ranked-choice voting]]; by 2019, the State of Maine and about 18 local governments have adopted similar systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/11/05/ranked-choice-voting-adopted-in-new-york-city-along-with-other-ballot-measures-1226390|author=Erin Durkin|newspaper=Politico|title=Ranked-choice voting adopted in New York City, along with other ballot measures|date=November 5, 2019|quote=Ranked-choice voting is now in use or approved in 18 other cities around the country, including San Francisco, Minneapolis and Cambridge. The state of Maine also uses it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mayor is elected by the city councilors from among themselves, and serves as the chair of city council meetings. The mayor also sits on the school committee. The mayor is not the city's chief executive. Rather, the city manager, who is appointed by the city council, serves in that capacity.

Under the city's Plan E form of government, the city council does not have the power to appoint or remove city officials who are under direction of the city manager. The city council and its individual members are also forbidden from giving orders to any subordinate of the city manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/planE.pdf |publisher=City of Cambridge |title=Plan E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== County government ===
Cambridge was a [[county seat]] of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], along with Lowell, until the abolition of county government. Though the county government was abolished in 1997, the county still exists as a geographical and political region. The employees of Middlesex County courts, jails, registries, and other county agencies now work directly for the state. The county's registrars of [[Deed]]s and Probate remain in Cambridge, but the Superior Court and District Attorney have had their operations transferred to [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]]. Third District court has shifted operations to [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], and the county Sheriff's office awaits near-term relocation.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/02/14/court_move_a_hassle_for_commuters/ |title=Court move a hassle for commuters |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |first=Eric |last=Moskowitz |date=February 14, 2008 |work=[[Boston Globe]] |quote=In a little more than a month, Middlesex Superior Court will open in Woburn after nearly four decades at the Edward J.

Cambridge Community Television (CCTV) has served the city since its inception in 1988. CCTV operates Cambridge's public access television facility and three television channels, 8, 9, and 96, on the Cambridge cable system (Comcast). The city has invited tenders from other cable providers, but Comcast remains its only fixed television and broadband utility,&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/consumercouncil/cambridgecableinformation.aspx |title=Cable Television in the City of Cambridge |year=2013 |work=Cambridge Consumers' Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508210917/http://www.cambridgema.gov/consumercouncil/cambridgecableinformation.aspx |archivedate=May 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |quote=Comcast is currently the only cable operator that has sought a license with Cambridge.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
{{See also|Boston transportation}}

==== Road ====
[[File:Harvard Square at Peabody Street and Mass Avenue.jpg|thumb|[[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Harvard Square]]]]
Several major roads lead to Cambridge, including [[Massachusetts State Highway 2|Route 2]], [[Massachusetts State Highway 16|Route 16]] and the [[Massachusetts State Highway 28|McGrath Highway (Route 28)]]. The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] does not pass through Cambridge, but provides access by an exit in nearby [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]. Both [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[I-93 (MA)|Interstate 93]] also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in Boston. [[Massachusetts State Highway 2A|Route 2A]] runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, including the Longfellow Bridge and the [[Harvard Bridge]], eight of which are open to motorized road traffic.

Cambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major &quot;squares&quot; are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and Central Square, or Hampshire Street between Kendall Square and Inman Square.

==== Mass transit ====
[[File:Central MBTA station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Central (MBTA)|Central Station]] on the [[MBTA Red Line]]]]
Cambridge is served by the [[MBTA]], including the Porter Square Station on the regional [[MBTA Commuter Rail|Commuter Rail]]; the Lechmere Station on the Green Line; and the Red Line at [[Alewife Station (MBTA)|Alewife]], [[Porter (MBTA)|Porter Square]], Harvard Square, Central Square, and [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall Square/MIT]] Stations. Alewife Station, the terminus of the Red Line, has a large multi-story parking garage (at a rate of $7 per day {{as of|lc=y|2015}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=10029 |title=&gt; Schedules &amp; Maps &gt; Subway &gt; Alewife Station |publisher=MBTA |accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Bus Tunnel, under Harvard Square, connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912, and served trackless trolleys ([[trolleybus]]es) and buses as the routes were converted; four lines of the [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|MBTA trolleybus system]] continue to use it. The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.

Besides the state-owned transit agency, the city is also served by the Charles River Transportation Management Agency (CRTMA) shuttles which are supported by some of the largest companies operating in city, in addition to the municipal government itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |title=Charles River TMA Members |date=January 1, 2013 |work=CRTMA |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127055722/http://charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |archivedate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cycling ====
Cambridge has several [[bike path]]s, including one along the Charles River,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117145514/http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 17, 2004 |title=Dr. Paul Dudley White Bikepath |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cambridge Linear Park|Linear Park]] connecting the [[Minuteman Bikeway]] at Alewife with the [[Somerville Community Path]]. A [[Watertown Branch Railroad|connection to Watertown]] is under construction. Bike parking is common and there are bike lanes on many streets, although concerns have been expressed regarding the suitability of many of the lanes. On several central MIT streets, bike lanes transfer onto the sidewalk. Cambridge bans cycling on certain sections of sidewalk where pedestrian traffic is heavy.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_ban.html |title=Sidewalk Bicycling Banned Areas – Cambridge Massachusetts |publisher=City of Cambridge |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419060953/http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_ban.html |archivedate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_reg.html |title=Traffic Regulations for Cyclists – Cambridge Massachusetts |publisher=City of Cambridge |date=May 1, 1997 |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521205927/http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_reg.html |archivedate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''[[Bicycling Magazine]]'' in 2006 rated Boston as one of the worst cities in the nation for bicycling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacLaughlin, Nina |year=2006 |title=Boston Can Be Bike City...If You Fix These Five Big Problems |journal=The Phoenix – Bicycle Bible 2006 |url=http://thephoenix.com/supplements/2006/bicyclebible/article.aspx?ID=Boston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811055614/http://thephoenix.com/supplements/2006/bicyclebible/article.aspx?ID=Boston |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has given Cambridge honorable mention as one of the best&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023835/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1%2C6610%2Cs1-2-16-14593-9%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |title=Urban Treasures |last=Fiske |first=Brian |work=Bicycling Magazine |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was called by the magazine &quot;Boston's Great Hope&quot;.

==== Walking ====
[[File:Weeks Footbridge Cambridge, MA.jpg|thumb|The [[John W. Weeks Bridge|Weeks Bridge]] provides a pedestrian-only connection between Boston's Allston-Brighton neighborhood and Cambridge over the Charles River]]
Walking is a popular activity in Cambridge. In 2000, of US cities with more than 100,000 residents, Cambridge had the highest percentage of commuters who walked to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bikesatwork.com/carfree/census-lookup.php?state_select=ALL_STATES&amp;lower_pop=100000&amp;upper_pop=99999999&amp;sort_num=2&amp;show_rows=25&amp;first_row=0 |title=The Carfree Census Database: Result of search for communities in any state with population over 100,000, sorted in descending order by % Pedestrian Commuters |publisher=Bikesatwork.com |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge's major historic squares have changed into modern walking neighborhoods, including [[traffic calming]] features based on the needs of pedestrians rather than of motorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Transportation/programs/currentprograms/pedestrianplan |title=City of Cambridge Pedestrian Plan |publisher=CambridgeMA.gov |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intercity ====
The Boston intercity bus and train stations at [[South Station]], Boston, and [[Logan International Airport]] in [[East Boston]], are accessible by subway. The Fitchburg Line rail service from Porter Square connects to some western suburbs. Since October 2010, there has also been intercity bus service between [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife Station]] (Cambridge) and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Sarah |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/10/warren_mbta_welcome_world_wide.html |title=NYC-bound buses will roll from Newton, Cambridge |work=Boston Globe |date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Cambridge Police Department, the city is patrolled by the Fifth (Brighton) Barracks of Troop H of the [[Massachusetts State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&amp;L2=Law+Enforcement&amp;L3=State+Police+Troops&amp;L4=Troop+H&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_h_msp_field_troop_h_station_h5&amp;csid=Eeops |title=Station H-5, SP Brighton |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204093603/http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Law+Enforcement+&amp;+Criminal+Justice&amp;L2=Law+Enforcement&amp;L3=State+Police+Troops&amp;L4=Troop+H&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_h_msp_field_troop_h_station_h5&amp;csid=Eeops |archivedate=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due, however, to close proximity, the city also practices functional cooperation with the Fourth (Boston) Barracks of Troop H, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&amp;L2=Law+Enforcement&amp;L3=State+Police+Troops&amp;L4=Troop+H&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_h_msp_field_troop_h_station_h4&amp;csid=Eeops |title=Station H-4, SP Boston |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204093602/http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Law+Enforcement+&amp;+Criminal+Justice&amp;L2=Law+Enforcement&amp;L3=State+Police+Troops&amp;L4=Troop+H&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_h_msp_field_troop_h_station_h4&amp;csid=Eeops |archivedate=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campuses of Harvard and MIT are patrolled by the [[Harvard University Police Department]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department|MIT Police Department]], respectively.

=== Fire department ===
[[File:Cambridge Engine 2 Ladder 3 firehouse jeh.jpg|thumb|Engine 2, Ladder 3 firehouse]]
The city of Cambridge is protected by the Cambridge Fire Department. Established in 1832, the CFD operates eight engine companies, four ladder companies, one rescue company, and two paramedic squad companies from eight fire stations located throughout the city. The Acting Chief is Gerard Mahoney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/cfd/aboutus.aspx |title=City of Cambridge Fire Department: About Us |publisher=cambridgema.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water department ===
Cambridge is unusual among cities inside Route 128 in having a non-[[MWRA]] water supply. City water is obtained from [[Hobbs Brook]] (in Lincoln and Waltham) and [[Stony Brook (Boston)|Stony Brook]] (Waltham and Weston). The city owns over {{convert|1200|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land in other towns that includes these reservoirs and portions of their watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CWD/wat_lands.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040531100327/http://www.cambridgema.gov/CWD/wat_lands.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 31, 2004 |title=Cambridge Watershed Lands &amp; Facilities |publisher=.cambridgema.gov |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water from these reservoirs flows by gravity through an aqueduct to [[Fresh Pond (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Fresh Pond]] in Cambridge. It is then treated in an adjacent plant and pumped uphill to an elevation of {{convert|176|ft|m}} [[above sea level]] at the Payson Park Reservoir (Belmont). The water is then redistributed downhill via gravity to individual users in the city.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CWD_March_2010.pdf |title=Water supply system |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/CWD/fpfaqs.cfm |title=Is Fresh Pond really used for drinking water? |publisher=Cambridge Water Department |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302040328/http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CWD/fpfaqs.cfm |archivedate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new water treatment plant opened in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/wateroperationsdivision/watertreatment |title=Water Treatment |website=City of Cambridge, Massachusetts |access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city used MWRA water during the old plant's demolition and the new plant's construction.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In October 2016, the City of Cambridge announced that, due to drought conditions, they would begin buying water from the MWRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/10/17/cambridge-begin-buying-water-from-mwra/6RhEx8I8ggrrj54njzwteI/story.html |title=Cambridge to begin buying water from MWRA |work=Boston Globe |access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2017, Cambridge announced that &quot;As a result of continued rainfall each month since October 2016, we have been able to significantly reduce the need to use MWRA water. We have not purchased any MWRA water since December 12, 2016 and if 'average' rainfall continues this could continue for several months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cambridgema.gov/~/link.aspx?_id=68DCA993566D4B90A695CB129313F620&amp;_z=z |title=Cambridge Continues Temporary MWRA Water Usage – Water – City of Cambridge, Massachusetts |website=Cambridgema.gov |access-date=March 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313125530/http://www.cambridgema.gov/~/link.aspx?_id=68DCA993566D4B90A695CB129313F620&amp;_z=z |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public library services ===
{{Main|Cambridge Public Library}}
Further educational services are provided at the Cambridge Public Library. The large modern main building was built in 2009, and connects to the restored 1888 Richardson Romanesque building. It was founded as the private Cambridge Athenaeum in 1849 and was acquired by the city in 1858, and became the Dana Library. The 1888 building was a donation of [[Frederick H. Rindge]].
