Belfast is still a major port, with commercial and industrial docks, including the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard, dominating the [[Belfast Lough]] shoreline.

==Name==
The name Belfast is derived from the Irish ''{{lang|ga|Béal Feirsde}}'', which was later spelt ''{{lang|ga|Béal Feirste}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot;/&gt; The word ''{{lang|ga|béal}}'' means &quot;mouth&quot; or &quot;rivermouth&quot; while ''{{lang|ga|feirsde/feirste}}'' is the genitive singular of ''{{lang|ga|fearsaid}}'' and refers to a [[shoal|sandbar]] or tidal [[ford (crossing)|ford]] across a river's mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/118005.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfast: '''view the scanned records''' |publisher=Logainm.ie |accessdate=25 May 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702093937/http://www.logainm.ie/118005.aspx |archive-date=2 July 2013 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast name&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Placenames/Logainmneacha – Belfast |website=BBC Northern Ireland – Education |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml |accessdate=17 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115045404/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml |archive-date=15 January 2009 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name therefore translates literally as &quot;(river) mouth of the sandbar&quot; or &quot;(river) mouth of the ford&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot;/&gt; This sandbar was formed at the confluence of two rivers at what is now Donegall Quay: the [[River Lagan|Lagan]], which flows into Belfast Lough, and its tributary the [[River Farset|Farset]]. This area was the hub around which the original settlement developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/archive/places/a-town-is-born-four-hundred-years-ago-belfast-officially-became-a-town-and-so-began-an-unlikely-success-story-29223858.html|title=A town is born; Four hundred years ago Belfast officially became a town and so began an unlikely success story|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-06|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106123008/https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/archive/places/a-town-is-born-four-hundred-years-ago-belfast-officially-became-a-town-and-so-began-an-unlikely-success-story-29223858.html|archive-date=6 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish name ''{{lang|ga|Béal Feirste}}'' is shared by a [[townland]] in [[County Mayo]], whose name has been anglicised as ''Belfarsad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfarsad |publisher=Logainm.ie |accessdate=13 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816184830/http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of the name is &quot;mouth of [the river] of the sandbar&quot;, an allusion to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. This interpretation was favoured by [[Edmund Hogan]] and [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Onomasticon Goedelicum |last=Hogan |first=Edmund |year=1910 |location=Dublin |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B |access-date=1 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717183101/http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B |archive-date=17 July 2011 |url-status = live}}; {{Cite book |title=Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland |last=O'Donovan |first=John |year=1856 |location=Dublin |url=https://archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up |access-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151447/http://www.archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear, however, that the river itself was named after the tidal crossing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot;/&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:DV405 no.227 Castle Place, Belfast.png|thumb|Castle Place, Belfast, c.1830]]

The site of Belfast has been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Giants Ring, Belfast|Giant's Ring]], a 5,000-year-old [[henge]], is located near the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A walk on the outskirts of Belfast: Giant's Ring Trail, Northern Ireland |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 May 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/giants-ring-trail-belfast-walk |accessdate=1 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030002902/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/giants-ring-trail-belfast-walk |archive-date=30 October 2013 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remains of [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the [[High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. [[John de Courcy]] built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as [[Carrickfergus Castle]] to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]] clan had a presence in the area.

In the 14th century, Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, descendants of Aodh Buidhe O'Neill, built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Komesu | first = Okifumi | title = Irish Writers and Politics | page = 73 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | url = https://books.google.com/?id=AwFO2Z8Bk0YC&amp;pg=PA73 | year= 1990 | isbn = 978-0-389-20926-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conn O'Neill of the Clannaboy O'Neills owned vast lands in the area and was the last inhabitant of Grey Castle, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |title=Celebrations mark the arrival of first Ulster Scots in Ireland |newspaper=Irish News |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=18 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927114138/http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as a town by [[Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]].&lt;ref name=&quot;belfast castle history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Belfast Castle |website=Tourism and venues |publisher=[[Belfast City Council]] |year=2014 |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/belfastcastle/bchistory.aspx |accessdate=19 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519235252/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/belfastcastle/bchistory.aspx |archive-date=19 May 2014 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially settled by Protestant English and Scottish migrants at the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. (Belfast and County Antrim, however, did not form part of this particular Plantation scheme as they were privately colonised.) In 1791, the [[Society of United Irishmen]] was founded in Belfast, after [[Henry Joy McCracken]] and other prominent [[Presbyterians]] from the city invited [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]] to a meeting, after having read Tone's &quot;Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connolly&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Divided Kingdom; Ireland 1630–1800 |first=Sean J. |last=Connolly |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-958387-4 |pages=434–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the [[The Belfast Entries|Entries]].

Belfast blossomed as a commercial and industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland's pre-eminent industrial city. Industries thrived, including linen, rope-making, tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and at the end of the 19th century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the largest city in Ireland. The Harland and Wolff shipyards became one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, employing up to 35,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3176184.stm |title=Cranes to remain on city skyline |work=[[BBC News]] |date=9 October 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115140659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3176184.stm |archive-date=15 January 2009 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 the city suffered [[1886 Belfast riots|intense riots]] over the issue of home rule, which had divided the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryland |first=Frederick |authorlink= |title=Events of the Reign 1837–1897 |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen]] |year=1897 |location=London |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lw4QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 |oclc=267093697 |access-date=16 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231214225/https://books.google.com/books?id=lw4QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 |archive-date=31 December 2015 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920–22, Belfast became the capital of the new entity of Northern Ireland as the island of [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland was partitioned]]. The accompanying conflict (the [[Irish War of Independence]]) cost up to 500 lives in Belfast, the bloodiest sectarian strife in the city until the Troubles of the late 1960s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Robert.

Belfast was [[Belfast Blitz|heavily bombed]] during [[World War II]]. Initial raids were a surprise as the city was believed to be outside of the range of German bomber planes. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Apart from London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=The Belfast blitz is remembered |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111212052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |archive-date=11 January 2009 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Troubles===
{{Main|The Troubles}}
Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] respectively, although they are also loosely referred to as '[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]' and '[[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]]'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles – a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trouble history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelters |first=Seamus |title=Violence in the Troubles |website=History |publisher=BBC |date=February 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |accessdate=19 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shankilltroubles.jpg|thumb|[[Shankill Road]] during the Troubles, 1970s]]
Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The [[Provisional IRA]] detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre on 21 July 1972, on what is known as &quot;[[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]]&quot;, killing nine people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|IRA campaign]]. Most of their victims were Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ó Dochartaigh | first = Niall | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = From Civil Rights To Armalites | publisher = [[Cork University Press]] | year = 1999 | page = 292 | isbn = 978-1-85918-108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly notorious group, based on the [[Shankill Road]] in the mid-1970s, became known as the [[Shankill Butchers]].

===Local government===
{{Details|Belfast City Council}}

Belfast City Council is the [[Local government in Northern Ireland|local council]] with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]], Deputy Lord Mayor and [[High Sheriff]] who are elected from among 60 [[councillors]]. The first Lord Mayor of Belfast was Daniel Dixon, who was elected in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast City Council – Lord Mayor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Councillors: Lord Mayor |publisher=Belfast City Council |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor |accessdate=24 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607193627/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor |archivedate=7 June 2007 |url-status = dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord Mayor]] for 2019–20 is John Finucane [[Sinn Féin]], while the Deputy Lord Mayor is an [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] councillor. The Lord Mayor's duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast City Council – Lord Mayor&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Belfast City Hall 2.jpg|thumb|Belfast City Hall]]
In 1997, [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] gaining the balance of power between [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] and Unionists. This position was confirmed in four subsequent council elections, with mayors from Sinn Féin and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), both of whom are Nationalist parties, and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1997.

As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], the site of the [[Devolution#Northern Ireland|devolved]] legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliamentary]] constituencies: [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]], [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]], [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast South]] and [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]]. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] districts. In the [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2017]], Belfast elected 20 [[Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs), 5 from each [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|constituency]].

Belfast is at the western end of Belfast Lough and at the mouth of the River Lagan giving it the ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' was built in Belfast in 1911–1912, Harland and Wolff had the largest shipyard in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titanic In History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction To Titanic – Titanic in History |website=Titanic.

Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern [[coast]] at {{Coord|54|35|49|N|05|55|45|W}}. A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the [[winter solstice]], the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the [[Solstice|summer solstice]] in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sunrise and sunset in Belfast | website = Sun Calculator | publisher = time and date.com | url = http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/uk/belfast | accessdate = 18 May 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724071927/http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/uk/belfast | archive-date = 24 July 2014 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[River Farset]] is also named after this [[silt]] deposit (from the Irish ''feirste'' meaning &quot;sand spit&quot;). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]] referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belfast City: Did you know? |website=Discover Ireland |publisher=Tourism Ireland |year=2007 |url=http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ |accessdate=18 May 2007 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125051/http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Superseded by the River Lagan as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street. There are no less than eleven other minor rivers in and around Belfast, namely the Blackstaff, the Colin, the Connswater, the Cregagh, the Derriaghy, the Forth, the Knock, the Legoniel, the Milewater, the Purdysburn and the Ravernet.&lt;ref&gt;Des O'Reilly, [http://www.colourpointbooks.co.uk/more_details.php?id=1016 Rivers of Belfast – A History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723042224/http://www.colourpointbooks.co.uk/more_details.php?id=1016 |date=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
As with the vast majority of the rest of Ireland, Belfast has a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]), with a narrow range of temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. The climate of Belfast is significantly milder than most other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. There are currently five weather observing stations in the Belfast area: Helens Bay, Stormont, Newforge, Castlereagh, and Ravenhill Road. Slightly further afield is Aldergrove Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes|title=Station Locations|accessdate=23 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603030136/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest temperature recorded at any official weather station in the Belfast area was {{convert|30.8|C|F}} at Shaws Bridge on 12 July 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Met Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Climate: Northern Ireland | publisher = Met Office | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/ni | accessdate = 25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belfast holds the record for Northern Ireland's warmest night time minimum, {{convert|19.6|C|F}} at Whitehouse on 14 August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes|title=2001 Minimum|accessdate=23 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603030136/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as &quot;[[peace lines]]&quot;, erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacelines&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

Belfast city centre is divided into two postcode districts, ''BT1'' for the area lying north of the City Hall, and ''BT2'' for the area to its south. The industrial estate and docklands ''BT3''. The rest of the Belfast [[post town]] is divided in a broadly [[clockwise]] system from ''BT3'' in the north-east round to ''BT15'', with ''BT16'' and ''BT17'' further out to the east and west respectively. Although ''BT'' derives from ''Belfast'', the [[BT postcode area]] extends across the whole of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The UK Postcode System |publisher=List Masters |year=2005 |url=http://www.listmasters.co.uk/postcodes.php |accessdate=12 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624020159/http://www.listmasters.co.uk/postcodes.php |archivedate=24 June 2007 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, boosted by increasing numbers of tourists, the city council has developed a number of cultural [[Belfast quarters|quarters]].

[[File:Obel Tower completed.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Obel Tower]] is the tallest building in Belfast and Ireland.]]

The architectural style of Belfast's public buildings range from a small set of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings, many examples of  [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], including the main ''Lanyon Building'' at [[Queen's University Belfast]] and the [[Linenhall Library]], (both designed by [[Charles Lanyon|Sir Charles Lanyon]]).

Belfast is a relatively car-dependent city by European standards, with an extensive road network including the {{convert|22.5|mi|km|0}} [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] and [[M22 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M22 motorway]] route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/m2.html|title=M2 / M22 Motorway|publisher=Wesleyjohnston.com|accessdate=12 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012656/http://wesleyjohnston.com/roads/m2.html|archive-date=4 December 2010|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 survey of how people travel in Northern Ireland showed that people in Belfast made 77% of all journeys by car, 11% by public transport and 6% on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel Survey&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency |title=Travel Survey for Northern Ireland 2002–04 |publisher=Department for Regional Development |date=18 October 2005 |url=http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=161 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519124721/http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=161 |archivedate=19 May 2007 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed that Belfast has 0.70 cars per household compared to figures of 1.18 in the East and 1.14 in the West of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel Survey&quot;/&gt; A road improvement-scheme in Belfast began early in 2006, with the upgrading of two junctions along the [[Westlink Belfast|Westlink]] dual-carriageway to [[grade separation|grade-separated]] standard.

Bus and rail public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]]. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by [[Metro (Belfast)|Translink Metro]], with services focusing on linking residential districts with the city centre on 12 [[quality bus corridor]]s running along main radial roads,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Metro Corridor &amp; Zone Guide |publisher=[[Metro (Belfast)|Translink Metro]] |date=27 August 2012 |url=http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Metro-Service-Page/Metro-Corridor-Zone-Guide |accessdate=2 June 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711034346/http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Metro-Service-Page/Metro-Corridor-Zone-Guide/ |archivedate=11 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More distant suburbs are served by [[Ulsterbus]]. [[Northern Ireland Railways]] provides [[Belfast Suburban Rail|suburban services]] along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to [[Carrickfergus]], [[Larne]] and [[Larne Harbour railway station|Larne Harbour]], eastwards towards [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and south-westwards towards [[Lisburn]] and [[Portadown railway station|Portadown]]. This service is known as the [[Belfast Suburban Rail]] system. Belfast is linked [[Belfast-Derry railway line|directly]] to [[Coleraine railway station|Coleraine]], [[Portrush railway station|Portrush]] and [[Londonderry railway station|Derry]]. Belfast has a direct rail connection with [[Dublin]] called ''[[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]]'' which is operated jointly by NIR and [[Iarnród Éireann]], the state railway company of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. There are no rail services to cities in other countries of the United Kingdom, due to the [[Irish Sea fixed crossing|lack of a bridge or tunnel]] connecting [[Great Britain]] to the island of Ireland. There is, however, a combined ferry and rail ticket between Belfast and cities in Great Britain, which is referred to as ''Sailrail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seat61.com/NorthernIreland.htm|title=London to Belfast by train &amp; ferry from £55|website=Seat61.com|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909133736/https://www.seat61.com/NorthernIreland.htm|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the [[Department for Regional Development]] reported on a plan for a light-rail system, similar to that in [[Dublin]]. The consultants said Belfast does not have the population to support a light rail system, suggesting that investment in bus-based rapid transit would be preferable. The study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results, but light rail does not. The report by Atkins &amp; KPMG, however, said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7336800/7336822.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;bbcws=1 |title=video No light rail system for city |work=BBC News |date=8 April 2008 |accessdate=30 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203825/http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7336800/7336822.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;bbcws=1 |archive-date=24 March 2012 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = City to get rapid transit network | work = BBC Northern Ireland | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| accessdate = 4 April 2008 | date=8 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409114158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| archivedate= 9 April 2008 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has two airports: [[Belfast International Airport]] offering, domestic, European and international flights such as Orlando operated seasonally by [[Virgin Atlantic]]. The airport is located northwest of the city, near Lough Neagh, while the [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], which is closer to the city centre by train from [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] on the [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] Line, adjacent to Belfast Lough, offers UK domestic flights and a few European flights. In 2005, Belfast International Airport was the 11th busiest commercial airport in the UK, accounting for just over 2% of all UK terminal passengers while the George Best Belfast City Airport was the 16th busiest and had 1% of UK terminal passengers. The Belfast – Liverpool route is the busiest domestic flight route in the UK excluding London with 555,224 passengers in 2009.

Belfast has a large [[Port of Belfast|port]] used for exporting and importing goods, and for passenger ferry services. [[Stena Line]] runs regular routes to [[Cairnryan]] in Scotland using its conventional vessels—with a crossing time of around 2 hours 15 minutes. Until 2011 the route went to [[Stranraer]] and used inter alia a HSS (High Speed Service) vessel—with a crossing time of around 90 minutes. Stena Line also operates a route to [[Liverpool]]. A seasonal sailing to [[Douglas, Isle of Man]] is operated by the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet|Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]].

A new form of transport in Belfast was created in 2018 known as the 'Glider'. It is Belfast's new rapid transit which came into operation on 3 September 2018. The Glider links East Belfast, West Belfast and the Titanic Quarter from the City Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/belfast-rapid-transit-glider-introduction|website=Infrastructure-ni.gov.uk|accessdate=15 May 2018|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515141539/https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/belfast-rapid-transit-glider-introduction|archive-date=15 May 2018|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belfast's population is evenly split between its Protestant and Catholic residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Urban Area&quot;/&gt; These two distinct cultural communities have both contributed significantly to the city's culture.

Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the [[Gaeltacht]], the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational transmission. Due to community activity in the 1960s, including the establishment of the [[Shaw's Road|Shaws Road Gaeltacht]] community, the expanse in the Irish language arts, and the advancements made in the availability of Irish medium education throughout the city, it can now be said that there is a 'mother-tongue' community of speakers.{{Dubious|date=November 2010}} The language is heavily promoted in the city and is particularly visible in the Falls Road area, where the signs on both the iconic black taxis and on the public buses are bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbairtfeirste.com/forbairt-news/comharthai-bus-gaeilge-san-iarthar-irish-language-bus-signs-in-the-west/ |title=ComharthaÃ Bus Gaeilge san Iarthar / Irish language bus signs in the West &amp;#124; Here comes the new Belfast |publisher=Forbairtfeirste.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227211258/http://www.forbairtfeirste.com/forbairt-news/comharthai-bus-gaeilge-san-iarthar-irish-language-bus-signs-in-the-west/ |archive-date=27 February 2015 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belfast has the highest concentration of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Projects to promote the language in the city are funded by various sources, notably [[Foras na Gaeilge]], an all-Ireland body funded by both the Irish and British governments. There are a number of Irish language Primary schools and one secondary school in Belfast. The provision of certain resources for these schools (for example, such as the provision of textbooks) is supported by the charitable organisation TACA.

In late August 2018, at least three groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 [[RMS Titanic]] relics that were an asset of the bankrupt [[Premier Exhibitions]]. One of the offers was by a group including the [[National Maritime Museum]] and [[National Museums Northern Ireland]], with assistance by [[James Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Dawn McCarty |author2=Jef Feeley |author3=Chris Dixon |title=James Cameron: Getting Titanic Artifacts to U.K. Would Be 'a Dream' |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/07/news-titanic-uk-belfast-bankruptcy-cameron/ |magazine=National Geographic |date=24 July 2018 |accessdate=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902220610/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/07/news-titanic-uk-belfast-bankruptcy-cameron/ |archive-date=2 September 2018 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceanographer [[Robert Ballard]] said he favored this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where the Titanic was built) and in [[Greenwich]].
