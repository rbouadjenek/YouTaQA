The '''Achaeans''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|iː|ən|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀχαιοί}} ''Akhaioí,'' &quot;the Achaeans&quot; or &quot;of Achaea&quot;) constitute one of the [[Names of the Greeks|collective names]] for the [[Greeks]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' (used 598 times) and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The other common names are '''Danaans''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|n|eɪ|.|ən|z}}; {{lang|grc|Δαναοί}} ''Danaoi''; used 138 times in the ''Iliad'') and '''Argives''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|aɪ|v|z}}; {{lang|grc|Ἀργεῖοι}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Argeioi}}; used 182 times in the ''Iliad'') while '''Panhellenes''' ({{lang|grc|Πανέλληνες}} ''Panhellenes,'' &quot;All of the Greeks&quot;) and '''Hellenes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|iː|n|z}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hellene &quot;Hellene&quot;] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|grc|Ἕλληνες}} ''Hellenes'') both [[hapax legomenon|appear only once]];&lt;ref&gt;See ''Iliad'', II.2.530 for &quot;Panhellenes&quot; and ''Iliad'' II.2.653 for &quot;Hellenes&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; all of the aforementioned terms were used synonymously to denote a common Greek civilizational identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartledge|2011|loc=Chapter 4: Argos, p. 23: &quot;The Late Bronze Age in Greece is also called conventionally 'Mycenaean', as we saw in the last chapter. But it might in principle have been called 'Argive', 'Achaean', or 'Danaan', since the three names that Homer does apply to Greeks collectively were 'Argives', 'Achaeans', and 'Danaans'.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|2014|loc=Texts and Commentaries – Introduction #2: &quot;Panhellenism is the least common denominator of ancient Greek civilization...The impulse of Panhellenism is already at work in Homeric and Hesiodic poetry. In the Iliad, the names &quot;Achaeans&quot; and &quot;Danaans&quot; and &quot;Argives&quot; are used synonymously in the sense of Panhellenes = &quot;all Hellenes&quot; = &quot;all Greeks.&quot;&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the historical period, the '''Achaeans''' were the inhabitants of the region of [[Achaea (ancient region)#Name|Achaea]], a region in the north-central part of the [[Peloponnese]]. The city-states of this region later formed a confederation known as the [[Achaean League]], which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.

==Homeric versus later use==
The Homeric &quot;long-haired Achaeans&quot; would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from circa 1600 BC until 1100 BC. Later, by the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods, the term &quot;Achaeans&quot; referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]]. [[Herodotus]] identified the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]] of the northern [[Peloponnese]] as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], writing in the 2nd century CE, the term &quot;Achaean&quot; was originally given to those Greeks inhabiting the [[Argolis]] and [[Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', VII.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausanias and Herodotus both recount the legend that the Achaeans were forced from their homelands by the [[Dorians]], during the legendary [[Dorian invasion]] of the Peloponnese. They then moved into the region later called Achaea.

A scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic Achaeans relative to the Homeric Achaeans and is still hotly debated. Former emphasis on presumed race, such as John A. Scott's article about the blond locks of the Achaeans as compared to the dark locks of &quot;Mediterranean&quot; [[Poseidon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1925|pp=366–367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of hints in Homer, has been rejected by some. The contrasting belief that &quot;Achaeans&quot;, as understood through Homer, is &quot;a name without a country&quot;, an ''ethnos'' created in the [[Epic Cycle|Epic tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;As William K. Prentice expressed this long-standing skepticism of a genuine Achaean ethnicity in the distant past, at the outset of his article &quot;The Achaeans&quot; (see {{harvnb|Prentice|1929|p=206}}).&lt;/ref&gt; has modern supporters among those who conclude that &quot;Achaeans&quot; were redefined in the 5th century BC, as contemporary speakers of [[Aeolic Greek]].

[[Karl Beloch]] suggested there was no Dorian invasion, but rather that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beloch|1893|loc=Volume I, pp. 88 (Note #1) and 92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Meyer]], disagreeing with Beloch, instead put forth the suggestion that the real-life Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|1884–1902|loc=Volume II, Part 1: Die Zeit der ägyptischen Großmacht –  [http://www.zeno.org/Geschichte/M/Meyer,+Eduard/Geschichte+des+Altertums/Zweiter+Band.+Erste+Abteilung%3A+Die+Zeit+der+%C3%A4gyptischen+Gro%C3%9Fmacht/V.+Das+griechische+Festland+und+die+mykenische+Kultur V. Das griechische Festland und die mykenische Kultur]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the Achaeans and pre-historic Arcadians. William Prentice disagreed with both, noting archeological evidence suggests the Achaeans instead migrated from &quot;southern [[Asia Minor]] to Greece, probably settling first in lower [[Ancient Thessaly|Thessaly]]&quot; probably prior to 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prentice|1929|pp=206–218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hittite documents==
[[Emil Forrer]], a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] Hittitologist who worked on the Boghazköy tablets in [[Berlin]], said the Achaeans of pre-Homeric Greece were directly associated with the term &quot;Land of Ahhiyawa&quot; mentioned in the Hittite texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Güterbock&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Güterbock|1984|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusions at the time were challenged by other Hittitologists (i.e. [[Johannes Friedrich (linguist)|Johannes Friedrich]] in 1927 and [[Albrecht Goetze|Albrecht Götze]] in 1930), as well as by Ferdinand Sommer, who published his ''Die Ahhijava-Urkunden'' (&quot;The Ahhiyawa Documents&quot;) in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Güterbock&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Map Hittite rule en.svg|thumb|175px|left|Map showing the Hittite Empire, Ahhiyawa (Achaeans) and Wilusa (Troy) in c. 1300 BC.]]

Some [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts mention a nation lying to the west called '''''Ahhiyawa'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1960|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Güterbock|1983|pp=133–138}}; {{harvnb|Mellink|1983|pp=138–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest reference to this land, a letter outlining the treaty violations of the Hittite vassal [[Madduwatta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fCTH147_Madduwatta.html Translation of the Sins of Madduwatta]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228042849/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FCTH147_Madduwatta.html |date=February 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is called ''Ahhiya''. Another important example is the ''[[Tawagalawa Letter]]'' written by an unnamed [[Hittites|Hittite]] king (most probably [[Hattusili III]]) of the empire period (14th–13th century BC) to the king of ''Ahhiyawa'', treating him as an equal and implying [[Miletus]] (''Millawanda'') was under his control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fPiyama-radu+Letter.html Translation of the Tawagalawa Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021192729/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FPiyama-radu+Letter.html |date=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to an earlier &quot;''Wilusa'' episode&quot; involving hostility on the part of ''Ahhiyawa''. Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the [[Trojan War]] and the city of [[Wilusa]] with the legendary city of [[Troy]] (note the similarity with early Greek {{lang|grc|Ϝίλιον}} ''Wilion'', later {{lang|grc|Ἴλιον}} ''Ilion'', the name of the [[acropolis]] of Troy). The exact relationship of the term ''Ahhiyawa'' to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation was hotly debated by scholars, even following the discovery that Mycenaean [[Linear B]] is an early form of Greek; the earlier debate was summed up in 1984 by [[Hans G. Güterbock]] of the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Güterbock|1984|pp=114–122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, as well as of the material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that ''Ahhiyawa'' referred to the Mycenaean world, or at least to a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Windle|2004|pp=121–122}}; {{harvnb|Bryce|1999|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egyptian sources==
[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumb|175px|right|Map of Mycenaean cultural areas, 1400-1100 BC (unearthed sites in red dots).]]
It has been proposed that ''Ekwesh'' of the Egyptian records may relate to ''Achaea'' (compared to Hittite ''Ahhiyawa''), whereas ''[[Denyen]]'' and ''Tanaju'' may relate to Classical Greek ''Danaoi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelder125–126&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=125–126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest textual reference to the Mycenaean world is in the Annals of [[Thutmosis III]] (ca. 1479–1425 BC), which refers to messengers from the king of the Tanaju, circa 1437 BC, offering greeting gifts to the Egyptian king, in order to initiate diplomatic relations, when the latter campaigned in Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelder125–126&quot;/&gt; Tanaju is also listed in an inscription at the [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III]]. The latter ruled Egypt in circa 1382–1344 BC. Moreover, a list of the cities and regions of the Tanaju is also mentioned in this inscription; among the cities listed are Mycenae, [[Nauplion]], [[Kythera]], [[Messenia]] and the Thebaid (region of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelder125–126&quot;/&gt;

During the 5th year of Pharaoh [[Merneptah]], a confederation of [[Libya]]n and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the western delta. Included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the [[Ekwesh]] or Eqwesh, whom some have seen as Achaeans, although Egyptian texts specifically mention these Ekwesh to be [[circumcised]] (which does not seem to have been a general practice in the Aegean at the time). Homer mentions an Achaean attack upon the delta, and [[Menelaus]] speaks of the same in Book IV of the ''Odyssey'' to [[Telemachus]] when he recounts his own return home from the [[Trojan War]]. Later Greek myths also say Helen had spent the time of the Trojan War in [[Egypt]], and not at [[Troy]], and that after Troy the [[Greeks]] went there to recover her.

==Greek mythology==
In [[Greek mythology]], the perceived cultural divisions among the Hellenes were represented as legendary lines of descent that identified kinship groups, with each line being derived from an [[eponymy|eponymous]] ancestor. Each of the Greek ''[[Ethnic group|ethne]]'' were said to be named in honor of their respective ancestors: [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]] of the Achaeans, [[Danaus]] of the Danaans, [[Cadmus]] of the Cadmeans ([[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|the Thebans]]), [[Hellen]] of the Hellenes (not to be confused with [[Helen of Troy]]), [[Aeolus]] of the [[Aeolians]], [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] of the [[Ionians]], and [[Dorus]] of the [[Dorians]].

Cadmus from [[Phoenicia]], Danaus from [[Egypt]], and Pelops from [[Anatolia]] each gained a foothold in mainland Greece and were assimilated and Hellenized. Hellen, Graikos, Magnes, and Macedon were sons of [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], the only people who survived the [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Great Flood]];&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Catalogue of Women'', Fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''ethne'' were said to have originally been named ''Graikoi'' after the elder son but later renamed ''Hellenes'' after Hellen who was proved to be the strongest.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Meteorologica'', I.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of Hellen and the nymph [[Orseis]] were Dorus, Xuthos, and [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pseudo-Apollodorus&quot;&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html I.7.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of Xuthos and Kreousa, daughter of Erechthea, were Ion and Achaeus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pseudo-Apollodorus&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Hyginus]], 22 Achaeans killed 362 Trojans during their ten years at [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]]. ''[[Fabulae]]'',  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html#114 114].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In particular: Achilles 72, Antilochus 2, Protesilaus 4, Peneleos 2, Eurypylus 1, Ajax 14, Thoas 2, Leitus 20, Thrasymedes 2, Agamemnon 16, Diomedes 18, Menelaus 8, Philoctetes 3, Meriones 7, Odysseus 12, Idomeneus 13, Leonteus 5, Ajax 28, Patroclus 54, Polypoetes 1, Teucer 30, Neoptolemus 6; a total of 362 Trojans.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genealogy of the Argives===
{{Argive genealogy in Greek mythology}}

==Etymology==
According to [[Margalit Finkelberg]], the name Ἀχαιοί/Ἀχαιϝοί is derived from [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''Aḫḫiyawā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelberg|1988|pp=127–134}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] doubted the validity of this derivation and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] proto-form ''*Akay&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;a-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|2010|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymology of ''Danaoi'' is uncertain; according to Beekes, &quot;the name is certainly [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Greek]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|2010|p=302}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
