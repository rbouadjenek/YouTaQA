==Naming==
[[File:Meissner alkalod definition article 1819.png|thumb|160px|The article that introduced the concept of &quot;alkaloid&quot;.]]

The name &quot;alkaloids&quot; ({{lang-de|Alkaloide|links=no}}) was introduced in 1819 by the German chemist [[:de:Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Meißner|Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Meißner]], and is derived from late Latin root {{lang|la|alkali}} (which, in turn, comes from the Arabic {{lang|ar|al-qalwī}} meaning 'ashes of plants') and the suffix {{lang|grc|-οειδής}} -('like').&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt; In the penultimate sentence of his article, W. Meissner (1819) &quot;Über Pflanzenalkalien: II. Über ein neues Pflanzenalkali (Alkaloid)&quot; (On plant alkalis: II. On a new plant alkali (alkaloid)), ''Journal für Chemie und Physik'', '''25''' : 379–381 ; available on-line at:  [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433069069056;view=1up;seq=415 Hathi Trust] – Meissner wrote:  &quot;{{lang|de|Überhaupt scheint es mir auch angemessen, die bis jetzt bekannten Pflanzenstoffe nicht mit dem Namen Alkalien, sondern Alkaloide zu belegen, da sie doch in manchen Eigenschaften von den Alkalien sehr abweichen, sie würden daher in dem Abschnitt der Pflanzenchemie vor den Pflanzensäuren ihre Stelle finden}}.&quot; ( I. e, ''In general, it seems appropriate to me to impose on the currently known plant substances not the name &quot;alkalis&quot; but &quot;alkaloids&quot;, since they differ greatly in some properties from the alkalis; among the chapters of plant chemistry, they would therefore find their place before plant acids [since &quot;Alkaloid&quot; would precede &quot;Säure&quot; (acid) but follow &quot;Alkalien&quot;].)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term came into wide use only after the publication of a review article, by Oscar Jacobsen in the chemical dictionary of [[Albert Ladenburg]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Jacobsen, &quot;Alkaloide&quot; in:  Ladenburg, ''Handwörterbuch der Chemie'' (Breslau, Germany:  Eduard Trewendt, 1882), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-9fUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 pp. 213–422].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no unique method for naming alkaloids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 5&quot;&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many individual names are formed by adding the suffix &quot;ine&quot; to the species or genus name.&lt;ref&gt;The suffix &quot;ine&quot; is a Greek feminine patronymic suffix and means &quot;daughter of&quot;; hence, for example, &quot;atropine&quot; means &quot;daughter of Atropa&quot; (belladonna): [https://webspace.yale.edu/chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html Development of Systematic Names for the Simple Alkanes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316080546/https://webspace.yale.edu/chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html# |date=2012-03-16 }}. yale.edu&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[atropine]] is isolated from the plant ''[[Atropa belladonna]]''; [[strychnine]] is obtained from the seed of the [[Strychnine tree]]  (''Strychnos nux-vomica'' L.).&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;/&gt; Where several alkaloids are extracted from one plant their names are often distinguished by variations in the  suffix: &quot;idine&quot;, &quot;anine&quot;, &quot;aline&quot;, &quot;inine&quot; etc. There are also at least 86 alkaloids whose names contain the root &quot;vin&quot; because they are extracted from ''[[vinca]]'' plants such as ''Vinca rosea'' (''[[Catharanthus roseus]]'');&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; these are called [[vinca alkaloid|''vinca'' alkaloids]].&lt;ref name = CurrMedChem-VA&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = van der Heijden|first1 = Robert|last2 = Jacobs|first2 = Denise I.|last3 = Snoeijer|first3 = Wim|last4 = Hallard|first4 = Didier|last5 = Verpoorte|first5 = Robert|year = 2004|title = The ''Catharanthus'' alkaloids: Pharmacognosy and biotechnology|journal = [[Current Medicinal Chemistry]]|volume = 11|issue = 5|pages = 607–628|pmid = 15032608|doi = 10.2174/0929867043455846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Africa's gift to the world|pages = 46–51|chapter-url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aXGmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|title = Botanical Miracles: Chemistry of Plants That Changed the World|first1 = Raymond|last1 = Cooper|first2 = Jeffrey John|last2 = Deakin|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|year = 2016|isbn = 9781498704304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Raviña|first = Enrique|title = The evolution of drug discovery: From traditional medicines to modern drugs|year = 2011|publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn = 9783527326693|pages = 157–159|chapter = Vinca alkaloids|chapter-url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=iDNy0XxGqT8C&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertuerner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Sertürner]], the German chemist who first isolated morphine from opium.]]
Alkaloid-containing plants have been used by humans since ancient times for therapeutic and recreational purposes. For example, medicinal plants have been known in [[Mesopotamia]] from about 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aniszewski 182&quot;&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Odyssey]]'' of Homer referred to a gift given to Helen by the Egyptian queen, a drug bringing oblivion. It is believed that the gift was an opium-containing drug.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese book on houseplants written in 1st–3rd centuries BC mentioned a medical use of [[ephedra]] and [[opium poppies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[coca]] leaves have been used by South American Indians since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracts from plants containing toxic alkaloids, such as [[aconitine]] and [[tubocurarine]], were used since antiquity for poisoning arrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aniszewski 182&quot;/&gt;

Studies of alkaloids began in the 19th century. In 1804, the German chemist [[Friedrich Sertürner]] isolated from opium a &quot;soporific principle&quot; ({{lang-la|principium somniferum|links=no}}), which he called &quot;morphium&quot;, referring to [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], the Greek god of dreams; in German and some other Central-European languages, this is still the name of the drug. The term &quot;morphine&quot;, used in English and French, was given by the French physicist [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]].

A significant contribution to the chemistry of alkaloids in the early years of its development was made by the French researchers [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]], who discovered [[quinine]] (1820) and [[strychnine]] (1818). Several other alkaloids were discovered around that time, including [[xanthine]] (1817), [[atropine]] (1819), [[caffeine]] (1820), [[coniine]] (1827), [[nicotine]] (1828), [[colchicine]] (1833), [[sparteine]] (1851), and [[cocaine]] (1860).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 313–316&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of the chemistry of alkaloids was accelerated by the emergence of [[spectroscopic]] and [[chromatographic]] methods in the 20th century, so that by 2008 more than 12,000 alkaloids had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Begley|Begley]], '' Natural Products in Plants''. &lt;/ref&gt;

The first complete synthesis of an alkaloid was achieved in 1886 by the German chemist [[Albert Ladenburg]]. He produced [[coniine]] by reacting 2-methylpyridine with [[acetaldehyde]] and [[oxidation-reduction reaction|reducing]] the resulting 2-propenyl pyridine with sodium.&lt;ref name=&quot;BSE: koniin&quot;&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00036/77600.htm Кониин]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1969–1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bufotenin.svg|thumb|160px|[[Bufotenin]], an alkaloid from some toads, contains an [[indole]] core, and is produced in living organisms from the amino acid [[tryptophan]].]]

== Classifications ==
[[File:Nicotine.svg|thumb|160px|The [[nicotine]] molecule contains both [[pyridine]] (left) and [[pyrrolidine]] rings (right).]]

Compared with most other classes of natural compounds, alkaloids are characterized by a great structural diversity.  There is no uniform classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref15&quot;&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, when knowledge of chemical structures was lacking, botanical classification of the source plants was relied on.  This classification is now considered obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Orekhov|Orekhov]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent classifications are based on similarity of the carbon skeleton (''e.g.'', [[indole]]-, [[isoquinoline]]-, and [[pyridine]]-like) or biochemical precursor ([[ornithine]], [[lysine]], [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;XimE: alkaloidy&quot;/&gt; However, they require compromises in borderline cases;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref15&quot; /&gt; for example, [[nicotine]] contains a pyridine fragment from [[nicotinamide]] and a [[pyrrolidine]] part from ornithine&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore can be assigned to both classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref19&quot;&gt;[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkaloids are often divided into the following major groups:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

# &quot;True alkaloids&quot; contain [[nitrogen]] in the [[heterocycle]] and originate from [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref  
name=&quot;ref21&quot;&gt;[[#Plemenkov|Plemenkov]], p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Their characteristic examples are [[atropine]], [[nicotine]], and [[morphine]]. This group also includes some alkaloids that besides the nitrogen heterocycle contain [[terpene]] (''e.g.'', [[evonine]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;) or peptide fragments (''e.g.'' [[ergotamine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ref23&quot;&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;). The piperidine alkaloids [[coniine]] and [[coniceine]] may be regarded as true alkaloids (rather than pseudoalkaloids: see below)&lt;ref name=&quot;ref24&quot;&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not originate from amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref25&quot;&gt;[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;Protoalkaloids&quot;, which contain [[nitrogen]] (but not the nitrogen heterocycle) and also originate from amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref21&quot; /&gt; Examples include [[mescaline]], [[adrenaline]] and [[ephedrine]].
# Polyamine alkaloids – derivatives of [[putrescine]], [[spermidine]], and [[spermine]].
# Peptide and cyclopeptide alkaloids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref27&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dimitris C. Gournelif |author2=Gregory G.

# Pseudoalkaloids – alkaloid-like compounds that do not originate from amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This group includes [[terpene]]-like and [[steroid]]-like alkaloids,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plemenkov|Plemenkov]], p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[purine]]-like alkaloids such as [[caffeine]], [[theobromine]], [[theacrine]] and [[theophylline]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref30&quot;&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors classify as pseudoalkaloids such compounds such as [[ephedrine]] and [[cathinone]]. Those originate from the amino acid [[phenylalanine]], but acquire their nitrogen atom not from the amino acid but through [[transamination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref30&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref31&quot;&gt;[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Some alkaloids do not have the carbon skeleton characteristic of their group. So, [[galanthamine]] and homoaporphines do not contain [[isoquinoline]] fragment, but are, in general, attributed to isoquinoline alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 44, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[[File:Cyclopelamb2.jpg|thumb|Head of a calf born to a cow that ate leaves of the [[Veratrum californicum|corn lily]] plant. The [[cyclopia]] in the calf is induced by the alkaloid [[cyclopamine]] present in the plant.]]
Most alkaloids contain oxygen in their molecular structure; those compounds are usually colorless crystals at ambient conditions. Oxygen-free alkaloids, such as [[nicotine]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120722120400/http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00052/84600.htm Никотин]. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1969–1978)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[coniine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BSE: koniin&quot;/&gt; are typically volatile, colorless, oily liquids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref222&quot;&gt;[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Some alkaloids are colored, like [[berberine]] (yellow) and [[sanguinarine]] (orange).&lt;ref name=&quot;ref222&quot; /&gt;

Most alkaloids are weak bases, but some, such as [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]], are [[amphoteric]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref225&quot;&gt;G. A. Spiller [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rgs_rVOceZwC&amp;pg=PA140 ''Caffeine''], CRC Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-8493-2647-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many alkaloids dissolve poorly in water but readily dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, such as [[diethyl ether]], [[chloroform]] or [[1,2-dichloroethane]]. [[Caffeine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caffeine|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00201|work=DrugBank|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cocaine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cocaine|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00907|work=DrugBank|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[codeine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codeine|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00318|work=DrugBank|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nicotine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicotine|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184|work=DrugBank|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are slightly soluble in water (with a solubility of ≥1g/L), whereas others, including [[morphine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morphine|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00295|work=DrugBank|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[yohimbine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yohimbine |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01392 |work=DrugBank |accessdate=12 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130101146/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01392 |archivedate=30 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are very slightly water-soluble (0.1–1 g/L). Alkaloids and acids form salts of various strengths. These salts are usually freely soluble in water and [[ethanol]] and poorly soluble in most organic solvents. Exceptions include [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] hydrobromide, which is soluble in organic solvents, and the water-soluble quinine sulfate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref222&quot; /&gt;

Most alkaloids have a bitter taste or are poisonous when ingested. Alkaloid production in plants appeared to have evolved in response to feeding by herbivorous animals; however, some animals have evolved the ability to detoxify alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fattorusso|Fattorusso]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Some alkaloids can produce developmental defects in the offspring of animals that consume but cannot detoxify the alkaloids.  One example is the alkaloid [[cyclopamine]], produced in the leaves of [[Veratrum californicum|corn lily]]. During the 1950s, up to 25% of lambs born by sheep that had grazed on corn lily had serious facial deformations. These ranged from deformed jaws to [[cyclopia]] (see picture). After decades of research, in the 1980s, the compound responsible for these deformities was identified as the alkaloid 11-deoxyjervine, later renamed to cyclopamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nixyqfGIGHcC&amp;pg=PA362|title=Poisonous plants and related toxins, Volume 2001|author1=Thomas Acamovic |author2=Colin S. Stewart |author3=T. W. Pennycott |publisher=CABI|year= 2004|isbn=978-0-85199-614-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution in nature==
[[File:Strychnos nux-vomica - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-266.jpg|thumb|[[Strychnine tree]]. Its seeds are rich in [[strychnine]] and [[brucine]].]]

Alkaloids are [[anabolism|generated]] by various living organisms, especially by [[Vascular plant|higher plants]]&amp;nbsp;– about 10 to 25% of those contain alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Orekhov|Orekhov]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the past the term &quot;alkaloid&quot; was associated with plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 4&quot;&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The alkaloids content in plants is usually within a few percent and is inhomogeneous over the plant tissues. Depending on the type of plants, the maximum concentration is observed in the leaves ([[black henbane]]), [[fruit]]s or [[seed]]s ([[Strychnine tree]]), root (''[[Rauvolfia serpentina]]'') or bark ([[cinchona]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Orekhov|Orekhov]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside plants, alkaloids are found in certain types of [[fungi]], such as [[psilocybin]] in the fungus of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'', and in animals, such as [[bufotenin]] in the skin of some toads &lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 5&quot; /&gt; and a number of insects, markedly ants.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Touchard|first=Axel|last2=Aili|first2=Samira|last3=Fox|first3=Eduardo|last4=Escoubas|first4=Pierre|last5=Orivel|first5=Jérôme|last6=Nicholson|first6=Graham|last7=Dejean|first7=Alain|date=2016-01-20|title=The Biochemical Toxin Arsenal from Ant Venoms|journal=Toxins|volume=8|issue=1|pages=30|doi=10.3390/toxins8010030|pmid=26805882|pmc=4728552|issn=2072-6651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many marine organisms also contain alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fattorusso|Fattorusso]], p. XVII&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[amines]], such as [[adrenaline]] and [[serotonin]], which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraction==
[[File:Piperine crystals.jpg|thumb|Crystals of [[piperine]] extracted from [[black pepper]].]]

Because of the structural diversity of alkaloids, there is no single method of their extraction from natural raw materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Most methods exploit the property of most alkaloids to be soluble in organic solvents &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; but not in water, and the opposite tendency of their salts.

Most plants contain several alkaloids. Their mixture is extracted first and then individual alkaloids are separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref236&quot;&gt;[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are thoroughly ground before extraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Most alkaloids are present in the raw plants in the form of salts of organic acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;/&gt; The extracted alkaloids may remain salts or change into bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref236&quot; /&gt; Base extraction is achieved by processing the raw material with alkaline solutions and extracting the alkaloid bases with organic solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, diethyl ether or benzene. Then, the impurities are dissolved by weak acids; this converts alkaloid bases into salts that are washed away with water. If necessary, an aqueous solution of alkaloid salts is again made alkaline and treated with an organic solvent. The process is repeated until the desired purity is achieved.

In the acidic extraction, the raw plant material is processed by a weak acidic solution (''e.g.'', [[acetic acid]] in water, ethanol, or methanol). A base is then added to convert alkaloids to basic forms that are extracted with organic solvent (if the extraction was performed with alcohol, it is removed first, and the remainder is dissolved in water). The solution is purified as described above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse 116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], pp. 132–134&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkaloids are separated from their mixture using their different solubility in certain solvents and different reactivity with certain reagents or by [[distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], pp. 134–136&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of alkaloids are identified from [[insect]]s, among which the [[fire ant]] [[venom]] alkaloids known as [[solenopsin]]s have received greater attention from researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fox|first=Eduardo Gonçalves Paterson|title=Venom Toxins of Fire Ants|date=2016|work=Venom Genomics and Proteomics: Venom Genomics and Proteomics|pages=1–16|editor-last=Gopalakrishnakone|editor-first=P.|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-6649-5_38-1|isbn=9789400766495|editor2-last=Calvete|editor2-first=Juan J.|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insect alkaloids can be efficiently extracted by solvent immersion of live fire ants &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; or by centrifugation of live ants &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Eduardo G.

==Biosynthesis==
Biological precursors of most alkaloids are [[amino acid]]s, such as [[ornithine]], [[lysine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], [[histidine]], [[aspartic acid]], and [[anthranilic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plemenkov 253&quot;&gt;[[#Plemenkov|Plemenkov]], p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicotinic acid]] can be synthesized from tryptophan or aspartic acid. Ways of alkaloid biosynthesis are too numerous and cannot be easily classified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Begley&quot;/&gt; However, there are a few typical reactions involved in the biosynthesis of various classes of alkaloids, including synthesis of [[Schiff bases]] and [[Mannich reaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plemenkov 253&quot;/&gt;

===Synthesis of Schiff bases===
{{Main|Schiff base}}

Schiff bases can be obtained by reacting amines with ketones or aldehydes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plemenkov|Plemenkov]], p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions are a common method of producing C=N bonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewick 19&quot;&gt;[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schiff base formation.svg|center]]

In the biosynthesis of alkaloids, such reactions may take place within a molecule,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plemenkov 253&quot;/&gt; such as in the synthesis of piperidine:&lt;ref name=&quot;ref19&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Schiff base formation intramolecular.svg|center]]

===Mannich reaction===
{{Main|Mannich reaction}}

An integral component of the Mannich reaction, in addition to an amine and a [[carbonyl]] compound, is a [[carbanion]], which plays the role of the nucleophile in the [[nucleophilic addition]] to the ion formed by the reaction of the amine and the carbonyl.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dewick 19&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Mannich.png|center]]

The Mannich reaction can proceed both intermolecularly and intramolecularly:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plemenkov|Plemenkov]], p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mannich reaction intramolecular.svg|center]]

==Dimer alkaloids==
In addition to the described above monomeric alkaloids, there are also [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]ic, and even [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]]ic and [[tetramer]]ic alkaloids formed upon condensation of two, three, and four monomeric alkaloids. Dimeric alkaloids are usually formed from monomers of the same type through the following mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 91–105&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mannich reaction]], resulting in, ''e.g.'', voacamine
* [[Michael reaction]] (villalstonine)
* Condensation of aldehydes with amines (toxiferine)
* Oxidative addition of phenols (dauricine, tubocurarine)
* [[Lactone|Lactonization]] (carpaine).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

There are also dimeric alkaloids formed from two distinct monomers, such as the ''vinca'' alkaloids [[vinblastine]] and vincristine,&lt;ref name = CurrMedChem-VA /&gt;&lt;ref name = MoleculesReview&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Molecules (journal)|Molecules]]|year = 2012|volume = 17|issue = 5|pages = 5893–5914|doi = 10.3390/molecules17055893|title = Modifications on the basic skeletons of vinblastine and vincristine|first1 = Péter|last1 = Keglevich|first2 = Laszlo|last2 = Hazai|first3 = György|last3 = Kalaus|first4 = Csaba|last4 = Szántay|pmid = 22609781|pmc = 6268133}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are formed from the coupling of [[catharanthine]] and [[vindoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = ''Catharanthus roseus'' L.

==Biological role==
The role of alkaloids for living organisms that produce them is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially assumed that the alkaloids are the final products of [[nitrogen]]  [[metabolism]]  in plants, as [[urea]] in mammals. It was later shown that alkaloid concentration varies over time, and this hypothesis was refuted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers&quot;/&gt; A number of [[ant]]s are suggested to also produce alkaloids as [[venom]] components, however the exact biosynthesis pathways have not been empirically demonstrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pianaro|first=Adriana|last2=Fox|first2=Eduardo G. P.|last3=Bueno|first3=Odair C.|last4=Marsaioli|first4=Anita J.|date=2012-05-15|title=Rapid configuration analysis of the solenopsins|url= |journal=Tetrahedron: Asymmetry|volume=23|issue=9|pages=635–642|doi=10.1016/j.tetasy.2012.05.005|issn=0957-4166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the known functions of alkaloids are related to protection. For example, [[aporphine]] alkaloid [[liriodenine]] produced by the [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]] protects it from parasitic mushrooms. In addition, the presence of alkaloids in the plant prevents insects and [[chordate]] animals from eating it. However, some animals are adapted to alkaloids and even use them in their own metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 283–291&lt;/ref&gt; Such alkaloid-related substances as [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]] and [[histamine]] are important [[neurotransmitter]]s in animals. Alkaloids are also known to regulate plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; One example of an organism that uses alkaloids for protection is the ''[[Utetheisa ornatrix]]'', more commonly known as the ornate moth. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids render these larvae and adult moths unpalatable to many of their natural enemies like coccinelid beetles, green lacewings, insectivorous hemiptera and insectivorous bats.&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Conner (2009). ''Tiger Moths and Woolly Bears—behaviour, ecology, and evolution of the Arctiidae''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 1–10. {{ISBN|0195327373}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of alkaloids being utilized occurs in the [[Agonopterix alstroemeriana|poison hemlock moth]] (''Agonopterix alstroemeriana).'' This moth feeds on its highly toxic and alkaloid-rich host plant [[Conium maculatum|poison hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum'') during its larval stage. ''A. asltroemeriana'' may benefit twofold from the toxicity of the naturally-occurring alkaloids, both through the unpalatability of the species to predators and through the ability of ''A. alstroemeriana'' to recognize ''[[Conium maculatum]]'' as the correct location for oviposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castells|first=Eva|last2=Berenbaum|first2=May R.|date=June 2006|title=Laboratory Rearing of Agonopterix alstroemeriana, the Defoliating Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum L.)

== Applications ==

===In medicine===
Medical use of alkaloid-containing plants has a long history, and, thus, when the first alkaloids were isolated in the 19th century, they immediately found application in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Many alkaloids are still used in medicine, usually in the form of salts widely used including the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 303–309&lt;/ref&gt;

Many synthetic and semisynthetic drugs are structural modifications of the alkaloids, which were designed to enhance or change the primary effect of the drug and reduce unwanted side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[naloxone]], an [[opioid receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]], is a derivative of [[thebaine]] that is present in [[opium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== In agriculture ===
Prior to the development of a wide range of relatively low-toxic synthetic [[pesticide]]s, some alkaloids, such as salts of nicotine and [[anabasine]], were used as [[insecticide]]s. Their use was limited by their high toxicity to humans.&lt;ref&gt;György Matolcsy, Miklós Nádasy, Viktor Andriska [https://books.google.com/books?id=fPiRSsUOpLEC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Pesticide chemistry''], Elsevier, 2002, pp. 21–22 {{ISBN|0-444-98903-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use as psychoactive drugs ===
Preparations of plants containing alkaloids and their extracts, and later pure alkaloids, have long been used as [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]]. [[Cocaine]], [[caffeine]], and [[cathinone]] are [[stimulant]]s of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Veselovskaya|Veselovskaya]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mescaline]] and many indole alkaloids (such as [[psilocybin]], [[dimethyltryptamine]] and [[ibogaine]]) have [[hallucinogen]]ic effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Veselovskaya|Veselovskaya]], p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibogaine: Proceedings from the First International Conference (The Alkaloids Book 56)|isbn=978-0-12-469556-6|at=p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morphine]] and [[codeine]] are strong narcotic pain killers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Veselovskaya|Veselovskaya]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There are alkaloids that do not have strong psychoactive effect themselves, but are [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]]s for semi-synthetic psychoactive drugs. For example, [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] are used to produce [[methcathinone]] and [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Veselovskaya|Veselovskaya]], pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thebaine]] is used in the synthesis of many painkillers such as [[oxycodone]].
