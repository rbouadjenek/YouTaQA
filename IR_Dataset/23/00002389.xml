      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Auger Process.svg|thumb|340px|Two views of the Auger process. (a) illustrates sequentially the steps involved in Auger deexcitation. An incident electron (or photon) creates a core hole in the 1s level. An electron from the 2s level fills in the 1s hole and the transition energy is imparted to a 2p electron which is emitted. The final atomic state thus has two holes, one in the 2s orbital and the other in the 2p orbital. (b) illustrates the same process using [[X-ray notation]], KL&lt;sub alt=&quot;KL_1L_{2,3}&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The '''Auger effect''' is a physical phenomenon in which the filling of an [[Inner-shell electrons|inner-shell]] vacancy of an [[atom]] is accompanied by the emission of an [[electron]] from the same atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger effect|file=A00520}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[core electron]] is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of [[energy]]. Although most often this energy is released in the form of an emitted [[photon]], the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom; this second ejected electron is called an '''Auger electron'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger electron|file=A00521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was first discovered by [[Lise Meitner]] in 1922; [[Pierre Victor Auger]] independently discovered the effect shortly after and is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.&lt;ref name=&quot;grant2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first= John T.|year=2003 |title=Surface Analysis by Auger and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy |location=Chichester |publisher=IM Publications |isbn=1-901019-04-7 |author2=David Briggs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon ejection, the [[kinetic energy]] of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial [[electronic transition]] into the vacancy and the [[ionization energy]] for the [[electron shell]] from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located.

[[Auger electron spectroscopy]] involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either [[X-ray]]s or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons that result as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment.

[[Carrier generation and recombination#Auger recombination|Auger recombination]] is a similar Auger effect which occurs in [[semiconductor]]s. An electron and [[electron hole]] (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the [[conduction band]], increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as [[impact ionization]].

The Auger effect can impact biological molecules such as DNA. Following the K-shell ionization of the component atoms of DNA, Auger electrons are ejected leading to damage of its sugar-phosphate backbone.&lt;ref&gt;Akinari Yokoya &amp; Takashi Ito (2017) Photon-induced Auger effect in biological systems: a review,International Journal of Radiation Biology, 93:8, 743–756, DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2017.1312670&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The Auger emission process was observed and published in 1922 by [[Lise Meitner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01326962|author=L. Meitner|title=Über die Entstehung der β-Strahl-Spektren radioaktiver Substanzen|journal=Z. Phys. |volume=9|issue=1|year=1922|pages=131–144|bibcode= 1922ZPhy....9..131M}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Austrian-Swedish physicist, as a side effect in her competitive search for the nuclear beta electrons with the British physicist [[Charles Drummond Ellis]].

The French physicist [[Pierre Victor Auger]] independently discovered it in 1923&lt;ref&gt;P. Auger: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3130n.image.f187.langFR Sur les rayons β secondaires produits dans un gaz par des rayons X], C.R.A.S. 177 (1923) 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt; upon analysis of a Wilson [[cloud chamber]] experiment and it became the central part of his PhD work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3139/146.110163|title=Pierre Auger – Lise Meitner: Comparative contributions to the Auger effect|year=2009|last1=Duparc|first1=Olivier Hardouin|journal=International Journal of Materials Research |volume=100|issue=09|pages=1162}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-energy X-rays were applied to ionize gas particles and observe [[photoelectric]] electrons. The observation of electron tracks that were independent of the frequency of the incident photon suggested a mechanism for electron ionization that was caused from an [[internal conversion]] of energy from a radiationless transition. Further investigation, and theoretical work using elementary quantum mechanics and transition rate/transition probability calculations, showed that the effect was a radiationless effect more than an internal conversion effect.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Auger Effect and Other Radiationless Transitions&quot;.
