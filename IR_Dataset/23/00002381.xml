'''Andreas Aagesen''' (5 August 1826&amp;nbsp;– 26 October 1879) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] jurist.

==Biography==
Aagesen was educated for the law at [[Christianshavn]] and [[Copenhagen]], and interrupted his studies in 1848 to take part in the [[First Schleswig War]], in which he served as the leader of a reserve battalion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=2}}

In 1855 Aagesen became a professor of [[jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the commission  for drawing up a maritime and commercial code, and the navigation  law of 1882 is mainly his work. In 1879 he was elected a member of the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] (one of two chambers of the Danish Parliament, the [[Rigsdagen]]); but it is as a teacher at the university that he won his reputation. Aagesen was [[Carl Christian Hall]]'s successor as lecturer on [[Roman law]] at the university, and in this department his research was epoch-making.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=2}}
