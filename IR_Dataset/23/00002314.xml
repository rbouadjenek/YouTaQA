'''Professor Anita Faye Hill''' (born July 30, 1956) is an American lawyer and academic. She is a university professor of social policy, law, and women's studies at [[Brandeis University]] and a faculty member of the university's [[Heller School for Social Policy and Management]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty profile&quot; /&gt; She became a national figure in 1991 when she accused U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]], her supervisor at the [[United States Department of Education]] and the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==
Anita Hill was born to a family of farmers in [[Lone Tree, Oklahoma]], the youngest of Albert and Erma Hill's 13 children.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;hearings&quot; /&gt; Her family came from [[Arkansas]], where her maternal grandfather, Henry Eliot, and all of her great-grandparents had been born into slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;creating a stir&quot; /&gt; Hill was raised in the [[Baptists|Baptist]] faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;

After graduating from [[Morris High School (Oklahoma)|Morris High School]], [[Oklahoma]], she enrolled at [[Oklahoma State University]] and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[psychology]] with honors in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hearings&quot; /&gt; She went on to [[Yale Law School]], obtaining her [[Juris Doctor]] degree with honors in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;defends integrity&quot; /&gt;

She was admitted to the District of Columbia [[Bar association|Bar]] in 1980 and began her law career as an associate with the [[Washington, D.C.]] firm of Wald, Harkrader &amp; Ross. In 1981, she became an attorney-adviser to [[Clarence Thomas]], who was then the Assistant Secretary of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Education's [[Office for Civil Rights]]. When Thomas became chairman of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) in 1982, Hill went along to serve as his assistant, leaving the job in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anita-Hill|title=Anita Hill|last=|first=|date=October 2, 2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill then became an assistant professor at the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] [[O.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Coburn School of Law]] at [[Oral Roberts University]] where she taught from 1983 to 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmht&quot; /&gt; In 1986, she joined the faculty at the [[University of Oklahoma College of Law]] where she taught commercial law and contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeks quiet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plans to leave&quot; /&gt;

== Allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas ==
{{further|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination}}

In 1991, President [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]] nominated [[Clarence Thomas]], a federal [[United States courts of appeals|Circuit Judge]], to succeed retiring Associate Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Senate hearings on his [[Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|confirmation]] were initially completed&lt;ref name=&quot;empowered women&quot; /&gt; with Thomas's good character being presented as a primary qualification for the high court because he had only been a judge for slightly more than one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;the nine&quot; /&gt; There had been little organized opposition to Thomas' nomination, and his confirmation seemed assured&lt;ref name=&quot;the nine&quot; /&gt; until a report of a private interview of Hill by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was leaked to the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;empowered women&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt; The hearings were then reopened, and Hill was called to publicly testify.&lt;ref name=&quot;empowered women&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt; Hill said on 11 October 1991 in televised hearings that Thomas had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her while he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|EEOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/us/politics/anita-hill-testimony-clarence-thomas.html|title=Anita Hill's Testimony and Other Key Moments From the Clarence Thomas Hearings|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned on why she followed Thomas to the second job after he had already allegedly harassed her, she said working in a reputable position within the civil rights field had been her ambition. The position was appealing enough to inhibit her from going back into private practice with her previous firm. She said that she only realized later in her life that this ambitious venture was a poor judgment and also explained that &quot;at that time, it appeared that the sexual overtures&amp;nbsp;... had ended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hearings&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/anitahillsenatejudiciarystatement.htm|title=Anita Hill - Opening Statement|date=October 11, 1991|website=American Rhetoric|format=PDF|access-date=April 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304163805/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/PDFFiles/Anita%20Hill%20-%20Opening%20Statement.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hill, Thomas asked her out socially many times during her two years of employment as his assistant,&lt;ref name=&quot;defends integrity&quot; /&gt; and, after she declined his requests, he used work situations to discuss sexual subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearings&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;defends integrity&quot; /&gt; &quot;He spoke about&amp;nbsp;... such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes,&quot; she said, adding that on several occasions Thomas graphically described &quot;his own sexual prowess&quot; and the details of his anatomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearings&quot; /&gt; Hill also recounted an instance in which Thomas examined a can of Coke on his desk and asked, &quot;Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hearings&quot; /&gt; During the hearing, Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] implied that &quot;Hill was working in tandem with 'slick lawyers' and interest groups bent on destroying Thomas' chances to join the court.&quot; Thomas said he had considered Hill a friend whom he had helped at every turn, so when accusations of harassment came from her they were particularly hurtful and he said, &quot;I lost the belief that if I did my best, all would work out.&quot;

Four female witnesses reportedly waited in the wings to support Hill's credibility, but they were not called,&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;strange justice&quot; /&gt; due to what the ''[[Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles Times]]'' described as a private, compromise deal between Republicans and the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] Chair, Democrat [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;private deal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-17/news/mn-911_1_angela-wright|title=Senators' Private Deal Kept '2nd Woman' Off TV: Thomas: Democrats feared Republican attacks on Angela Wright's public testimony.

Hill agreed to take a [[polygraph]] test. While senators and other authorities noted that polygraph results cannot be relied upon and are inadmissible in courts, Hill's results did support her statements.&lt;ref name=&quot;polygraph&quot; /&gt; Thomas did not take a polygraph test. He made a vehement and complete denial, saying that he was being subjected to a &quot;high-tech lynching for uppity blacks&quot; by white liberals who were seeking to block a black conservative from taking a seat on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;testimony of thomas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wife seeks&quot; /&gt; After extensive debate, the [[United States Senate]] confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin since the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;strange justice&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smearing&quot; /&gt;

Thomas' supporters questioned Hill's credibility, claiming she was delusional or had been spurned, leading her to seek revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt; They cited the time delay of ten years between the alleged behavior by Thomas and Hill's accusations, and noted that Hill had followed Thomas to a second job and later had personal contacts with Thomas, including giving him a ride to an airport—behavior which they said would be inexplicable if Hill's allegations were true.&lt;ref name=&quot;defends integrity&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seeks quiet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;corroborated&quot; /&gt; Hill countered that she had come forward because she felt an obligation to share information on the character and actions of a person who was being considered for the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt; She testified that after leaving the EEOC, she had had two &quot;inconsequential&quot; phone conversations with Thomas, and had seen him personally on two occasions, once to get a job reference and the second time when he made a public appearance in Oklahoma where she was teaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearings&quot; /&gt;

Doubts about the veracity of Hill's 1991 testimony persisted long after Thomas took his seat on the Court. They were furthered by ''[[American Spectator]]'' writer [[David Brock]] in his 1993 book ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;strange justice&quot; /&gt; though he later recanted the claims he had made, described in his book as &quot;character assassination,&quot; and apologized to Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;author lied&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By 2004, Brock had made a political about-face from conservative to liberal and founded the progressive media watchdog organization [[Media Matters for America]]&lt;/ref&gt; After interviewing a number of women who alleged that Thomas had frequently subjected them to sexually explicit remarks, ''Wall Street Journal'' reporters [[Jane Mayer]] and [[Jill Abramson]] wrote [[iarchive:strangejusticese00maye|Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas]], a book which concluded that Thomas had lied during his confirmation process.&lt;ref name=&quot;smearing&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;the selling&quot; /&gt; [[Richard Lacayo]] in his 1994 review of the book for ''Time'' magazine remarked, however, that &quot;Their book doesn't quite nail that conclusion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;strange justice&quot; /&gt; In 2007, Kevin {{sic|hide=y|Merida}}, a coauthor of another book on Thomas, remarked that what happened between Thomas and Hill was &quot;ultimately unknowable&quot; by others, but that it was clear that &quot;one of them lied, period.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;good morning&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;supreme discomfort&quot; /&gt; Writing in 2007, Neil Lewis of ''The New York Times'' remarked that, &quot;To this day, each side in the epic he-said, she-said dispute has its unmovable believers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;weighs in&quot; /&gt;

In 2007, Thomas published his autobiography, ''My Grandfather's Son'', in which he revisited the controversy, calling Hill his &quot;most traitorous adversary&quot; and saying that pro-choice liberals, who feared that he would vote to overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' if he were seated on the Supreme Court, used the scandal against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;weighs in&quot; /&gt; He described Hill as touchy and apt to overreact, and her work at the EEOC as mediocre.&lt;ref name=&quot;weighs in&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fires back&quot; /&gt; He acknowledged that three other former EEOC employees had backed Hill's story, but said they had all left the agency on bad terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;fires back&quot; /&gt; He also wrote that Hill &quot;was a left-winger who'd never expressed any religious sentiments whatsoever&amp;nbsp;... and the only reason why she'd held a job in the Reagan administration was because I'd given it to her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grandfather's son&quot; /&gt; Hill denied the accusations in an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' saying she would not &quot;stand by silently and allow [Justice Thomas], in his anger, to reinvent me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;haven't really&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smear&quot; /&gt;

In October 2010, Thomas's wife [[Virginia Thomas|Virginia]], a conservative activist, left a voicemail at Hill's office asking that Hill apologize for her 1991 testimony. Hill initially believed the call was a hoax and referred the matter to the [[Brandeis University]] campus police who alerted the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wife seeks&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; After being informed that the call was indeed from Virginia Thomas, Hill told the media that she did not believe the message was meant to be conciliatory and said, &quot;I testified truthfully about my experience and I stand by that testimony.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wife seeks&quot; /&gt; Virginia Thomas responded that the call had been intended as an &quot;[[Olive branch#Modern usage|olive branch]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wife seeks&quot; /&gt;

===Effects===
Shortly after the Thomas confirmation hearings, President George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush dropped his opposition to a bill that gave harassment victims the right to seek federal damage awards, back pay, and reinstatement, and the law was passed by Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;sexual harassment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot; /&gt; One year later, harassment complaints filed with the EEOC were up 50 percent and public opinion had shifted in Hill's favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot; /&gt; Private companies also started training programs to deter sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=&quot;sexual harassment&quot; /&gt; When journalist [[Cinny Kennard]] asked Hill in 1991 if she would testify against Thomas all over again, Hill answered, &quot;I'm not sure if I could have lived with myself if I had answered those questions any differently.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennard|first1=Cinny|title=Twenty Years Later: Covering the Anita Hill Story|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cinny-kennard/anita-hill-_b_1009527.html|work=HuffPost|access-date=February 6, 2015|quote=In Norman that Oct. 15 night, I asked Hill if she would do it all over again. 'I'm not sure if I could have lived with myself if I had answered those questions any differently,' she replied.|date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manner in which the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] challenged and dismissed Hill's accusations of sexual harassment angered female politicians and lawyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;panel's handling&quot; /&gt; According to D.C.&amp;nbsp;Congressional Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], Hill's treatment by the panel was a contributing factor to the large number of women elected to Congress in 1992. &quot;Women clearly went to the polls with the notion in mind that you had to have more women in Congress,&quot; she said.&lt;ref name=&quot;haven't really&quot; /&gt; In their anthology, ''All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave'', editors [[Gloria T. Hull]], [[Patricia Bell-Scott]], and [[Barbara Smith]] described black feminists mobilizing &quot;a remarkable national response to the Anita Hill–Clarence Thomas controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;all the women&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, a feminist group began a nationwide fundraising campaign and then obtained matching state funds to endow a professorship at the [[University of Oklahoma College of Law]] in honor of Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;plans to leave&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fund&quot; /&gt; Conservative Oklahoma state legislators reacted by demanding Hill's resignation from the university, then introducing a bill to prohibit the university from accepting donations from out-of-state residents, and finally attempting to pass legislation to close down the law school.&lt;ref name=&quot;plans to leave&quot; /&gt; Elmer Zinn Million, a local activist, compared Hill to [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President Kennedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;plans to leave&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fund&quot; /&gt; Certain officials at the university attempted to revoke Hill's tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;the stories&quot; /&gt; After five years of pressure, Hill resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;plans to leave&quot; /&gt; The University of Oklahoma Law School defunded the Anita F. Hill professorship in May 1999, without the position having ever been filled.&lt;ref name=&quot;scraps&quot;/&gt;

On 25 April 2019, the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 US presidential campaign]] team for [[Joe Biden]] disclosed that he had called Ms. Hill to express &quot;his regret for what she endured&quot; 28 years ago, when, as the chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], he presided over the confirmation hearings in which she accused [[Clarence Thomas]], [[George W. Bush|President George Bush]]'s nominee to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], of sexual harassment. Ms. Hill said the call from Mr. Biden left her feeling deeply unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html|title=Joe Biden Expresses Regret to Anita Hill, but She Says 'I'm Sorry' Is Not Enough|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|date=2019-04-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-26|last2=Hulse|first2=Carl|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/biden-hill-spoke-cnntv/index.html|title=Joe Biden and Anita Hill finally spoke.

==Later career==
[[File:2014 Anita Hill.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.8|Hill in 2014 speaking at Harvard Law School]]

Hill continued to teach at the University of Oklahoma, though she spent two years as a visiting professor in California.  She resigned her post in October 1996 and finished her final semester of teaching there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/us/anita-hill-plans-to-leave-teaching-post-in-oklahoma.html|title=Anita Hill Plans to Leave Teaching Post in Oklahoma|last=Thomas|first=Jo|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 13, 1996|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her final semester, she taught a law school seminar on civil rights.  An endowed chair was created in her name, but was later defunded without ever having been filled.&lt;ref name=&quot;scraps&quot;/&gt;

Hill accepted a position as a visiting scholar at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in January 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;uc berkeley&quot; /&gt; but soon joined the faculty of [[Brandeis University]]—first at the Women's Studies Program, later moving to the [[Heller School for Social Policy and Management]]. In 2011, she also took a counsel position with the Civil Rights &amp; Employment Practice group of the plaintiffs' law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers &amp; Toll.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmht&quot; /&gt;

Over the years, Hill has provided commentary on gender and race issues on national television programs, including ''[[60&amp;nbsp;Minutes]]'', ''[[Face the Nation]]'', and ''[[Meet the Press]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cmht&quot; /&gt; She has been a speaker on the topic of commercial law as well as race and women's rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmht&quot; /&gt; She is also the author of articles that have been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cmht&quot; /&gt; and has contributed to many scholarly and legal publications in the areas of [[international commercial law]], [[bankruptcy]], and [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cmht&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;american speakers&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, Hill co-edited ''Race, Gender and Power in America: The Legacy of the Hill-Thomas Hearings'' with Emma Coleman Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;race, gender&quot; /&gt; In 1997 Hill published her autobiography, ''Speaking Truth to Power'',&lt;ref name=&quot;speaking truth&quot; /&gt; in which she chronicled her role in the Clarence Thomas confirmation controversy&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;creating a stir&quot; /&gt; and wrote that creating a better society had been a motivating force in her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;then &amp; now&quot; /&gt; She contributed the piece &quot;The Nature of the Beast: Sexual Harassment&quot; to the 2003 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-dpu/Record/dpu_536804/TOC |title=Library Resource Finder: Table of Contents for: Sisterhood is forever : the women's anth |publisher=Vufind.carli.illinois.edu |access-date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hill published her second book, ''Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home'', which focuses on the sub-prime lending crisis that resulted in the foreclosure of many homes owned by African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;defends&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reimagining&quot; /&gt; She calls for a new understanding about the importance of a home and its place in the [[American Dream]].&lt;ref name=&quot;creating a stir&quot; /&gt; On March 26, 2015, the Brandeis Board of Trustees unanimously voted to recognize Hill with a promotion to Private University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women's Studies.&lt;ref&gt;BrandeisNow, [http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2015/april/hill-appointed-university-professor.html &quot;Anita Hill named University Professor&quot; April 15, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2017, the Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace was formed, selecting Hill to lead its charge against sexual harassment in the entertainment industry. The new initiative was spearheaded by co-chair of the Nike Foundation [[Maria Eitel]], venture capitalist [[Freada Kapor Klein]], [[Lucasfilm]] President [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and talent attorney [[Nina Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/16/anita-hill-chosen-to-lead-hollywood-sexual-harassment-commission/ &quot;Anita Hill chosen to lead Hollywood sexual harassment commission&quot; by Ellen McCarthy] December 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1991, the television sitcom ''[[Designing Women]]'' built its episode &quot;[[Designing Women (season 6)|The Strange Case of Clarence and Anita]]&quot; around the hearings on the Clarence Thomas nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Internet Movie Database|first=|title=The Strange Case of Clarence and Anita|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0558677/|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in the episode &quot;[[Designing Women (season 7)|The Odyssey]]&quot;, the characters imagined what would happen if new president [[Bill Clinton]] nominated Anita Hill to the Supreme Court to sit next to Clarence Thomas.
*Hill is mentioned in the 1992 [[Sonic Youth]] song &quot;[[Youth Against Fascism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/19/arts/recordings-view-sonic-youth-admits-an-outside-world-only-to-confront-it.html|title=RECORDINGS VIEW; Sonic Youth Admits An Outside World, Only to Confront It|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=July 19, 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 1998, Anita Hill published the book ''Speaking Truth to Power''. Throughout much of the book she gives details on her side of the sexual harassment controversy, and her professional relationship with [[Clarence Thomas]]. Aside from that, she also provides a glimpse of what her personal life was like all the way from her childhood days growing up in [[Oklahoma]] to her position as a law professor.&lt;ref name=&quot;speaking truth&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2011, Hill's second book, ''Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home|last=Hill|first=Anita|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2011|isbn=9780807014370|location=Boston, Mass.|url=https://archive.org/details/reimaginingequal00hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discusses the relationship between the home and the American Dream. She also exposes the inequalities within gender and race and home ownership. She argues that inclusive democracy is more important than debates about legal rights. She uses her own history and history of other African American women such as Nannie Helen Burroughs, in order to strengthen her argument for reimagining equality altogether.

In 1994, she wrote a tribute to Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court Justice who preceded Clarence Thomas, titled ''A Tribute to Thurgood Marshall: A Man Who Broke with Tradition on Issues of Race and Gender''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Anita F.|year=1994|title=A tribute to Thurgood Marshall: a man who broke with tradition on issues of race and gender.(Symposium: The Life and Jurisprudence of Justice Thurgood Marshall)|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?public=false&amp;handle=hein.journals/oklrv47&amp;page=127&amp;collection=journals|journal=Oklahoma Law Review|via=heinonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes Thurgood's contributions to the principles of equality as a judge and how his work has affected the lives of African Americans, specifically African American women.

Anita Hill became a proponent for women's rights and feminism. This can be seen through the chapter she wrote in the book ''Women and leadership: the state of play and strategies for change''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Anita|year=2007|title=What Difference Will Women Judges Make? Looking Once More at the &quot;Woman Question&quot;|journal=Women and Leadership: The State of Play and Strategies for Change|volume=1|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote about women judges and why, in her opinion, they play such a large role in balancing the judicial system. She argues that since women and men have different life experiences, ways of thinking, and histories, both are needed for a balanced court system. She writes that in order for the best law system to be created in the United States, all people need the ability to be represented.

==Awards and recognition==
Hill received the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession's &quot;Women of Achievement&quot; award in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/08/10/aba-salutes-anita-hill/49477acf-aa4d-44de-9997-143a0fcc530f/|title=ABA SALUTES ANITA HILL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Hill was selected as a [[Fletcher Foundation]] Fellow. In 2008 she was awarded the Louis P. and Evelyn Smith First Amendment Award&lt;ref name=&quot;fordhall&quot; /&gt; by the [[Ford Hall Forum]].
