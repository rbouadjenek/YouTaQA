'''Albion''' is a city in [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun County]] in the south central region of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. The population was 8,616&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26:2600980 |title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: Albion, MI |publisher=2010.census.gov |access-date=2012-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614174132/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26%3A2600980 |archivedate=2012-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] and is part of the [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]] [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The earliest English-speaking settlers also referred to this area as ''The Forks'', because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the [[Kalamazoo River]]. The ''Festival of the Forks'' has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage.

Since the 19th century, several major manufacturers gave Albion the reputation of a factory town. This has changed with the closure of several manufacturers. In the 21st century, Albion's culture is changing to that of a college town whose residents have a strong interest in technology and sustainability issues.  [[Albion College]] is a private liberal arts college with a student population of about 1,250. Albion is a [[sister city]] with [[Noisy-le-Roi]], France.

==History==
The first European-American settler, Tenney Peabody, arrived in 1833 along with his brother-in-law Charles Blanchard, and another young man named Clark Dowling. Peabody's family followed soon after. In 1835, the Albion Company, a land development company formed by [[Jesse Crowell]], [[plat]]ted a village. Peabody's wife was asked to name the settlement. She considered the name &quot;Peabodyville&quot;, but &quot;Albion&quot; was selected instead, after the former residence of Jesse Crowell. Crowell was appointed in 1838 as the first US postmaster here. . Albion incorporated as a village in 1855 and as a city in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/000910.shtml#TOP &quot;Festival of the Forks&quot;], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 10, 2000, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/960909.shtml &quot;The Passing Scene&quot;], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 9, 2001, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist]] settlers established [[Albion College]], which was known by a few other names before 1861. It was then fully authorized to confer four-year degrees on both men and women. The first classes were held in Albion in 1843.

The forks of the Kalamazoo River provided power for [[Watermill|mills]], and Albion quickly became a mill town as well as an agricultural market. A railroad line arrived in 1852, fostering the development of other industries.

In 1973 Albion was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] by the [[National Civic League]]. It celebrated winning the award on May 15, 1974, when the Governor of Michigan, [[William Milliken]], and many dignitaries came to town. In 1975 the closure of a major factory began a difficult period of industrial restructuring and decline in jobs and population. 

Since that time citizens have mobilized, founding the Albion Community Foundation in 1968, and the Albion Volunteer Service Organization in the 1980s, with support from Albion College, to address the challenge of diminishing economic opportunity.

== Law and government ==
Albion has a [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]] form of government. City residents elect a Mayor [[at-large]] and City Council members from each of six [[single-member district]]s. The council in turn selects a City Manager to handle day-to-day affairs of the city. The mayor presides over and is a voting member of the council. Council members are elected to four-year terms, staggered every two years. A mayor is elected every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofalbionmi.gov/government/mayor_and_city_council/mayor.php|title=Mayor|last=|first=|date=May 25, 2019|website=City of Albion|access-date=May 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan State University, city of East Lansing at odds over proposed income tax|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/michigan_state_university_city.html#incart_river_home|accessdate=August 16, 2017|work=MLive Lansing|publisher=Mlive Media Group|date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
