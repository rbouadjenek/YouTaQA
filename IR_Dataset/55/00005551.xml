It has a population of around 5 million{{UN Population|ref}} in a land area of 51,060 square kilometers (19,714 square miles). An estimated 333,980 people live in the capital and largest city, [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], with around 2 million people in the surrounding metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldscapitalcities.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital-facts-for-san-jose-costa-rica/|title=Capital Facts for San José, Costa Rica|date=18 October 2017|publisher=}}{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica was sparsely inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica|indigenous peoples]] before coming under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] in the 16th century. It remained a peripheral colony of the empire until independence as part of the [[First Mexican Empire]], followed by membership in the [[United Provinces of Central America]], from which it formally declared independence in 1847. Following the brief [[Costa Rican Civil War]] in 1948, it permanently [[Military of Costa Rica|abolished its army]] in 1949, becoming one of only a few sovereign [[List of countries without armed forces|nations without a standing army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespiritudel48.org/docu/h013.htm|author=El Espíritu del 48|title=Abolición del Ejército|accessdate=9 March 2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=9 June 2009 |url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CR/defense.html |title=Costa Rica |publisher=World Desk Reference |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211185659/http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CR/defense.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=9 June 2009|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=39&amp;regionSelect=4-Central_Americas|title=Costa Rica|publisher=Uppsala University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Costa Rica}}
[[File:Stone sphere.jpg|thumb|A stone sphere created by the [[Diquis]] culture at the [[Museo Nacional de Costa Rica|National Museum of Costa Rica]]. [[Stone spheres of Costa Rica|The sphere]] is the icon of the country's cultural identity.]]

=== Pre-Columbian period ===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica}}
Historians have classified the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of Costa Rica as belonging to the [[Intermediate Area]], where the peripheries of the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean]] native cultures overlapped. More recently, [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Costa Rica has also been described as part of the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].

Stone tools, the oldest evidence of human occupation in Costa Rica, are associated with the arrival of various groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s about 10,000 to 7,000 years [[Before Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Turrialba|Turrialba Valley]]. The presence of [[Clovis culture]] type spearheads and arrows from [[South America]] opens the possibility that, in this area, two different cultures coexisted.&lt;ref name=precolumbian1&gt;{{harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| pp=30–31|sp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture became evident in the populations that lived in Costa Rica about 5,000 years ago. They mainly grew [[tubers]] and roots. For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities. These were small and scattered, although the timing of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown.&lt;ref name=precolumbian2&gt;{{harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| p=32|sp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of [[pottery]] appears around 2,000 to 3,000 BCE. Shards of pots, cylindrical vases, platters, gourds and other forms of vases decorated with grooves, prints, and some modelled after animals have been found.&lt;ref name=precolumban3&gt;{{harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| pp=32–33|sp=sí}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of indigenous peoples on modern Costa Rican culture has been relatively small compared to other nations, since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the native population was absorbed into the Spanish-speaking [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial society]] through inter-marriage, except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the [[Bribri people|Bribri]] and [[Boruca people|Boruca]] tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], in the southeastern part of Costa Rica, near the frontier with [[Panama]].

=== Spanish colonization ===
The name {{lang|es|la costa rica}}, meaning &quot;rich coast&quot; in the Spanish language, was in some accounts first applied by [[Christopher Columbus]], who sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his final voyage in 1502,&lt;ref name=&quot;embassy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=About Costa Rica | work=Embassy of Costa Rica in Washington DC | url=http://www.costarica-embassy.org/index.php?q=node/19 | accessdate=18 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported vast quantities of gold jewelry worn by natives.&lt;ref name=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=History of Costa Rica | work=Lonely Planet | url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/costa-rica/history | accessdate=18 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also have come from conquistador [[Gil González Dávila]], who landed on the west coast in 1522, encountered natives, and obtained some of their gold, sometimes by violent theft and sometimes as gifts from local leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rojas, Eugenia Ibarra | title=Fronteras etnicas en la conquista de Nicaragua y Nicoya: entre la solidaridad y el conflicto 800 d.C.-1544. | url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fronteras_etnicas_en_la_conquista_de_Nic/IAcx6DtZba4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=gil+gonzalez+davila+costa+rica&amp;pg=PA89&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher=Universidad de Costa Rica. | year=2001 | isbn=9789977676852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], nominally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. In practice, the captaincy general was a largely autonomous entity within the [[Spanish Empire]]. Costa Rica's distance from the capital of the captaincy in [[Guatemala]], its legal prohibition under Spanish law from trade with its southern neighbor Panama, then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e. [[Colombia]]), and lack of resources such as gold and silver, made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely-inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Claudia Quirós. La Era de la Encomienda. Historia de Costa Rica. Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica. 1990.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica was described as &quot;the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America&quot; by a Spanish governor in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shafer, D. Michael |title=Winners and losers: how sectors shape the developmental prospects of states |url=https://archive.org/details/winnerslosershow00shaf |url-access=registration |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |year=1994|isbn=978-0-8014-8188-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for {{lang|es|[[encomienda]]}} (forced labor), which meant most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large {{lang|es|[[hacienda]]s}} (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was, by and large, unappreciated and overlooked by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] and left to develop on its own. The circumstances during this period are believed to have led to many of the idiosyncrasies for which Costa Rica has become known, while concomitantly setting the stage for Costa Rica's development as a more egalitarian society than the rest of its neighbors. Costa Rica became a &quot;rural democracy&quot; with no oppressed [[mestizo]] or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costarica.com/Destinations/Cities-and-Towns/Cartago/ |title=Costa Rica – Cartago |publisher=Costarica.com |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independence ===
{{See also|Free State of Costa Rica|First Costa Rican Republic}}
Like the rest of [[Central America]], Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On 15 September 1821, after the final Spanish defeat in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mep.go.cr/calendario/aniversario-independencia-nacional |title=Aniversario de la Independencia Nacional |website=Ministerio de Educación Pública |language=es |access-date=13 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though, technically, under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] that had been readopted in 1820, [[Nicaragua]] and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in [[León, Nicaragua|León]].

Upon independence, Costa Rican authorities faced the issue of officially deciding the future of the country. Two bands formed, the Imperialists, defended by [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] and [[Heredia Province|Heredia cities]] which were in favor of joining the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], and the Republicans, represented by the cities of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] and [[Alajuela]] who defended full independence. Because of the lack of agreement on these two possible outcomes, the first civil war of Costa Rica occurred. The [[Battle of Ochomogo]] took place on the Hill of Ochomogo, located in the [[Costa Rican Central Valley|Central Valley]] in 1823. The conflict was won by the Republicans and, as a consequence, the city of [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] lost its status as the capital, which moved to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cartilla Histórica de Costa Rica|publisher = EUNED|year = 2005|isbn = 9789968313759|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Apuntes para la historia de la ciudad de Alajuela|last = Alarmvogel|publisher = Impr.

In 1838, long after the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] ceased to function in practice, Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between [[Guatemala City]] and the Central Plateau, where most of the Costa Rican population lived then and still lives now, meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become economically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/camerica/caeco.html|title=Central America|website=www.cotf.edu|access-date=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802142535/http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/camerica/caeco.html|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic growth in the 19th century ===
{{See also|Liberal State}}
[[Coffee]] was first planted in Costa Rica in 1808,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.co.cr/costa-ricas-coffee-tradition/52303/|title=Costa Rica's Coffee Tradition - Costa Rica Star News|date=21 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1820s, it surpassed [[tobacco]], [[sugar]], and [[cacao bean|cacao]] as a primary [[export]].  Coffee production remained Costa Rica's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century, creating a wealthy class of growers, the so-called Coffee Barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelcostarica.nu/coffee#history|title=Coffee of Costa Rica - el café|website=www.travelcostarica.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue helped to modernize the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embassycrsg.com/history-of-coffee-in-costa-rica.html|title=History of Coffee in Costa Rica|website=Embajada de Costa Rica en Singapur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cafeimports.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafeimports.com/origin_costarica|title=Cafe Imports - Costa Rica|first=Cafe|last=Imports|website=www.cafeimports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] port of [[Puntarenas]] after the main road was built in 1846.&lt;ref name=&quot;cafeimports.com&quot;/&gt; By the mid-1850s the main market for coffee was Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anywhere.com/costa-rica/travel-guide/coffee|title=Costa Rica Coffee - Past &amp; Present Coffee Cultivations|website=www.anywhere.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became a high priority to develop an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government contracted with U.S. businessman [[Minor C. Keith]] to build a railroad from San José to the [[Western Caribbean Zone|Caribbean]] port of [[Limón]]. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9QOAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA310|title=Coffee Production and Processing on a Large Costa Rican Finca|publisher=Bib. Orton IICA / CATIE|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Afro-Costa Ricans descend from [[Jamaica]]n immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway and now make up about 3% of Costa Rica's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Blacks of Costa Rica |url =http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Blacks-of-Costa-Rica.html | work =World Culture Encyclopedia | accessdate = 23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the Costa Rican government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas came to rival coffee as the principal Costa Rican export, while foreign-owned corporations (including the [[United Fruit Company]] later) began to hold a major role in the national economy and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUM8y5L1h8kC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'#v=onepage&amp;q=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'|title=The History of Costa Rica|first=Monica A.|last=Rankin|date=29 December 2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313379444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major labor dispute between the peasants and the United Fruit Company (The Great Banana Strike) was a major event in the country's history and was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective [[trade unions in Costa Rica]], as the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YujmDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=Great+Banana+strike+1934#v=onepage&amp;q=Great+Banana+strike+1934|title=Bananas and Business: The United Fruit Company in Colombia, 1899-2000|first=Marcelo|last=Bucheli|date=1 February 2005|publisher=NYU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780814769874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aflY6uCO1DMC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Great+Banana+strike+1934+collective+agreement#v=onepage&amp;q=Great+Banana+strike+1934+collective+agreement|title=Winners and Losers: How Sectors Shape the Developmental Prospects of States|first=D.

==== 20th century ====
{{See also|Reform State}}
Historically, Costa Rica has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability than many of its fellow Latin American nations. Since the late 19th century, however, Costa Rica has experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917–19, General [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of [[Dictatorship of the Tinoco Brothers|Tinoco's regime]] led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military. In 1948, [[José Figueres Ferrer]] led an [[Costa Rican Civil War|armed uprising]] in the wake of a disputed presidential election between [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia]] (who had been president between 1940 and 1944) and [[Otilio Ulate Blanco]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://reachian.googlepages.com/seniorthesis2 Ian Holzhauer, &quot;The Presidency of Calderón Guardia&quot; (University of Florida History Thesis, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day [[Costa Rican Civil War]] was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century.

The victorious rebels formed a government junta that [[military of Costa Rica|abolished the military]] altogether, and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes-military&quot;/&gt; Having enacted these reforms, the junta transferred power to Ulate on 8 November 1949. After the ''coup d'état'', Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution [[Costa Rican general election, 1953|in 1953]]. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest [[Costa Rican general election, 2018|in 2018]].  With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least 1948, the country is the region's most stable.&lt;ref name=&quot;peace&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pacifism&quot;/&gt;

Costa Rica is an active member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]]. The [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations University of Peace]] are based in Costa Rica. It is also a member of many other international organizations related to [[human rights]] and democracy, such as the [[Community of Democracies]].

On 10 September 1961, some months after [[Fidel Castro]] declared [[Cuba]] a socialist state, Costa Rican President [[Mario Echandi]] ended diplomatic relations with Cuba through ''Executive Decree Number 2''. This freeze lasted 47 years until President [[Óscar Arias|Óscar Arias Sánchez]] re-established normal relations on 18 March 2009, saying, &quot;If we have been able to turn the page with regimes as profoundly different to our reality as occurred with the USSR or, more recently, with the Republic of China, how would we not do it with a country that is geographically and culturally much nearer to Costa Rica?&quot; Arias announced that both countries would exchange ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-03-18/world/costa.rica.cuba.ties_1_costa-rica-president-oscar-arias-cuban-people? &quot;Costa Rica re-establishes ties with Cuba&quot;] {{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''CNN World'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2009, the [[International Court of Justice]] in the Hague upheld Costa Rica's navigation rights for commercial purposes to [[artisanal fishing|subsistence fishing]] on their side of the river. An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal; the court ruled Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua argued, but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled that Costa Rican boats and passengers must stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an identity document or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic. Nicaragua may require Costa Rican boats to display the [[flag of Nicaragua]], but may not charge them for departure clearance from its ports. These were all specific items of contention brought to the court in the 2005 filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/12579933-1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511230540/http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/12579933-1.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |title=World Court Settles San Juan River Dispute; Nicaragua and Costa Rica Both Claim Victory |publisher=Allbusiness.com|date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bevölkerungspyramide Costa Rica 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]
In 2011, there were over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: [[Quitirrisí]] (in the Central Valley), Matambú or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar people|Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (southern Costa Rica) and {{Ill|Térraba people|es|Térraba|lt=Térraba}} (southern Costa Rica).

The population includes [[European Costa Ricans]] (of European ancestry), primarily of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent,&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; with significant numbers of Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are [[Creole English]]-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schulman |first=Bob | title='Little Jamaica' Rocks on the Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/little-jamaica-rocks-on-t_b_8100114 |work=Huffington Post|access-date=22 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Charles W. |title=JAMAICAN BLACKS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS IN COSTA RICA |journal=Social and Economic Studies |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=339–361 |location=Jamaica |publisher=Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies, University of the West Indies |jstor=27861669 |year=1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Niños costarricenses.JPG|thumb|Costa Rican school children]]
The 2011 census classified 83.6% of the population as white or [[Mestizo]]; the latter are persons of combined European and Amerindian descent. The [[Mulatto]] segment (mix of white and black) represented 6.7% and indigenous people made up 2.4% of the population.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Native and European mixed blood populations are far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], where almost half the population is visibly mestizo, a legacy of the more pervasive unions between Spanish colonists and Chorotega Amerindians through several generations, and [[Limón]], where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.

Costa Rica hosts many refugees, mainly from [[Colombia]] and [[Nicaragua]].

[[Christianity]] is Costa Rica's predominant religion, with [[Roman Catholicism]] being the official [[state religion]] according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees [[freedom of religion]]. It is the only state in the [[Americas]] which established Roman Catholicism as its state religion; other such countries are microstates in Europe: [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], the [[Vatican City]] and [[Malta]].

The Latinobarómetro survey of 2017 found that 57% of the population identify themselves as [[Roman Catholics]], 25% are [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestants]], 15% report that they [[Nonreligious|do not have a religion]], and 2% declare that they belong to another religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;latbar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Latinobarómetro 1995 - 2017: El Papa Francisco y la Religión en Chile y América Latina|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/site/artic/20180112/asocfile/20180112124342/f00006494_religion_chile_america_latina_2017.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2018|language=es|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey indicated a decline in the share of Catholics and rise in the share of Protestants and irreligious.&lt;ref name=&quot;latbar&quot;/&gt; A University of Costa Rica survey of 2018 show similar rates; 52% Catholics, 22% Protestants, 17% irreligious and 3% other.&lt;ref name=ciep /&gt; The rate of secularism is high by Latin American standards.

Due to small, but continuous, immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being [[Buddhism]], with about 100,000 practitioners (over 2% of the population).&lt;ref name=&quot;buddhistchannel.tv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=71,11009,0,0,1,0|title=World - Buddhism in Costa Rica|website=www.buddhistchannel.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Buddhists are members of the [[Han Chinese]] community of about 40,000 with some new local converts.

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Costa Rica}}
The primary language spoken in Costa Rica is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which features characteristics [[Costa Rican Spanish|distinct to the country]], a form of Central American Spanish. Costa Rica is a linguistically diverse country and home to at least five living local indigenous languages spoken by the descendants of pre-Columbian peoples: Maléku, Cabécar, Bribri, Guaymí, and Buglere.

Of native languages still spoken, primarily in indigenous reservations, the most numerically important are the [[Bribri language|Bribri]], [[Maléku language|Maléku]], [[Cabécar language|Cabécar]] and [[Ngäbere language]]s; some of these have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica while others have a few hundred. Some languages, such as [[Teribe language|Teribe]] and [[Boruca language|Boruca]], have fewer than a thousand speakers. The Buglere language and the closely related Guaymí are spoken by some in southeast Puntarenas.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldatlas.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-languages-are-spoken-in-costa-rica.html|title=What Languages Are Spoken In Costa Rica?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[English-based creole language|Creole-English]] language, [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican ''patois'']] (also known as [[Limonese Creole|Mekatelyu]]), is an English-based Creole language spoken by the Afro-Carib immigrants who have settled primarily in Limón Province along the Caribbean coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldatlas.com&quot;/&gt;

About 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or German as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/marzo/11/pais1457622.html|title=Solo 1 de cada 10 adultos habla un segundo idioma|publisher=[[La Nación (Costa Rica)]]|author=Jairo Villegas|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
[[File:World's Largest Oxcart Sarchi Costa Rica.JPG|thumb|[[Las Carretas, Costa Rican Oxcarts|Las Carretas (oxcarts)]] are a national symbol.]]
{{Main|Culture of Costa Rica}}
Costa Rica was the point where the [[Mesoamerican]] and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African workers during the 17th and 18th centuries.

As a result of the immigration of Spaniards, their 16th-century Spanish culture and its evolution marked everyday life and culture until today, with Spanish language and the Catholic religion as primary influences.

The Department of Culture, Youth, and Sports is in charge of the promotion and coordination of cultural life. The work of the department is divided into Direction of Culture, Visual Arts, Scenic Arts, Music, Patrimony and the System of Libraries. Permanent programs, such as the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica and the Youth Symphony Orchestra, are conjunctions of two areas of work: Culture and Youth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Dance-oriented genres, such as ''[[Soca music|soca]]'', ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'', ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'', ''[[cumbia]]'' and Costa Rican swing are enjoyed increasingly by older rather than younger people. The guitar is popular, especially as an accompaniment to folk dances; however, the marimba was made the national instrument.

{{Further|Costa Rican cuisine}}
Costa Rican cuisine is a blend of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Spanish, African and many other cuisine origins. Dishes such as the very traditional [[Tamal (dish)|tamale]] and many others made of corn are the most representative of its indigenous inhabitants, and similar to other neighboring Mesoamerican countries. Spaniards brought many new ingredients to the country from other lands, especially spices and domestic animals. And later in the 19th century, the African flavor lent its presence with influence from other Caribbean mixed flavors. This is how Costa Rican cuisine today is very varied, with every new ethnic group who had recently become part of the country's population influencing the country's cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerncostarica.biz/General/cat-others/Costarican-Typical-Food/179/ |title=Costa Rican Typical Food |publisher=Southerncostarica.biz |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2011}}

There are both state and private universities. The [[University of Costa Rica]] has been awarded the title &quot;Meritorious Institution of Costa Rican Education and Culture&quot;.

A 2016 report by the U.S. government report identifies the current challenges facing the education system, including the high dropout rate among high school students. The country needs even more workers who are fluent in English and languages such as Portuguese, Mandarin and French.

But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (''Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social'' – CCSS), Costa Rica has provided [[universal health care]] to its wage-earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (''Programa de Salud Rural'') for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total health expenditure). About 7% of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded.

Primary health care facilities in Costa Rica include health clinics, with a [[general practitioner]], nurse, clerk, pharmacist and a primary health technician&lt;!---, around one per two population--- Clarify?----&gt;. In 2008, there were five specialty national hospitals, three general national hospitals, seven regional hospitals, 13 peripheral hospitals, and 10 major clinics serving as referral centers for primary care clinics, which also deliver biopsychosocial services, family and community medical services and promotion and prevention programs. Patients can choose private health care to avoid waiting lists.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}
