'''[[Ivory Coast]]''' (Côte d'Ivoire) is a [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] nation in southern [[West Africa]] located at 8 00°N, 5 00°W. The country is approximately square in shape. Its southern border is a {{convert|515|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} coastline on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] on the north Atlantic Ocean. On the other three sides it borders five other African nations for a total of {{convert|3458|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}: [[Liberia]] to the southwest for {{convert|778|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Guinea]] to the northwest for {{convert|816|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mali]] to the north-northwest for {{convert|599|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Burkina Faso]] to the north-northeast for {{convert|545|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Ghana]] to the east for {{convert|720|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

Ivory Coast comprises {{convert|322463|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|318003|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|4460|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}} is water, which makes the country about the size of [[Germany]].

== Maritime claims ==
Ivory Coast makes maritime claims of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=on}} as an [[exclusive economic zone]], {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}} of territorial sea, and a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1}} [[continental shelf]].

==Terrain and topography==
Ivory Coast's terrain can generally be described as a large plateau rising gradually from sea level in the south to almost {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} elevation in the north. The nation's natural resources have made it into a comparatively prosperous nation in the [[Economy of Africa|African economy]]. 
The '''southeastern region of Ivory Coast is marked by coastal inland lagoons that starts at the''' Ghanaian border and stretch {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the eastern half of the coast. The southern region, especially the southwest, is covered with dense tropical moist forest. The [[Eastern Guinean forests]] extend from the Sassandra River across the south-central and southeast portion of Ivory Coast and east into [[Ghana]], while the [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] extend west from the [[Sassandra River]] into [[Liberia]] and southeastern [[Guinea]]. The mountains of [[Dix-Huit Montagnes]] region, in the west of the country near the border with Guinea and Liberia, are home to the [[Guinean montane forests]].

The [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west, and is the transition zone between the coastal forests and the interior [[savanna]]s. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Ivory Coast is part of the [[West Sudanian Savanna]] ecoregion of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]]. It is a zone of lateritic or sandy soils, with vegetation decreasing from south to north.

The terrain is mostly flat to undulating plain, with mountains in the northwest. The lowest elevation in Ivory Coast is at sea level on the coasts. The highest elevation is [[Mount Nimba]], at {{convert|1752|m}} in the far west of the country along the border with Guinea and Liberia.

==Rivers==
{{See also|List of rivers of Ivory Coast}}

The Cavalla River drains the western border area of the Ivory Coast and eastern Liberia. It forms the southern two-thirds of the international boundary between Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.

The [[Sassandra River]] forms in the Guinea highlands and drains much of the western part of the Ivory Coast east of the Cavalla River.

The [[Bandama River]] is the longest river in the Ivory Coast with a length of some {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} draining the east central part of the country.  In 1973 the [[Kossou Dam]] was constructed at [[Kossou]] on the Bandama creating [[Lake Kossou]].  The capital, [[Yamoussoukro]], is located near the river south of the lake.

The [[Komoé River]] originates on the [[Sikasso]] Plateau of [[Burkina Faso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author1=Rupley, Lawrence A. |author2=Bangali, Lamissa |author3=Diamitani, Boureima |title=Sikasso Plateau|year=2013|encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HnRbA-pYcegC&amp;pg=PA197 197]|isbn=978-0-8108-6770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and briefly follows the border between Burkina Faso and [[Ivory Coast]] before entering Ivory Coast. It drains the northeastern and eastern-most portions of the country before emptying into the eastern end of the [[Ébrié Lagoon]] and ultimately the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the Atlantic Ocean.  Its waters contribute to the [[Comoé National Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mepham1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mepham|first=Robert|title=IUCN Directory of African Wetlands|publisher=Pinter Pub. Ltd.|year=1991|isbn=2-88032-949-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Ivory Coast is generally warm and humid, ranging from [[equator]]ial in the southern coasts to [[Tropics|tropical]] in the middle and semiarid in the far north. There are three seasons: warm and dry (November to March), hot and dry (March to May), and hot and wet (June to October). Temperatures average between {{convert|25|and|32|°C|°F|1}} and range from {{convert|10|to|40|°C|°F}}.

==Crops and natural resources==
Ivory Coast has a large [[timber]] industry due to its large forest coverage. The nation's [[hardwood]] exports match that of [[Brazil]]. In recent years there has been much concern about the rapid rate of [[deforestation]]. [[Rainforest]]s are being destroyed at a rate sometimes cited as the highest in the world. The only forest left completely untouched in Ivory Coast is [[Taï National Park]] (''Parc National de Taï''), a {{convert|3600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} area in the country's far southwest that is home to over 150 [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species and many other [[endangered species]] such as the [[Pygmy hippopotamus]] and 11 species of [[monkey]]s.

Nine percent of the country is [[arable land]]. Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, a major national [[cash crop]]. Other chief crops include [[coffee]], [[banana]]s, and [[Elaeis guineensis|oil palms]], which produce [[palm oil]] and kernels. [[Natural resource]]s include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[diamond]]s, [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[tantalum]], [[silica]] sand, [[clay]], [[palm oil]], and [[hydropower]].

==Natural hazards==
[[Natural hazard]]s include the heavy surf and the lack of [[natural harbor]]s on the coast; during the rainy season torrential flooding is a danger.

== Extreme points ==

Extreme points are the geographic points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in the country.

* Northernmost point – the point at which the border with [[Mali]] enters the [[Bagoé river]], [[Savanes District]], the [[Sahel]].
* Easternmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ghana]] south-west of the town of [[Tanbi]], [[Zanzan District|Zanzan]]
* Southernmost point – [[Boubré]], [[Bas-Sassandra District|Bas-Sassandra district]]
* Westernmost point -  unnamed location on the border with [[Liberia]] in the [[Nuon river]] west of [[Klobli]], [[Montagnes District|Montagnes district]]
