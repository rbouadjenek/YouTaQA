{{Agriculture|related}}
'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field of [[biology]] that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social science]]s that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy==

The three terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:

* Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
* [[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based crops.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosso 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boucher 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plant breeding and genetics
* Plant pathology
* Horticulture
* Soil science
* Entomology
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Minimizing the effects of pests ([[weed]]s, [[insect]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[nematode]]s) on crop or animal production systems.
* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the US and the EU.
* Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.

===Agricultural biotechnology===
[[Agricultural biotechnology]] is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular marker]]s, [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccine]]s, and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=What is Agricultural Biotechnology? | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=3 February 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020957/http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | archivedate=26 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fertilizer ==
One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment.

==History==
{{Main|History of agricultural science}}

In the 18th century, [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB 1840&quot;&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. ''A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry. To which is Added, a Dissertation on the Kitchen and Garden.'' 1840. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, [[John Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] began a set of long-term field experiments at [[Rothamsted Research Station]] in England; some of them are still running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Long Term Experiments|url=https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|publisher=Rothamsted Research|accessdate=26 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327084207/https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|archivedate=27 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887]], which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002140821/http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf |date=2 October 2008 }}. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}
&lt;!--
Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[Developing country|developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.--&gt;
