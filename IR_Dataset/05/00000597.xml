The '''Austroasiatic languages'''{{refn|group=note|Sometimes also as ''Austro-Asiatic'' or ''Austroasian''}} {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔː|s|t|r|oʊ|.|eɪ|ʒ|i|ˈ|æ|t|ɪ|k}}, also known as '''Mon–Khmer'''&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2012) notes, ''MK in the wider sense including the Munda languages of eastern South Asia is also known as Austroasiatic.''&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|n|ˌ|k|ə|ˈ|m|ɛər}}, are a large [[language family]] of [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], also scattered throughout parts of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], and southern [[China]]. There are around 117 million speakers of Austroasiatic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Austroasiatic.html|title=Austroasiatic|website=www.languagesgulper.com|language=en|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these languages, only [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long-established recorded history and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern [[national language]]s (in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], respectively).  The Mon language is a recognised indigenous language in [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. In Myanmar, the [[Wa language]] is the de facto official language of [[Wa State]]. [[Santali language|Santali]] is one of the 22 [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India|scheduled languages of India]]. The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and [[Khasi–Khmuic languages|Khasi–Khmuic]]),&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and East Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the extant [[autochthonous language]]s of Southeast Asia (excluding the [[Andaman Islands]]), with the neighboring [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Hmong-Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] being the result of later migrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot; /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Austroasiatic'' comes from a combination of the [[Latin]] words for &quot;South&quot; and &quot;Asia&quot;, hence &quot;South Asia&quot;. 

== Typology ==
Regarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic [[sesquisyllable|&quot;sesquisyllabic&quot;]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced [[minor syllable]] followed by a stressed, full syllable.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=524}} This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=526}} As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have [[infix]]es, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.&lt;ref&gt;Alves 2014, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth, Gérard (1989). [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf &quot;Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast.

However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]]. Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.

== Proto-language ==
{{Main|Proto-Austroasiatic language}}

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon–Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.

Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

{| class=&quot;IPA wikitable&quot;
|-
| *p || *t || *c || *k || *ʔ
|-
| *b || *d || *ɟ || *ɡ ||
|-
| *ɓ || *ɗ || *ʄ || ||
|-
| *m || *n || *ɲ || *ŋ ||
|-
| *w || *l, *r || *j || ||
|-
| || *s || || || *h
|}

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*ʄ}}.  {{IPA|*ʄ}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle [[Mekong]], in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot; /&gt;

Peiros (2011) criticized Sidwell's theory heavily and calls it a bunch of contradictions. He show with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near the [[Yangtze]]. He suggests the [[Sichuan Basin]] as likely homeland of proto-Austroasiatic before they migrated to other parts of central and southern China and than into Southeast Asia. He further suggests that the family must be as old as proto-Austronesian and proto-Sinotibetan or even older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jolr.ru/files/(68)jlr2011-6(101-114).pdf|title=Some thoughts on the problem of the Austro-Asiatic homeland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Peiros (2011)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg van Driem (2011) proposes that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere in southern China. He suggests that the region around the [[Pearl River (China)]] is the likely homeland of the Austroasiatic languages and people. He further suggests, based on genetic studies, that the migration of [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] people from Taiwan replaced the original Austroasiatic language but the effect on the people was only minor. Local Austroasiatic speakers adopted Kra-Dai languages and partially their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[George van Driem|van Driem, George]]. (2011). Rice and the Austroasiatic and Hmong-Mien homelands. In N. J. Enfield (Ed.), ''Dynamics of Human Diversity: The Case of Mainland Southeast Asia'' (pp. 361-390). Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguists Sagart (2011) and Bellwood (2013) support the theory of an origin of Austroasiatic along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze river]] in southern China.&lt;ref&gt;Reconstructing Austroasiatic prehistory. In P. Sidwell &amp; M. Jenny (Eds.), ''The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages''. Leiden: Brill. (Page 1: “Sagart (2011) and Bellwood (2013) favour the middle Yangzi”&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic and linguistic research in 2015 about ancient people in East Asia suggest an origin and homeland of Austroasiatic in today [[South China|southern China]] or even further north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283080042|title=Y-chromosome diversity suggests southern origin and Paleolithic backwave migration of Austro- Asiatic speakers from eastern Asia to the Indian subcontinent OPEN|last=Zhang|first=Xiaoming|last2=Liao|first2=Shiyu|last3=Qi|first3=Xuebin|last4=Liu|first4=Jiewei|last5=Kampuansai|first5=Jatupol|last6=Zhang|first6=Hui|last7=Yang|first7=Zhaohui|last8=Serey|first8=Bun|last9=Tuot|first9=Sovannary|date=20 October 2015|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal classification ==
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the [[Mon–Khmer languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Munda languages]] of [[East India|East]] and [[Central India]] and parts of [[Bangladesh]], parts of [[Nepal]]. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austroasiatic are debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accepts traditional &quot;Mon–Khmer&quot; as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in Sumatra (Diffloth), the [[Chamic languages]] of Vietnam, and the [[Land Dayak languages]] of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, ''2009. Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?'' Presentation at ICAAL-4, Bangkok, 29–30 October. Summarized in Sidwell and Blench (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diffloth (1974) ===
[[Gérard Diffloth|Diffloth]]'s widely cited original classification, now abandoned by Diffloth himself, is used in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and—except for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in ''Ethnologue.''

=== Peiros (2004) ===
Peiros is a [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary. This means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to [[language contact]]. Indeed, when Sidwell (2009) replicated Peiros's study with languages known well enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching) structure below.

This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of Y-Chromosomal [[Haplogroup O-M95 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup O2a1-M95]].

=== Sidwell (2009, 2011) ===
[[File:Mekong river basin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.81|[[Paul Sidwell]] and [[Roger Blench]] propose that the Austroasiatic phylum dispersed via the [[Mekong]] River [[drainage basin]].]]
[[Paul Sidwell]] (2009), in a [[lexicostatistical]] comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant [[Munda languages|Munda]] and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.

He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell &amp; [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. &quot;[http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis].&quot; Enfield, NJ (ed.) ''Dynamics of Human Diversity'', 317–345. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

If this would the case, Sidwell &amp; Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell &amp; Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] river valley relatively quickly.

Subsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015a. &quot;Austroasiatic classification.&quot; In Jenny, Mathias and Paul Sidwell, eds (2015). ''The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages''. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that [[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]] subgroups with [[Aslian languages|Aslian]], just as how Khasian and Palaungic subgroup with each other. A subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis of the Austroasiatic language family by Sidwell (2015b)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015b. [https://www.eva.mpg.de/fileadmin/content_files/linguistics/conferences/2015-diversity-linguistics/Sidwell_slides.pdf A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Austroasiatic languages]. Presented at Diversity Linguistics: Retrospect and Prospect, 1–3 May 2015 (Leipzig, Germany), Closing conference of the Department of Linguistics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure, with an east-west division (consisting of Munda, Khasic, Palaungic, and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present.

Integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015c)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015c. ''Phylogeny, innovations, and correlations in the prehistory of Austroasiatic''. Paper presented at the workshop ''Integrating inferences about our past: new findings and current issues in the peopling of the Pacific and South East Asia'', 22 – 23 June 2015, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into [[Indochina]] from the [[Lingnan]] area of [[southern China]], with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China.

Sidwell (2015c) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the [[Neolithic transition]] era of [[mainland Southeast Asia]], with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P. Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] watershed of [[Lingnan]], which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the [[Mekong River]] via [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt; Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and [[millet]], kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt;

At 4,500 B.P., this &quot;Neolithic package&quot; suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt; However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages.

During the [[Iron Age]] about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as [[Vietic languages|Vietic]], [[Katuic languages|Katuic]], [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] were formed, while the more internally diverse [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt; By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt;

Paul Sidwell (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2018. ''Austroasiatic deep chronology and the problem of cultural lexicon''. Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held 17–19 May 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.

[[Roger Blench]] (2017)&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2017&quot;&gt;Blench, Roger. 2017. ''[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Blench.pdf Waterworld: lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in Austroasiatic]''. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern [[Indochina]] (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 B.C.), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2017&quot;/&gt;

Hence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2017&quot;/&gt;

=== Possible extinct branches ===
[[Roger Blench]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2009. &quot;[http://icaal.org/abstract/blench-are.html Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] evidence in modern-day languages.
* '''Pre-[[Chamic language|Chamic]] languages''' (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the Chamic migrations). Chamic has various Austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing Austroasiatic branches (Sidwell 2006, 2007).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2006&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2006. &quot;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf Dating the Separation of Acehnese and Chamic By Etymological Analysis of the Aceh-Chamic Lexicon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108030716/http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf |date=8 November 2014 }}.&quot; In The ''Mon-Khmer Studies Journal'', 36: 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2007&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2007. &quot;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2002mon-khmer.pdf The Mon-Khmer Substrate in Chamic: Chamic, Bahnaric and Katuic Contact].&quot; In SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002, edited by Ratree Wayland et al.. Canberra, Australia, 113-128. Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, The Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; Larish (1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;Larish1999&quot;&gt;Larish, Michael David. 1999. ''The Position of Moken and Moklen Within the Austronesian Language Family''. Doctoral dissertation, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa.&lt;/ref&gt; also notes that [[Moklenic languages]] contain many Austroasiatic loanwords, some of which are similar to the ones found in Chamic.
* '''[[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] substratum''' (Sidwell 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2006&quot; /&gt; Acehnese has many basic words that are of Austroasiatic origin, suggesting that either Austronesian speakers have absorbed earlier Austroasiatic residents in northern Sumatra, or that words might have been borrowed from Austroasiatic languages in southern Vietnam – or perhaps a combination of both. Sidwell (2006) argues that Acehnese and Chamic had often borrowed Austroasiatic words independently of each other, while some Austroasiatic words can be traced back to Proto-Aceh-Chamic. Sidwell (2006) accepts that Acehnese and Chamic are related, but that they had separated from each other before Chamic had borrowed most of its Austroasiatic lexicon.
* '''[[Bornean languages|Bornean]] substrate languages''' (Blench 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2010. &quot;[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/ojs/index.php/BIPPA/article/viewFile/10637/10669 Was there an Austroasiatic Presence in Island Southeast Asia prior to the Austronesian Expansion?]&quot; In ''Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association'', Vol. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Blench cites Austroasiatic-origin words in modern-day Bornean branches such as [[Land Dayak languages|Land Dayak]] ([[Bidayuh languages|Bidayuh]], [[Bakati’ language|Dayak Bakatiq]], etc.), [[Dusunic languages|Dusunic]] ([[Dusun language|Central Dusun]], [[Brunei Bisaya language|Visayan]], etc.), [[Kayan–Murik languages|Kayan]], and [[Kenyah languages|Kenyah]], noting especially resemblances with [[Aslian languages|Aslian]]. As further evidence for his proposal, Blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in Borneo shared in common with Austroasiatic-speaking groups in mainland Southeast Asia. Adelaar (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, K.A. 1995. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.692.6923&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Borneo as a cross-roads for comparative Austronesian linguistics]. In P. Bellwood, J.J. Fox and D. Tryon (eds.), The Austronesians, pp. 81-102. Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; has also noticed phonological and lexical similarities between [[Land Dayak languages|Land Dayak]] and [[Aslian languages|Aslian]].
* '''[[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] substratum''' (&quot;'''''Rongic'''''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2013. [https://www.academia.edu/5562335/Rongic_a_vanished_branch_of_Austroasiatic ''Rongic: a vanished branch of Austroasiatic'']. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; Many words of Austroasiatic origin have been noticed in Lepcha, suggesting a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] superstrate laid over an Austroasiatic substrate. Blench (2013) calls this branch &quot;''Rongic''&quot; based on the Lepcha autonym ''Róng''.

Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:
* '''[[Jiamao language|Jiamao]]''', based on evidence from the register system of Jiamao, a [[Hlai languages|Hlai]] language (Thurgood 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Thurgood, Graham. 1992. &quot;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/thurgood1992aberrancy.pdf The aberrancy of the Jiamao dialect of Hlai: speculation on its origins and history]&quot;. In Ratliff, Martha S. and Schiller, E. (eds.), ''Papers from the First Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society'', 417–433. Arizona State University, Program for Southeast Asian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary in relation to other [[Hlai languages]].
* '''[[Kerinci language|Kerinci]]''': van Reijn (1974)&lt;ref&gt;van Reijn, E. O. (1974). &quot;Some Remarks on the Dialects of North Kerintji: A link with Mon-Khmer Languages.&quot; ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 31, 2: 130–138. {{JSTOR|41492089}}.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Kerinci, a [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] language of central [[Sumatra]], shares many phonological similarities with Austroasiatic languages, such as [[sesquisyllabic]] word structure and vowel inventory.

John Peterson (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, John (2017). &quot;[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Peterson.pdf The prehistorical spread of Austro-Asiatic in South Asia]&quot;. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that &quot;pre-[[Munda languages|Munda]]&quot; languages may have once dominated the eastern [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east. Peterson notes that eastern [[Indo-Aryan languages]] display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of Munda languages, while western Indo-Aryan languages do not.

== Writing systems ==
Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]], [[Thai alphabet|Thai]], [[Lao alphabet|Lao]], and [[Burmese alphabet|Burmese]] alphabets. Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing. This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century. The following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages.

== External relations ==

=== Austric languages ===
{{Main|Austric languages}}
Austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial [[Austric languages|Austric hypothesis]], which also includes the [[Austronesian languages]], and in some proposals also the [[Kra–Dai languages]] and the [[Hmong–Mien languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Lawrence A. |year=2009 |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Keith |editor2-last=Ogilvie |editor2-first=Sarah |title=Concise Encyclopaedia of Languages of the World |publisher=Elsevier |location=Oxford |pages=92–94 |chapter=Austric Hypothesis |ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hmong-Mien ===
Several lexical resemblances are found between the Hmong-Mien and Austroasiatic language families (Ratliff 2010), some of which had earlier been proposed by [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]] (1951). This could imply a relation or early language contact along the [[Yangtze]].&lt;ref&gt;Haudricourt, André-Georges. 1951. [https://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_1951_num_44_2_5185 Introduction à la phonologie historique des langues miao-yao] [An introduction to the historical phonology of the Miao-Yao languages]. ''Bulletin de l’École Française d'Extrême-Orient'' 44(2). 555–576.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cai (et al. 2011), [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] is at least partially related to Austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], especially [[Tibeto-Burman languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Consortium|first=the Genographic|last2=Li|first2=Hui|last3=Jin|first3=Li|last4=Huang|first4=Xingqiu|last5=Li|first5=Shilin|last6=Wang|first6=Chuanchao|last7=Wei|first7=Lanhai|last8=Lu|first8=Yan|last9=Wang|first9=Yi|date=31 August 2011|title=Human Migration through Bottlenecks from Southeast Asia into East Asia during Last Glacial Maximum Revealed by Y Chromosomes|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e24282|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024282|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3164178|pmid=21904623|bibcode=2011PLoSO...624282C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Aryan languages===
It is suggested that the Austroasiatic languages have some influence on Indo-Aryan languages including [[Sanskrit]] and middle Indo-Aryan languages. Indian linguist [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] were borrowed from [[Munda languages|Munda]] languages. Additionally, French linguist [[Jean Przyluski]] suggested a similarity between the tales from the Austroasiatic realm and the Indian mythological stories of [[Satyavati|Matsyagandha]] (from ''[[Mahabharata]]'') and the [[Nāga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dx5dzJGGBg0C&amp;pg=PR15&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=austroasiatic+influence+on+india#v=onepage&amp;q=austroasiatic%20influence%20on%20india&amp;f=false|title=Pre-Aryan and Pre-Dravidian in India|last=Lévi|first=Sylvain|last2=Przyluski|first2=Jean|last3=Bloch|first3=Jules|date=1993|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120607729|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Austroasiatic migrations ==
[[:ja:崎谷満|Mitsuru Sakitani]] suggests that [[Haplogroup O-M95|Haplogroup O1b1]], which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in [[southern China]], and haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans]] and some [[Manchu people|Manchu]], are the carriers of Yangtze civilization ([[Baiyue]]).&lt;ref&gt;崎谷満『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』（勉誠出版　2009年）　&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the haplogroup O1b1 is the major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and O1b2 the “para-Austroasiatic” lineage of the [[Yayoi people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Z5BDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=japonic+austroasiatic#v=onepage&amp;q=japonic%20austroasiatic&amp;f=false|title=Language Dispersal Beyond Farming|last=Robbeets|first=Martine|last2=Savelyev|first2=Alexander|date=21 December 2017|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027264640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration into India ===
According to Chaubey et al., &quot;Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from [[Southeast Asia]], followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations.&quot;{{sfn|Chaubey|Metspalu|Choi|Magi|2010|p=1013}} According to Riccio et al., the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riccio |first1=M. E. |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=The Austroasiatic Munda population from India and Its enigmatic origin: a HLA diversity study |journal=Human Biology |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=405–435 |pmid=21740156 |doi=10.3378/027.083.0306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Language Gulper, [http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Austroasiatic.html ''Austroasiatic Languages'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zhang et al., Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia into India took place after the last Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years ago.{{sfn|Zhang|2015}} Arunkumar et al. suggest Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia occurred into Northeast India 5.2 ± 0.6 kya and into East India 4.3 ± 0.2 kya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arunkumar | first1 = G.  | display-authors = etal | year = 2015 | title = A late Neolithic expansion of Y chromosomal haplogroup O2a1-M95 from east to west | url = | journal = Journal of Systematics and Evolution | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 546–560 | doi = 10.1111/jse.12147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
