Marked by fierce [[close-quarters combat]] and direct assaults on civilians in [[Luftwaffe|air raids]], it remains the largest (nearly 2.2 million personnel) and [[List of battles by casualties|bloodiest]] (1.8–2 million killed, wounded or captured) battle in the history of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luhn|first1=Alec|title=Stalingrad name may return to city in wave of second world war patriotism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/stalingrad-name-may-return-to-russian-city|work=The Guardian|date=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their defeat at Stalingrad, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] had to withdraw vast military forces from the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] to replace their losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellamy2007&quot;/&gt;

The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] and elements of the [[4th Panzer Army]]. The attack was supported by intense ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].

On 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998: 239)&lt;/ref&gt; The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer1990&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shirer|1990|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|932|date=June 2011}} The battle lasted five months, one week and three days.

==Background==
By the spring of 1942, despite the failure of [[Operation Barbarossa]] to decisively defeat the [[Soviet Union]] in a single campaign, the [[Wehrmacht]] had captured vast expanses of territory, including Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics. Elsewhere, the war had been progressing well: the [[Battle of the Atlantic|U-boat offensive]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] had been very successful and [[Erwin Rommel]] had just captured [[Tobruk#Capture of Tobruk|Tobruk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw2000&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|522|date=June 2011}} In the east, they had stabilised their front in a line running from [[Leningrad]] in the north to [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] in the south. There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped. Neither Army Group North nor Army Group South had been particularly hard pressed over the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaylorClark1974&quot;&gt;Taylor and Clark, (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|144|date=June 2011}} Stalin was expecting the main thrust of the German summer attacks to be directed against Moscow again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellamy2007&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|498|date=June 2011}}

With the initial operations being very successful, the Germans decided that their summer campaign in 1942 would be directed at the southern parts of the Soviet Union. The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|88}}

On 23 July 1942, Hitler personally rewrote the operational objectives for the 1942 campaign, greatly expanding them to include the occupation of the city of Stalingrad. Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city, based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union. Hitler proclaimed that after Stalingrad's capture, its male citizens were to be killed and all women and children were to be deported because its population was &quot;thoroughly communistic&quot; and &quot;especially dangerous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burleigh2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Burleigh|title=The Third Reich: A New History|year=2001|publisher=Pan|isbn=978-0-330-48757-3|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed that the fall of the city would also firmly secure the northern and western flanks of the German armies as they advanced on [[Baku]], with the aim of securing these strategic petroleum resources for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw2000&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|528|date=June 2011}} The expansion of objectives was a significant factor in Germany's failure at Stalingrad, caused by German overconfidence and an underestimation of Soviet reserves.&lt;ref name=walsh2000&gt;Walsh, Stephen. (2000). ''Stalingrad 1942–1943 The Infernal Cauldron''. London, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-7432-0916-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets realised that they were pressed for time and resources. They ordered that anyone strong enough to hold a rifle be sent to fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|1986|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|94|date=June 2011}}

[[Army Group South]] was selected for a sprint forward through the southern Russian [[steppe]]s into the Caucasus to capture the vital Soviet [[oil field]]s [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|there]]. The planned summer offensive, [[Code name|code-named]] ''Fall Blau'' ([[Case Blue]]), was to include the German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th]], [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]], [[German Fourth Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[1st Panzer Army|1st Panzer]] Armies. Army Group South had overrun the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1941. Poised in Eastern [[Ukraine]], it was to spearhead the offensive.

Hitler intervened, however, ordering the [[Army Group]] to split in two. Army Group South (A), under the command of [[Wilhelm List]], was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including [[Friedrich Paulus]]'s 6th Army and [[Hermann Hoth]]'s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad. [[Army Group B]] was commanded by General [[Maximilian von Weichs]].&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}

[[File:German Summer Offensive, 7 May-23 July 1942.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The German advance to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] between 7 May and 23 July]]

The start of ''Case Blue'' had been planned for late May 1942. However, a number of German and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] units that were to take part in ''Blau'' were [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)|besieging Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for ''Blau'' several times, and the city did not fall until early July.

Operation Fridericus I by the Germans against the &quot;Isium bulge&quot;, pinched off the Soviet [[Salient (military)|salient]] in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], and resulted in the [[envelopment]] of a large Soviet force between 17 May and 29 May. Similarly, Operation Wilhelm attacked Voltshansk on 13 June, and Operation Fridericus attacked Kupiansk on 22 June.&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;{{Cite book |last=Adam |first=Wilhelm |first2=Otto |last2=Ruhle |translator=Tony Le Tissier |title=With Paulus at Stalingrad |publisher=Pen and Sword Books Ltd. |year=2015 |isbn=9781473833869 |pages=18, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-216-0417-19, Russland, Soldaten in Stellung.jpg|thumb|German snipers at Voronezh, June 1942]]
''Blau'' finally opened as Army Group South began its attack into southern Russia on 28 June 1942. The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a German company commander and a platoon leader]]

The initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.

By the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers are only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle. The Germans began using the armies of their [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], Hungarian and [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romanian]] allies to guard their left (northern) flank.

To the south, [[Army Group A]] was pushing far into the Caucasus, but their advance slowed as supply lines grew overextended. The two German army groups were not positioned to support one another due to the great distances involved.

After German intentions became clear in July 1942, Stalin appointed General [[Andrey Yeryomenko]] as commander of the Southeastern Front on 1 August 1942.

Beginning in late August, continuing in September and into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the Germans' northern flank. The actions resulted in more than 200,000 Soviet Army casualties but did slow the German assault.

On 23 August the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the 62nd and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city. [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Kleist]] later said after the war:&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 157&quot;&gt;Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets had enough warning of the German advance to ship grain, cattle, and railway cars across the Volga and out of harm's way, but most civilian residents were not evacuated. This &quot;harvest victory&quot; left the city short of food even before the German attack began. Before the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' reached the city itself, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had rendered the River Volga, vital for bringing supplies into the city, unusable to Soviet shipping. Between 25 and 31 July, 32 Soviet ships were sunk, with another nine crippled.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007(b)&gt;Bergström, Christer, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|69|date=May 2009}}

The battle began with the heavy bombing of the city by ''Generaloberst'' [[Wolfram von Richthofen]]'s ''[[Luftflotte 4]]'', which in the summer and autumn of 1942 was the single most powerful air [[formation (military)|formation]] in the world. Some 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped in 48 hours, more than in London at the height of the Blitz.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007&gt;{{harvnb|Bergström|2007|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|122|date=May 2009}} Stalin refused to evacuate civilian population from the city, so when bombing began 400,000 civilians were trapped within city boundaries. The exact number of civilians killed during the course of the battle is unknown but was most likely very high. Around 40,000 civilians were moved to Germany as slave workers, some fled the city during battle and a small number were evacuated by the Soviets. In February 1943 only between 10,000 to 60,000 civilians were still alive in Stalingrad. Much of the city was quickly turned to rubble, although some factories continued production while workers joined in the fighting. The [[Stalingrad Tractor Factory]] continued to turn out [[T-34 tank]]s literally until German troops burst into the plant. The [[369th (Croatian) Reinforced Infantry Regiment]] was the only non-German unit&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;Pojić, Milan. ''[http://www.naklada-ljevak.hr/knjiga/show/id/2079 Hrvatska pukovnija 369. na Istočnom bojištu 1941–1943.]''. [[Croatian State Archives]]. Zagreb, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; selected by the ''Wehrmacht'' to enter Stalingrad city during assault operations. It fought as part of the [[100th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|100th Jäger Division]].

Stalin rushed all available troops to the east bank of the Volga, some from as far away as [[Siberia]]. All the regular ferries were quickly destroyed by the Luftwaffe, which then targeted troop barges being towed slowly across the river by tugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig73(b)&quot;/&gt; It has been said that Stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city's defenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|106|date=June 2011}} Civilians, including women and children, were put to work building [[trench]]works and protective fortifications. A massive German air raid on 23 August caused a [[firestorm]], killing hundreds and turning Stalingrad into a vast landscape of rubble and burnt ruins. Ninety percent of the living space in the Voroshilovskiy area was destroyed. Between 23 and 26 August, Soviet reports indicate 955 people were killed and another 1,181 wounded as a result of the bombing.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|73|date=May 2009}} Casualties of 40,000 were greatly exaggerated,&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|188–89|date=June 2011}} and after 25 August the Soviets did not record any civilian and military casualties as a result of air raids.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Bergström quotes: Soviet Reports on the effects of air raids between 23–26 August 1942.

The [[Soviet Air Force]], the ''Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'' (VVS), was swept aside by the Luftwaffe. The VVS bases in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 August, and despite meagre reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in August, it was left with just 192 serviceable aircraft, 57 of which were fighters.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|74|date=May 2009}} The Soviets continued to pour aerial reinforcements into the Stalingrad area in late September, but continued to suffer appalling losses; the ''Luftwaffe'' had complete control of the skies.

The burden of the initial defence of the city fell on the [[1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|106|date=June 2011}} a unit made up mainly of young female volunteers who had no training for engaging ground targets. Despite this, and with no support available from other units, the AA gunners stayed at their posts and took on the advancing panzers. The [[German 16th Panzer Division]] reportedly had to fight the 1077th's gunners &quot;shot for shot&quot; until all 37 anti-aircraft guns were destroyed or overrun. The 16th Panzer was shocked to find that, due to Soviet manpower shortages, it had been fighting female soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|108|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stalingrad-info.com/stalingrad1942.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526224817/http://stalingrad-info.com/stalingrad1942.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 May 2012|title=Stalingrad 1942|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the battle, the NKVD organised poorly armed &quot;Workers' [[militia]]s&quot; similar to those that had defended the city [[Battle of Tsaritsyn|twenty-four years earlier]], composed of civilians not directly involved in war production for immediate use in the battle.

By the end of August, Army Group South (B) had finally reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. Another advance to the river south of the city followed, while the Soviets abandoned their Rossoshka position for the inner defensive ring west of Stalingrad. The wings of the 6th Army and the 4th Panzer Army met near Jablotchni along the Zaritza on 2 Sept.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|65}} By 1 September, the Soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in Stalingrad by perilous crossings of the Volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft.

On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and 66th Armies organized a massive attack against [[XIV Panzer Corps]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' helped repel the offensive by heavily attacking Soviet artillery positions and defensive lines. The Soviets were forced to withdraw at midday after only a few hours. Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack.&lt;ref name= Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|75|date=May 2009}}

[[File:62. armata a Stalingrado.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet soldiers running through trenches in the ruins of Stalingrad]]

Soviet operations were constantly hampered by the ''Luftwaffe''. On 18 September, the Soviet [[1st Guards Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards]] and 24th Army launched an offensive against VIII Army Corps at Kotluban. ''[[8th Air Corps (Germany)|VIII. Fliegerkorps]]'' dispatched wave after wave of [[Stuka]] dive-bombers to prevent a breakthrough. The offensive was repelled. The Stukas claimed 41 of the 106 Soviet tanks knocked out that morning, while escorting [[Bf 109]]s destroyed 77 Soviet aircraft.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|80|date=May 2009}}
Amid the debris of the wrecked city, the Soviet [[62nd Army|62nd]] and 64th [[Army (Soviet Army)|Armies]], which included the Soviet [[13th Guards Rifle Division]], anchored their defence lines with strong-points in houses and factories.

Fighting within the ruined city was fierce and desperate. Lieutenant General [[Alexander Rodimtsev]] was in charge of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, and received one of two Heroes of the Soviet Union awarded during the battle for his actions. Stalin's [[Order No. 227]] of 27 July 1942 decreed that all commanders who ordered unauthorised retreats would be subject to a military tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|1998|pp=84–85, 97, 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deserters and presumed malingerers were captured or executed after fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Stalin's Soldiers Fought: The Red Army's Military Effectiveness in World War II|last=Reese|first=Roger|year=2011|isbn=9780700617760|location=University Press of Kansas; First edition|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle the 62nd Army had the most arrests and executions: 203 in all, of which 49 were executed, while 139 were sent to penal companies and battalions.&lt;ref name=&quot;G.F.Krivosheev1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krivosheev|first1=G.

By 12 September, at the time of their retreat into the city, the Soviet 62nd Army had been reduced to 90 tanks, 700 mortars and just 20,000 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot; /&gt; The remaining tanks were used as immobile strong-points within the city. The initial German attack on 14 September attempted to take the city in a rush. The 51st Army Corps' 295th Infantry Division went after the Mamayev Kurgan hill, the 71st attacked the central rail station and toward the central landing stage on the Volga, while 48th Panzer Corps attacked south of the Tsaritsa River. Rodimtsev's 13th Guards Rifle Division had been hurried up to cross the river and join the defenders inside the city.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Joly, Stalingrad Battle Atlas, Volume I (Paris: 2017), 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned to counterattack at the Mamayev Kurgan and at Railway Station No. 1, it suffered particularly heavy losses.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 116-168-618, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Soldat mit MPi.jpg|thumb|left|October 1942: A German soldier with a Soviet [[PPSh-41]] [[submachine gun]] in [[Barrikady factory]] rubble]]

Though initially successful, the German attacks stalled in the face of Soviet reinforcements brought in from across the Volga. The Soviet 13th Guards Rifle Division, assigned to counterattack at the Mamayev Kurgan and at Railway Station No. 1, suffered particularly heavy losses. Over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours, and just 320 out of the original 10,000 survived the entire battle. Both objectives were retaken, but only temporarily. The railway station changed hands 14 times in six hours. By the following evening, the 13th Guards Rifle Division had ceased to exist.

Combat raged for three days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city. About fifty Red Army defenders, cut off from resupply, held the position for five days and fought off ten different assaults before running out of ammunition and water. Only forty dead Soviet fighters were found, though the Germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance. The Soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food. Paulus chose the grain elevator and silos as the symbol of Stalingrad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after a German victory.

German [[military doctrine]] was based on the principle of [[Combined arms|combined-arms teams]] and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, [[Military engineer|engineers]], artillery and [[Ground attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]]. Some Soviet commanders adopted the tactic of always keeping their front-line positions as close to the Germans as physically possible; Chuikov called this &quot;hugging&quot; the Germans. This slowed the German advance and reduced the effectiveness of the German advantage in supporting fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;russiatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=TV Novosti|title=Crucial WW2 battle remembered|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-02/Crucial_WW2_battle_remembered.html|accessdate=19 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309114524/http://russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-02/Crucial_WW2_battle_remembered.html|archivedate=9 March 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Army gradually adopted a strategy to hold for as long as possible all the ground in the city. Thus, they converted multi-floored apartment blocks, factories, warehouses, street corner residences and office buildings into a series of well defended strong-points with small 5–10-man units.&lt;ref name=&quot;russiatoday&quot;/&gt; Manpower in the city was constantly refreshed by bringing additional troops over the Volga. When a position was lost, an immediate attempt was usually made to re-take it with fresh forces.

Bitter fighting raged for every ruin, street, factory, house, basement, and staircase. Even the sewers were the sites of firefights. The Germans called this unseen [[urban warfare]] ''Rattenkrieg'' (&quot;Rat War&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=514–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room and the bedroom. Buildings had to be cleared room by room through the bombed-out debris of residential areas, office blocks, basements and apartment high-rises. Some of the taller buildings, blasted into roofless shells by earlier German aerial bombardment, saw floor-by-floor, [[close combat|close-quarters combat]], with the Germans and Soviets on alternate levels, firing at each other through holes in the floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;russiatoday&quot;/&gt; Fighting on and around [[Mamayev Kurgan]], a prominent hill above the city, was particularly merciless; indeed, the position changed hands many times.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|67–68}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig73(b)&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|?|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|1998|pp=135–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another part of the city, a Soviet [[platoon]] under the command of Sergeant [[Yakov Pavlov]] fortified a four-story building that oversaw a square 300 meters from the river bank, later called ''[[Pavlov's House]]''. The soldiers surrounded it with minefields, set up machine-gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt; The soldiers found about ten Soviet civilians hiding in the basement. They were not relieved, and not significantly reinforced, for two months. The building was labelled ''Festung'' (&quot;Fortress&quot;) on German maps. Sgt. Pavlov was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions.

The Germans made slow but steady progress through the city. Positions were taken individually, but the Germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank. By 27 Sept. the Germans occupied the southern portion of the city, but the Soviets held the centre and northern part. Most importantly, the Soviets controlled the ferries to their supplies on the east bank of the Volga.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|68}}

The Germans used aircraft, tanks and [[heavy artillery]] to clear the city with varying degrees of success. Toward the end of the battle, the gigantic [[railroad gun]] [[Dora (artillery)|nicknamed ''Dora'']] was brought into the area. The Soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the Volga. This artillery was able to bombard the German positions or at least provide counter-battery fire.

Snipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict casualties. The most famous [[Soviet sniper]] in Stalingrad was [[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Zaytsev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|1998|pp=203–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 225 confirmed kills during the battle. Targets were often soldiers bringing up food or water to forward positions. Artillery spotters were an especially prized target for snipers.

A significant historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the Red Army. The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] noted the &quot;sinister&quot; message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: &quot;The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower&quot; as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed [[SMERSH]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|154–68|date=June 2011}} On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|154–68|date=June 2011}} [[Richard Overy]] addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is &quot;easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,&quot; to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to &quot;distort our view of the Soviet war effort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Overy, Richard. Russia's War (New York: 1997), 201.&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting hundreds of interviews with Soviet veterans on the subject of terror on the Eastern Front – and specifically about Order No. 227 (&quot;Not a step back!&quot;) at Stalingrad – [[Catherine Merridale]] notes that, seemingly paradoxically, &quot;their response was frequently relief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Merridale, Catherine. Ivan's War (New York: 2006), 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Infantryman Lev Lvovich's explanation, for example, is typical for these interviews; as he recalls, &quot;[i]t was a necessary and important step. We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all – it's true – felt better. Yes, we felt better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Merridale, Catherine. Ivan's War (New York: 2006), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women fought on the Soviet side, or were under fire. As General Chuikov acknowledged, &quot;Remembering the defence of Stalingrad, I can't overlook the very important question&amp;nbsp;... about the role of women in war, in the rear, but also at the front. Equally with men they bore all the burdens of combat life and together with us men, they went all the way to Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=520–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the battle there were 75,000 women and girls from the Stalingrad area who had finished military or medical training, and all of whom were to serve in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|pp=180–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women staffed a great many of the anti-aircraft batteries that fought not only the Luftwaffe but German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet nurses not only treated wounded personnel under fire but were involved in the highly dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to the hospitals under enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|pp=189–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|pp=192–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women were not usually trained as infantry, many Soviet women fought as machine gunners, mortar operators, and scouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington p.197&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also snipers at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|pp=201–04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three air regiments at Stalingrad were entirely female.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington p.197&quot;/&gt; At least three women won the title Hero of the Soviet Union while driving tanks at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2004|pp=204–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both Stalin and Hitler, Stalingrad became a matter of prestige far beyond its strategic significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Werth]], The Year of Stalingrad (London: 1946), 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet command moved units from the Red Army strategic reserve in the Moscow area to the lower Volga, and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad region.

The strain on both military commanders was immense: Paulus developed an uncontrollable tic in his eye, which eventually afflicted the left side of his face, while Chuikov experienced an outbreak of [[eczema]] that required him to have his hands completely bandaged. Troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close-range combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|1998|pp=141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting in the industrial district===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B22437, Sowjetunion, Luftaufnahme Stalingrad.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stalingrad Tractor Factory]] in the northernmost part of the city in 1942]]

After 27 September, much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district. Having slowly advanced over 10 days against strong Soviet resistance, the 51st Army Corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of Stalingrad: the [[Red October Steel Factory]], the [[Barrikady Arms Factory]] and Stalingrad Tractor Factory. It took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all, which was unleashed on 14 October with a concentration of gunfire never seen before.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Joly, Stalingrad Battle Atlas, Volume I (2017), 340-360.&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptionally intense shelling and bombing paved the way for the first German assault groups. The main attack (led by the [[14th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|14th Panzer]] and [[305th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|305th Infantry Division]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) attacked towards the tractor factory, while another assault led by the 24th Panzer Division hit to the south of the giant plant.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Joly, Stalingrad Battle Atlas, Volume II (2017), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German onslaught crushed the [[37th Guards Rifle Division]] and in the afternoon the forward assault group reached the tractor factory before arriving at the Volga River, splitting the 62nd Army into two.&lt;ref&gt;David Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, The Stalingrad Trilogy Volume II (2009), 380–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting raged inside the Barrikady Factory until the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Joly, Stalingrad Battle Atlas, Volume II (2017), 178-302.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet-controlled area shrank down to a few strips of land along the western bank of the Volga, and in November the fighting concentrated around what Soviet newspapers referred to as &quot;Lyudnikov's Island&quot;, a small patch of ground behind the Barrikady Factory where the remnants of Colonel [[Ivan Lyudnikov]]'s [[138th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|138th Rifle Division]] resisted all ferocious assaults thrown by the Germans and became a symbol of the stout Soviet defence of Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Joly, Stalingrad Battle Atlas, Volume II (2017), 360–380.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air attacks===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J20286, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Luftangriff.jpg|thumb|[[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] dive bombers above the burning city]]
{{See also|Bombing of Stalingrad}}
From 5 to 12 September, ''Luftflotte 4'' conducted 7,507 sorties (938 per day). From 16 to 25 September, it carried out 9,746 missions (975 per day).&lt;ref name=hayward98&gt;{{harvnb|Hayward|1998|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|195|date=May 2009}} Determined to crush Soviet resistance, ''Luftflotte'' 4's ''Stukawaffe'' flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory on 5 October. Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|83|date=May 2009}}

The ''Luftwaffe'' retained [[air superiority]] into November, and Soviet daytime aerial resistance was nonexistent. However, the combination of constant air support operations on the German side and the Soviet surrender of the daytime skies began to affect the strategic balance in the air. From 28 June to 20 September, ''Luftflotte'' 4{{'s}} original strength of 1,600 aircraft, of which 1,155 were operational, fell to 950, of which only 550 were operational. The fleet's total strength decreased by 40 percent. Daily sorties decreased from 1,343 per day to 975 per day. Soviet offensives in the central and northern portions of the Eastern Front tied down Luftwaffe reserves and newly built aircraft, reducing ''Luftflotte'' 4{{'s}} percentage of Eastern Front aircraft from 60 percent on 28 June to 38 percent by 20 September. The ''Kampfwaffe'' (bomber force) was the hardest hit, having only 232 out of an original force of 480 left.&lt;ref name=hayward98&gt;{{harvnb|Hayward|1998|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|195|date=May 2009}} The ''VVS'' remained qualitatively inferior, but by the time of the Soviet counter-offensive, the ''VVS'' had reached numerical superiority.

In mid-October, after receiving reinforcements from the Caucasus theatre, the ''Luftwaffe'' intensified its efforts against remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. ''Luftflotte'' 4 flew 1,250 sorties on 14 October and its Stukas dropped 550 tonnes of bombs, while German infantry surrounded the three factories.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward 1998, pp. 194-196.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stukageschwader'' 1, 2, and 77 had largely silenced Soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the Volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing Soviet pockets of resistance. The 62nd Army had been cut in two and, due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries, was receiving much less material support. With the Soviets forced into a {{Convert|1|km|yd|adj = on|sigfig = 1|abbr = off}} strip of land on the western bank of the Volga, over 1,208 ''Stuka'' missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|84|date=May 2009}}

The Soviet bomber force, the ''Aviatsiya Dal'nego Deystviya'' ([[Long Range Aviation]]; ADD), having taken crippling losses over the past 18 months, was restricted to flying at night. The Soviets flew 11,317 night sorties over Stalingrad and the Don-bend sector between 17 July and 19 November. These raids caused little damage and were of nuisance value only.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|82|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golovanov|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|265|date=June 2011}}

On 8 November, substantial units from ''Luftflotte'' 4 were withdrawn to combat [[Operation Torch|the Allied landings in North Africa]]. The German air arm found itself spread thinly across Europe, struggling to maintain its strength in the other southern sectors of the Soviet-German front.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;8,314 German aircraft were produced from July–December 1942, but this could not keep pace with a three-front aerial war of attrition.&lt;/ref&gt;

As historian Chris Bellamy notes, the Germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into Stalingrad: the ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil-rich Caucasus, which had been Hitler's original grand-strategic objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellamy|2007|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Romanian Air Force]] was also involved in the Axis air operations at Stalingrad. Starting 23 October 1942, Romanian pilots flew a total of 4,000 sorties, during which they destroyed 61 Soviet aircraft. The Romanian Air Force lost 79 aircraft, most of them captured on the ground along with their airfields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wm_YDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1422&amp;dq=romanian+tanks+chisinau#v=snippet&amp;q=romanian Spencer C.

===Germans reach the Volga===
After three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders. Nevertheless, the fighting continued, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Battle for Stalingrad: the 1943 Soviet General Staff study.

==Soviet counter-offensives==
[[File:RIAN archive 44732 Soviet soldiers attack house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Soviet soldiers attack a house, February 1943]]

Recognising that German troops were ill-prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942, and that most of them were redeployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the [[Stavka]] decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943. These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942–1943 (19 November 1942 – 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts. According to Zhukov, ''&quot;German operational blunders were aggravated by poor intelligence: they failed to spot preparations for the major counter-offensive near Stalingrad where there were 10 field, 1 tank and 4 air armies.&quot;''&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=Pen and Sword Books Ltd. |year=1974 |isbn=9781781592915 |pages=110–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weakness on the German flanks===
During the siege, the German and allied Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's north and south flanks had pressed their [[headquarters]] for support. The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|–|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single platoon. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons. Zhukov states, &quot;Compared with the Germans, the troops of the satellites were not so well armed, less experienced and less efficient, even in defence.&quot;&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|95–96, 119, 122, 124}}

Because of the total focus on the city, the [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces had neglected for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the Don River. The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}

Similarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian 4th Army. Beyond that army, a single German division, the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Motorised Infantry]], covered 400&amp;nbsp;km. Paulus had requested permission to &quot;withdraw the 6th Army behind the Don,&quot; but was rejected. According to Paulus' comments to Adam, &quot;There is still the order whereby no commander of an army group or an army has the right to relinquish a village, even a trench, without Hitler's consent.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|87–91, 95, 129}}

===Operation Uranus: the Soviet offensive===

In autumn, the Soviet generals [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.

During the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organisation, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named &quot;Uranus&quot; and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]]. The plan was similar to the one Zhukov had used to achieve victory at [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] three years before, where he had sprung a [[pincer movement|double envelopment]] and destroyed the [[IJA 23d Division|23rd Division]] of the Japanese army.&lt;ref&gt;Maps of the conflict.

On 19 November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus. The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen. [[Nikolay Vatutin]] consisted of three complete armies, the [[Soviet First Guards Army|1st Guards Army]], 5th Tank Army and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry [[Division (military)|divisions]], eight tank [[brigade]]s, two [[Mechanized force|motorised]] brigades, six [[cavalry]] divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.

Behind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.  Army Group B was in disarray and faced strong Soviet pressure across all its fronts.  Hence it was ineffective in relieving the 6th army.

On 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]]. The Romanian forces, made up primarily of infantry, were overrun by large numbers of tanks. The Soviet forces raced west and met on 23 November at the town of Kalach, sealing the ring around Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} The link-up of the Soviet forces, not filmed at the time, was later re-enacted for a [[propaganda]] film which was shown worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

The surrounded Axis personnel comprised 265,000 Germans, Romanians, Italians,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Manstein|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} and the Croatians. In addition, the German 6th Army included between 40,000 and 65,000 ''[[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hilfswillige]]'' (''Hiwi''), or &quot;volunteer auxiliaries&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony (1999). Stalingrad. London: Penguin. p. 184. {{ISBN|0-14-024985-0}}. Beevor states that one quarter of the Sixth Army's frontline strength were ''Hiwi''. Note: this reference still does not directly support the claim that there were 40,000 ''Hiwi''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Hitler's Russian &amp; Cossack Allies 1941–45 |first=Nigel |last=Thomas |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2015 |chapter=Eastern Troops. ''Hilfswillige'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5CHCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Hiwis|isbn=978-1472806895}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used for personnel recruited amongst Soviet POWs and civilians from areas under occupation. ''Hiwi'' often proved to be reliable Axis personnel in rear areas and were used for supporting roles, but also served in some front-line units as their numbers had increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; German personnel in the pocket numbered about 210,000, according to strength breakdowns of the 20 field divisions (average size 9,000) and 100 battalion sized units of the Sixth Army on 19 November 1942. Inside the [[Pocket (military)|pocket]] ({{lang-de|[[Pocket (military)#Kessel|Kessel]]}}, literally &quot;cauldron&quot;), there were also around 10,000 Soviet civilians and several thousand Soviet soldiers the Germans had taken captive during the battle. Not all of the 6th Army was trapped: 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other two divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.

Even with the desperate situation of the Sixth Army, Army Group A continued their invasion of the Caucasus further south from 19 November until 19 December. By 19 December the German army was in full retreat out of the Caucasus, while using the Sixth Army to tie down the Soviet forces. Hence Army Group A was never used to help relieve the Sixth Army.

[[Army Group Don]] was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein. Under his command were the twenty German and two Romanian divisions encircled at Stalingrad, Adam's battle groups formed along the [[Chir River]] and on the Don bridgehead, plus the remains of the Romanian 3rd Army.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|107, 113}}

The Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: a [[circumvallation]] facing inward and a [[contravallation]] facing outward. Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]] advised Hitler not to order the 6th Army to break out, stating that he could break through the Soviet lines and relieve the besieged 6th Army.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World in Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; The American historians [[Williamson Murray]] and [[Alan Millet]] wrote that it was Manstein's message to Hitler on 24 November advising him that the 6th Army should not break out, along with Göring's statements that the Luftwaffe could supply Stalingrad that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;sealed the fate of the Sixth Army.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|133}}&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Williamson &amp; Millet, Alan ''War To Be Won'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000 p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, Manstein claimed that he told Hitler that the 6th Army must break out.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg ''A World in Arms'', 2005 451.&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that Manstein distorted his record on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, 2005 ''A World in Arms'', p. 1045.&lt;/ref&gt; Manstein was tasked to conduct a relief operation, named [[Operation Winter Storm]] (''Unternehmen Wintergewitter'') against Stalingrad, which he thought was feasible if the 6th Army was temporarily supplied through the air.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Weinberg|Weinberg, Gerhard]] ''A World at Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005, pp. 408, 449, 451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manstein 2004, pp. 315; 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] had declared in a public speech (in the [[Berlin Sportpalast]]) on 30 September 1942 that the German army would never leave the city. At a meeting shortly after the Soviet [[encirclement]], German army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the Don, but Hitler was at his Bavarian retreat of [[Obersalzberg]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] with the head of the ''Luftwaffe'', [[Hermann Göring]]. When asked by Hitler, Göring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the ''Luftwaffe'' could supply the 6th Army with an &quot;[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].&quot; This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|132}}

[[File:Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad late 1942.jpg|thumb|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad]]

The director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, Wolfram von Richthofen, tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under the 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day – based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]] to land at – was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed.&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Shirer p. 926 says that &quot;Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,&quot; while Craig pp. 206–07 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: &quot;Are you aware&amp;nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&amp;nbsp;... Seven hundred tons! Every day!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement the limited number of [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports, the Germans pressed other aircraft into the role, such as the [[Heinkel He 177]] bomber (some bombers performed adequately – the [[Heinkel He 111]] proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the Ju 52). General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by conserving the combat power of the Sixth Army and regaining the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pp. 279, 311–12, 575.&lt;/ref&gt; He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that the Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.

Supplying the 270,000 men trapped in the &quot;cauldron&quot; required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 [[Ju 52]] flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, &quot;On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|119, 127, 131, 134}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of 85 tonnes of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of 106 tonnes per day. The most successful day, 19 December, the ''Luftwaffe'' delivered 262 tonnes of supplies in 154 flights. The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft – tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions. These factors, taken together, prevented the Luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces, ensuring that they were unable to deliver the quantity of supplies needed to sustain the 6th Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Aaron|date=April 2016|title=For Want of the Means: A Logistical Appraisal of the Stalingrad Airlift|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=298–318|doi=10.1080/13518046.2016.1168137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early parts of the operation, fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city.&lt;ref name=walsh2000/&gt;{{Rp|153|date=June 2009}} Transport aircraft also evacuated technical specialists and sick or wounded personnel from the besieged enclave. Sources differ on the number flown out: at least 25,000 to at most 35,000.

Initially, supply flights came in from the field at [[Tatsinskaya Airfield|Tatsinskaya]],&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|159}} called 'Tazi' by the German pilots. On 23 December, the Soviet 24th Tank Corps, commanded by Major-General [[Vasily Badanov|Vasily Mikhaylovich Badanov]], reached nearby Skassirskaya and in the early morning of 24 December, [[Tatsinskaya Raid|the tanks reached Tatsinskaya]]. Without any soldiers to defend the airfield, it was abandoned under heavy fire; in a little under an hour, 108 Ju 52s and 16 [[Junkers Ju 86|Ju 86s]] took off for [[Novocherkassk]] – leaving 72 Ju 52s and many other aircraft burning on the ground. A new base was established some {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Stalingrad at [[Salsk]], the additional distance would become another obstacle to the resupply efforts. Salsk was abandoned in turn by mid-January for a rough facility at [[Zverevo]], near [[Shakhty]]. The field at Zverevo was attacked repeatedly on 18 January and a further 50 Ju 52s were destroyed. Winter weather conditions, technical failures, heavy Soviet [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft]] fire and fighter interceptions eventually led to the loss of 488 German aircraft.

In spite of the failure of the German offensive to reach the 6th Army, the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances. The 6th Army slowly starved. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times. After a few weeks on such a diet, he had &quot;visibly lost weight&quot;, according to [[Albert Speer]], and Hitler &quot;commanded Zeitzler to resume at once taking sufficient nourishment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=343–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toll on the ''Transportgruppen'' was heavy. 160 aircraft were destroyed and 328 were heavily damaged (beyond repair). Some 266 Junkers Ju 52s were destroyed; one-third of the fleet's strength on the Eastern Front. The He 111 ''gruppen'' lost 165 aircraft in transport operations. Other losses included 42 Ju 86s, 9 [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]] Condors, 5 He 177 bombers and 1 [[Junkers Ju 290|Ju 290]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' also lost close to 1,000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel.&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|310|date=May 2009}} So heavy were the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s losses that four of ''Luftflotte'' 4's transport units (KGrzbV 700, KGrzbV 900, I./KGrzbV 1 and II./KGzbV 1) were &quot;formally dissolved.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|122|date=May 2009}}

==End of the battle==

===Operation Winter Storm===
{{Main|Operation Winter Storm}}

Soviet forces consolidated their positions around Stalingrad, and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began. Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), the German attempt led by Erich von Manstein to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. However the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area.  The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, &quot;an early abandonment&quot; of Stalingrad &quot;would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus,&quot; and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30&amp;nbsp;km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air. Of his questions to Army Group Don, Paulus was told, &quot;Wait, implement Operation 'Thunderclap' only on explicit orders!&quot;, Operation Thunderclap being the code word initiating the breakout.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|132–33, 138–143, 150, 155, 165}}

===Operation Little Saturn===
{{Main|Operation Little Saturn}}
[[File:OperationLittleSaturn.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|Soviet gains (shown in blue) during Operation Little Saturn]]

On 16 December, the Soviets launched Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army (mainly Italians) on the Don and take Rostov-on-Don. The Germans set up a &quot;mobile defence&quot; of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the Italian Cosseria and [[3rd Infantry Division Ravenna|Ravenna]] Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strong-points, but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. &quot;'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter Müller, p. 83–84, I.B.Tauris, 28 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=978-0-275-98505-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. Sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout, Manstein pleaded with Hitler on 18 December, but Hitler refused. Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions. But in its defensive position on the Volga, the 6th Army continued to tie down a significant number of Soviet Armies.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|159, 166–67}}

On 23 December, the attempt to relieve Stalingrad was abandoned and Manstein's forces switched over to the defensive to deal with new Soviet offensives.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|153}} As Zhukov states, &quot;The military and political leadership of Nazi Germany sought not to relieve them, but to get them to fight on for as long possible so as to tie up the Soviet forces. The aim was to win as much time as possible to withdraw forces from the Caucasus (Army Group A) and to rush troops from other Fronts to form a new front that would be able in some measure to check our counter-offensive.&quot;&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|137}}

The Red Army High Command sent three envoys while simultaneously aircraft and loudspeakers announced terms of capitulation on 7 January 1943. The letter was signed by Colonel-General of Artillery Voronov and the commander-in-chief of the Don Front, Lieutenant-General Rokossovsky. A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain [[Nikolay Dyatlenko]] and a trumpeter) carried an offer to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings, &quot;normal&quot; food rations, and [[repatriation]] to any country they wished after the war; but Paulus – ordered not to surrender by Hitler – did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1995|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|283|date=June 2011}} The German High Command informed Paulus, &quot;Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|166, 168–69}}

The Germans were now not only starving, but running out of ammunition. Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''HiWis'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody urban warfare began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defence of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility.

On 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast &quot;to the last soldier and the last bullet.&quot; Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a &quot;heroic drama of German history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January, in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported &quot;18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|193}}

On 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamai-Kurgan. The northern pocket consisting of the VIIIth Corps, under General [[Walter Heitz]], and the XIth Corps, was now cut off from telephone communication with Paulus in the southern pocket. Now &quot;each part of the cauldron came personally under Hitler.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|201, 203}} On 28 January, the cauldron was split into three parts. The northern cauldron consisted of the XIth Corps, the central with the VIIIth and LIst Corps, and the southern with the XIVth Panzer Corps and IVth Corps &quot;without units&quot;. The sick and wounded reached 40,000 to 50,000.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|203}}

On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of Hitler's coming to power, Goebbels read out a proclamation that included the sentence: &quot;The heroic struggle of our soldiers on the Volga should be a warning for everybody to do the utmost for the struggle for Germany's freedom and the future of our people, and thus in a wider sense for the maintenance of our entire continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler promoted Paulus to the rank of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]''. No German field marshal had ever surrendered, and the implication was clear: if Paulus surrendered, he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking German officer ever to be captured. Hitler believed that Paulus would either fight to the last man or commit suicide.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|212}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellamy|2007|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the next day, the southern pocket in Stalingrad collapsed. Soviet forces reached the entrance to the German headquarters in the ruined [[State Universal Store|GUM]] department store. General Schmidt negotiated a surrender of the headquarters while Paulus was unaware in another room.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|207–08, 212–15}} When interrogated by the Soviets, Paulus claimed that he had not surrendered. He said that he had been taken by surprise. He denied that he was the commander of the remaining northern pocket in Stalingrad and refused to issue an order in his name for them to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, p.&amp;nbsp;390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellamy|2007|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central pocket, under the command of Heitz, surrendered the same day, while the northern pocket, under the command of [[Karl Strecker]], held out for two more days.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;{{rp|215}} When Strecker finally surrendered he and his Chief of Staff, [[Helmuth Groscurth]], drafted the final signal sent from Stalingrad, purposely omitting the customary exclamation to Hitler, replacing it with &quot;Long live Germany!&quot;{{snf|Beevor|1998}}

Four Soviet armies were deployed against the remaining northern pocket. At four in the morning on 2 February, General Strecker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the Soviets to negotiate surrender terms. Seeing no point in continuing, he sent a radio message saying that his command had done its duty and fought to the last man. He then surrendered. Around 91,000 exhausted, ill, wounded, and starving prisoners were taken, including 3,000 Romanians (the survivors of the 20th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division and &quot;Col.

==Casualties==
The calculation of casualties depends on what scope is given to the Battle of Stalingrad. The scope can vary from the fighting in the city and suburbs to the inclusion of almost all fighting on the southern wing of the Soviet–German front from the spring of 1942 to the end of the fighting in the city in the winter of 1943. Scholars have produced different estimates depending on their definition of the scope of the battle. The difference is comparing the city against the region. The Axis suffered 647,300 – 968,374 total casualties (killed, wounded or captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies:
* 282,606 in the 6th Army from 21 August to the end of the battle; 17,293 in the 4th Panzer Army from 21 August to 31 January; 55,260 in the [[Army Group Don]] from 1 December 1942 to the end of the battle (12,727 killed, 37,627 wounded and 4,906 missing)&lt;ref name=&quot;Archived copy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec43.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 December 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525020822/http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec43.html |archivedate=25 May 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined German losses of 6th Army and 4th Panzer were over 300,000 men.

The situation of the Romanian tanks is known, however. Before ''Operation Uranus'', the 1st Romanian Armoured Division consisted of 121 [[Panzer 35(t)|R-2]] light tanks and 19 German-produced tanks ([[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV|IV]]). All of the 19 German tanks were lost, as well as 81 of the R-2 light tanks. Only 27 of the latter were lost in combat, however, the remaining 54 being abandoned after breaking down or running out of fuel. Ultimately, however, Romanian armoured warfare proved to be a tactical success, as the Romanians destroyed 127 Soviet tanks for the cost of their 100 lost units. Romanian forces destroyed 62 Soviet tanks on 20 November for the cost of 25 tanks of their own, followed by 65 more Soviet tanks on 22 November, for the cost of 10 tanks of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Zaloga, ''Tanks of Hitler’s Eastern Allies 1941–45'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2013, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; More Soviet tanks were destroyed as they overran the Romanian airfields. This was accomplished by Romanian [[Vickers Model 1931|Vickers/Reșița]] 75&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns, which proved effective against Soviet armour. The battle for the German-Romanian airfield at Karpova lasted two days, with Romanian gunners destroying numerous Soviet tanks.

The losses of transport planes were especially serious, as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th Army. The destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at Tatsinskaya was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the Luftwaffe transport fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|1999|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These losses amounted to about 50 percent of the aircraft committed and the Luftwaffe training program was stopped and sorties in other theatres of war were significantly reduced to save fuel for use at Stalingrad.

The German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement.&lt;ref name=Lose/&gt; Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort. On 31 January, regular programmes on German state radio were replaced by a broadcast of the sombre Adagio movement from [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]], followed by the announcement of the defeat at Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=Lose&gt;Sandlin, Lee (1997). [http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm &quot;Losing the War&quot;]. Originally published in ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', 7 and 14 March 1997. Retrieved 4 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February, [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] gave the famous [[Sportpalast speech|''Sportpalast'' speech]] in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a [[total war]] that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.

Based on Soviet records, over 10,000 German soldiers continued to resist in isolated groups within the city for the next month.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some have presumed that they were motivated by a belief that fighting on was better than a slow death in Soviet captivity. Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory.&lt;ref name=Bartov&gt;Bartov, Omer ''Hitler's Army'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991 pp.&amp;nbsp;166–67&lt;/ref&gt; Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to &quot;sacrifice themselves for the Führer&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bartov/&gt;

The remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers but by early March 1943, the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered. According to Soviet intelligence documents shown in the documentary, a remarkable NKVD report from March 1943 is available showing the tenacity of some of these German groups:

{{quote|The mopping-up of counter-revolutionary elements in the city of Stalingrad proceeded. The German soldiers – who had hidden themselves in huts and trenches – offered armed resistance after combat actions had already ended. This armed resistance continued until 15 February and in a few areas until 20 February. Most of the armed groups were liquidated by March&amp;nbsp;... During this period of armed conflict with the Germans, the brigade's units killed 2,418 soldiers and officers and captured 8,646 soldiers and officers, escorting them to POW camps and handing them over.}}

The operative report of the Don Front's staff issued on 5 February 1943, 22:00 said,

{{quote|The 64th Army was putting itself in order, being in previously occupied regions. Location of army's units is as it was previously. In the region of location of the 38th Motorised Rifle Brigade in a basement eighteen armed SS-men (sic) were found, who refused to surrender, the Germans found were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Google Video: {{cite video|title=Stalingrad – OSA III – Stalingradin taistelu päättyy (Stalingrad, Part 3: Battle of Stalingrad ends) |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8717261858113724758 |format=Adobe Flash |medium=Television documentary.

The condition of the troops that surrendered was pitiful. British war correspondent [[Alexander Werth]] described the following scene in his ''Russia at War'' book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad on 3–5 February 1943,

{{quote|We [...] went into the yard of the large burnt out building of the Red Army House; and here one realised particularly clearly what the last days of Stalingrad had been to so many of the Germans. In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more {{sic|?|more}} horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible [[cesspool]] – fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure. He had been crouching over another cesspool, and now, noticing us, he was hastily pulling up his pants, and then he slunk away into the door of the basement. But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face – with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans—dying of hunger and frostbite. &quot;We haven't had time to deal with them yet,&quot; one of the Russians said. &quot;They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.&quot; And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up – men who had died in that basement—about a dozen wax-like dummies. We did not go into the basement itself – what was the use? There was nothing we could do for them.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Werth, Russia at War 1941–1945, New York, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co, Inc., 1964, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Out of the nearly 91,000 German prisoners captured in Stalingrad, only about 5,000 returned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3664526/How-three-million-Germans-died-after-VE-Day.html How three million Germans died after VE Day.] Nigel Jones reviews ''After the Reich: From the Liberation of Vienna to the Berlin Airlift'' by [[Giles MacDonogh]]. ''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]'', 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Weakened by disease, starvation and lack of medical care during the encirclement, they were sent on foot marches to prisoner camps and later to [[labour camp]]s all over the Soviet Union. Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly [[typhus]]), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild it.

A handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]]. Some, including Paulus, signed anti-Hitler statements that were broadcast to German troops. Paulus testified for the prosecution during the Nuremberg Trials and assured families in Germany that those soldiers taken prisoner at Stalingrad were safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig73(b)&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|401|date=January 2013}} He remained in the Soviet Union until 1952, then moved to Dresden in East Germany, where he spent the remainder of his days defending his actions at Stalingrad and was quoted as saying that Communism was the best hope for postwar Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craig73(b)&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|280|date=May 2009}} General [[Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach]] offered to raise an anti-Hitler army from the Stalingrad survivors, but the Soviets did not accept. It was not until 1955 that the last of the 5,000–6,000 survivors were [[Repatriation|repatriated]] (to [[West Germany]]) after a plea to the [[Politburo]] by [[Konrad Adenauer]].

==Significance==
Stalingrad has been described as the biggest defeat in the history of the German Army.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|1998|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often identified as the turning point on the Eastern Front, in the war against Germany overall, and in the entire Second World War.&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|142}}&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Corrigan, ''The Second World War: a Military History'', Atlantic, London, p 353.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp. 95, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army had the initiative, and the Wehrmacht was in retreat. A year of German gains during Case Blue had been wiped out. Germany's Sixth Army had ceased to exist, and the forces of Germany's European allies, except Finland, had been shattered.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts, ''Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech on 9 November 1944, Hitler himself blamed Stalingrad for Germany's impending doom.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Beevor, ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', Penguin Books, London, 2007, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of an entire army (the largest killed, captured, wounded figures for Axis soldiers, nearly 1&amp;nbsp;million, during the war) and the frustration of Germany's grand strategy made the battle a watershed moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107&quot;&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the global significance of the battle was not in doubt. Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected on the change in the position from a year before:

{{quote|I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India]], etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe. There is a hope of clearing North Africa of Germans in the near future... Russia is scoring wonderful successes in Southern Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107&quot;/&gt;}}

At this point, the British had won the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 300,000 to 400,000 Germans had been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107&quot;/&gt;

Regardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt about Stalingrad's symbolism. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. Joseph Goebbels read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp. 104–05, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: &quot;You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.&quot; Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 106&quot;&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the battle echoed round the world, with many people now believing that Hitler's defeat was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts, ''Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2006, pp. 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkey|Turkish]] Consul in Moscow predicted that &quot;the lands which the Germans have destined for their [[lebensraum|living space]] will become their dying space&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 95&quot;&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's conservative ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' proclaimed that the victory had saved European civilisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 95&quot;/&gt; The country celebrated &quot;Red Army Day&quot; on 23 February 1943. A ceremonial [[Sword of Stalingrad]] was forged by King George VI. After being put on public display in Britain, this was presented to Stalin by Winston Churchill at the [[Tehran Conference]] later in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 106&quot;/&gt; Soviet propaganda spared no effort and wasted no time in capitalising on the triumph, impressing a global audience. The prestige of Stalin, the Soviet Union, and the worldwide Communist movement was immense, and their political position greatly enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title [[Hero City]] in 1945. A colossal monument called [[The Motherland Calls]] was erected in 1967 on Mamayev Kurgan, the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinters can still be found.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Memorial Complex &quot;To the Heroes of the Stalingrad Battle&quot; at Mamayev Hill.
