==History==
[[File:beech.bonanza.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|1978 [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Beech Bonanza F33C]]]]

Beech Aircraft Company was founded in [[Wichita, Kansas]], in 1932 by [[Walter Beech]] as president, his wife [[Olive Ann Beech]] as secretary, [[Ted A. Wells]] as vice president of engineering, K. K. Shaul as treasurer, and investor C. G. Yankey as vice president. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Edward H.|title=The staggerwing story : a history of the Beechcraft model 17|date=1996|publisher=Flying Books International|location=Eagan, Minn.|isbn=9780911139273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began operations in an idle [[Cessna]] factory. With designer Ted Wells, they developed the first aircraft under the Beechcraft name, the classic [[Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing]], which first flew in November 1932. Over 750 Staggerwings were built, with 270 manufactured for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Beechcraft was not Beech's first company, as he had previously formed [[Travel Air]] in 1924 and the design numbers used at Beechcraft followed the sequence started at Travel Air, and were then continued at Curtiss-Wright, after Travel Air had been absorbed into the much larger company in 1929. Beech became president of the Curtiss-Wright's airplane division and VP of sales, but became dissatisfied with being so far removed from aircraft production and quit to form Beechcraft, using the original Travel Air facilities and employing many of the same people. Model numbers prior to 11/11000 were built under the &quot;Travel Air&quot; name, while Curtiss-Wright built the CW-12, 14, 15, and 16 as well as previous successful Travel Air models (mostly the model 4).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Beech Aircraft Corporation ad Model 17 &quot;Staggerwing&quot; 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for Model 17 &quot;Staggerwing&quot; 1937]]

In 1942 Beech won its first [[Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award]] production award and became one of the elite five percent of war contracting firms in the country to win five straight awards for production efficiency, mostly for the production of the [[Beechcraft Model 18]] which remains in widespread use worldwide. Beechcraft ranked 69th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Staggerwing was replaced by the revolutionary [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] with a distinctive [[V-tail]]. Perhaps the best known Beech aircraft, the single-engined Bonanza has been manufactured in various models since 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;PL&quot;/&gt; The Bonanza has had the longest production run of any airplane, past or present, in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amtonline.com/article/article.jsp?siteSection=1&amp;id=3901 |title=Hawker Beechcraft Corporation Celebrates Beechcraft 75th Anniversary, American Management Technology |date=July 8, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930065152/http://www.amtonline.com/article/article.jsp?siteSection=1&amp;id=3901 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important Beech aircraft are the [[Beechcraft King Air|King Air]] and [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Super King Air]] line of twin-engined turboprops, in production since 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;PL&quot;&gt;[http://www.hawkerbeechcraft.com/service_support/pubs/docs/nontechnical/serializationList.pdf Hawker Beechcraft production lists, 1945 – present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411082140/http://www.hawkerbeechcraft.com/service_support/pubs/docs/nontechnical/serializationList.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }} retrieved November 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Beechcraft Baron|Baron]], a twin-engined variant of the Bonanza, and the Beechcraft Model 18, originally a business transport and commuter airliner from the late 1930s through the 1960s, which remains in active service as a cargo transport.

In 1950, Olive Ann Beech was installed as president and CEO of the company, after the sudden death of her husband from a heart attack on November 29 of that year. She continued as CEO until Beech was purchased by [[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] on February 8, 1980. Ted Wells had been replaced as chief engineer by Herbert Rawdon, who remained at the post until his retirement in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://napoleon130.tripod.com/id882.html|title=Beech Aircraft Corporation, Wichita|website=napoleon130.tripod.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medallicartcollector.com/carl-paul-jennewein_medals.html|title=Artist Page|website=medallicartcollector.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout much of the 20th century, Beechcraft was considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; in the field of general aviation manufacturing, along with [[Cessna]] and [[Piper Aircraft]].  

In 1994, Raytheon merged Beechcraft with the Hawker product line it had acquired in 1993 from [[British Aerospace]], forming [[Raytheon Aircraft Company]]. In 2002, the Beechcraft brand was revived to again designate the Wichita-produced aircraft. In 2006, Raytheon sold Raytheon Aircraft to Goldman Sachs creating [[Hawker Beechcraft]]. Since its inception Beechcraft has resided in [[Wichita, Kansas]], also the home of chief competitor Cessna, the birthplace of [[Learjet]] and of [[Stearman Aircraft|Stearman]], whose trainers were used in large numbers during WW II.

The entry into bankruptcy of [[Hawker Beechcraft]] on May 3, 2012 ended with its emergence on February 16, 2013 as a new entity, Beechcraft Corporation, with the Hawker Beechcraft name being retired. The new and much smaller company produce the King Air line of aircraft as well as the T-6 and AT-6 military trainer/attack aircraft, as well as the piston-powered single-engined Bonanza and twin-engined Baron aircraft. The jet line was discontinued, but the new company continues to support the aircraft already produced with parts, plus engineering and airworthiness documentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles19Feb13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew03May12&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/hawker_beechcraft_bankruptcy_restructuring_wichita_court_debt_layoff_206639-1.html|title = Bankruptcy For Hawker Beechcraft |accessdate = February 19, 2013|last = Pew|first = Glenn|date = May 3, 2012| work = AVweb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2013, the company, now financially turned around, was up for sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles17Oct13&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Beechcraft-For-Sale-Report220802-1.html|title = Beechcraft For Sale|accessdate = October 18, 2013|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = October 17, 2013| work = AVweb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 2013, [[Textron]] agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was concluded in the first half of 2014, with government approval. Textron CEO Scott Donnelly indicated that Beechcraft and Cessna would be combined to form a new light aircraft manufacturing concern, [[Textron Aviation]], that would result in US$65M-$85M in annual savings over keeping the companies separate.&lt;ref name=&quot;avweb1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=AVweb Staff |url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Textron-Confirms-Beech-Acquisition-Updated221180-1.html |title=Textron Confirms Beech Acquisition |publisher=Avweb |date=December 26, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles30Dec13&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Textron-Fleshes-Out-Beech-Deal221194-1.html|title = Textron Fleshes Out Beech Deal|accessdate = December 30, 2013|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = December 30, 2013| work = AVweb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansas.com/2013/12/26/3197897/textron-buys-beechcraft-in-14.html Textron buys Beechcraft in $1.4 billion deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227172111/http://www.kansas.com/2013/12/26/3197897/textron-buys-beechcraft-in-14.html |date=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/textron-to-buy-beechcraft-parent-for-14bn/112043.article|title=Textron to buy Beechcraft parent for $1.4bn|first=Greg|last=Waldron|date=2013-12-27|website=Flight Global}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textron has kept both the Beechcraft and Cessna names as separate brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/bav_01_06_2014_p01-01-651001.xml|title=Textron Looks To Keep Beechcraft As Separate Brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;
