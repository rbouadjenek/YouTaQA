{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon''' is a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which, according to adherents, contains writings of ancient [[prophet]]s who lived on the [[Americas|American continent]] from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinckley|first=Gordon B.|author-link=Gordon B. Hinckley|title=Joseph Smith: 'Praise to the Man'|url=https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_joseph-smith-praise-man/|website=BYU.edu|date=November 4, 1979|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in March 1830 by [[Joseph Smith]] as ''The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as &quot;[[reformed Egyptian]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mormon|morm|9|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; engraved on [[golden plates]]. Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], buried it in the [[Cumorah|Hill Cumorah]] in present-day [[Manchester, New York]] before his death, and then appeared in vision to Smith in 1827 as an [[Angel Moroni|angel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|pp=11, 18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; revealing the location of the plates, and instructing him to translate the plates into English for use in the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of Christ's true church in the [[End time#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|latter days]]. Critics claim that it was authored by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner Shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot;/&gt;

The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the [[fall of man|fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|Christian atonement]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eschatology]], redemption from physical and spiritual death,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{lds|Alma|alma|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|latter-day church]]. The pivotal event of the book is an [[Book of Mormon chronology#The coming of Christ|appearance of Jesus Christ]] in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.

The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the [[Standard works|unique writings]] of the Latter-day Saint movement, the [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture, and secondarily as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name = bomintroduction/&gt; The archaeological, historical, and scientific communities do not accept the Book of Mormon as an ancient record of actual historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Simon G. Southerton. ''Losing a Lost Tribe:  Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church'' (2004, Signature Books).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in English very similar to the [[Early Modern English]] linguistic style of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 111 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{|url=https://lds365.com/translations-of-the-book-of-mormon/|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon had been printed.&lt;ref name = 150million/&gt;

{{Main|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Golden plates|Criticism of the Book of Mormon}}
According to Joseph Smith, he was seventeen &lt;!-- do not edit age, JS was 17 at time of Moroni visit, see refs for clarification --&gt;years of age when an angel of God named [[Angel Moroni|Moroni]] appeared to him&lt;ref name=&quot;life-js&quot;&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/content/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith &quot;The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith&quot;], ''[[Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith]]'' (2007), xxii–25.&lt;/ref&gt; and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a [[Cumorah|nearby hill]] in present-day [[Wayne County, New York]], engraved on [[golden plates]] by ancient prophets. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823 and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill; was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that, in four years from this date, the time would arrive for &quot;bringing them forth&quot;, i.e., translating them. Smith's description of these events recounts that he was allowed to take the plates on September 22, 1827, exactly four years from that date, and was directed to translate them into English.&lt;ref name=&quot;life-js&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|''Pearl of Great Price,'' [[Joseph Smith–History]]|js_h|1|59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts vary of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon. Smith himself implied that he read the plates directly using spectacles prepared for the purpose of translating.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5552 |title= Book of Mormon Translation By Joseph Smith |pages= 210–213 |last1= Rathbone |first1= Tim |last2= Welch |first2= John W. |author2-link= John W.

Smith's first published description of the plates said that the plates &quot;had the appearance of gold&quot;. They were described by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], one of Smith's early scribes, as &quot;fastened together in the shape of a book by wires.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph, Jr. |authorlink= Joseph Smith |title= Wentworth Letter/Church History | place= [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] |journal=[[Times and Seasons]] |date= March 1, 1842 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages= 906–936 |url= http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith called the engraved writing on the plates &quot;[[reformed Egyptian]]&quot;. A portion of the text on the plates was also &quot;[[Golden plates#&quot;Sealed&quot; portion|sealed]]&quot; according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others stated that they saw the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction/1 &quot;Testimony of Three Witnesses&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction/1?lang=eng &quot;Testimony of Eight Witnesses&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; These statements have been published in most editions of the Book of Mormon.

Smith enlisted his neighbor [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] as a scribe during his initial work on the text. (Harris later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon.) In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife [[Lucy Harris]], repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris's requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the [[Lost 116 pages|first 116 pages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]], [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 3|section 3]] and&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates (in what is now called the Book of Mosiah). In 1829, work resumed on the Book of Mormon, with the assistance of [[Oliver Cowdery]], and was completed in a short period (April–June 1829).&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]] (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 70.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said that he then returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction/1?lang=eng &quot;Testimony of Joseph Smith&quot;] {{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon went on sale at the bookstore of [[E.

[[Image:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|left|Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by [[Joseph Smith]]&lt;br /&gt;(Image from the U.S. Library of Congress ''Rare Book and Special Collections Division''.)]]

===Title===
Smith said the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of &quot;the very last leaf&quot; of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith stated that the &quot;title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other man's who has lived or does live in this generation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times and Seasons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph |authorlink= |date=October 1842 |title=Truth Will Prevail |journal=Times and Seasons |volume=III |issue=24 |page=943 |id= |url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n24.htm#943 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is &quot;to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; ... and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title/1 Title Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the [[First Book of Nephi]] (1 Nephi) and ending with the [[Book of Moroni]].

The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the [[Words of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Ether]]. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether and writing the latter part of Mormon and the Book of Moroni).

Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the &quot;Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]&quot; and the &quot;Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]]&quot;.

===Chronology===
{{Main|Book of Mormon chronology}}
The books from [[Book of First Nephi|First Nephi]] to [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are described as being from &quot;the small plates of Nephi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|''Book of Mormon,'' Words of Mormon|w_of_m|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account begins in ancient [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the [[Babylonians]] in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the [[Arabian peninsula]], and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|18|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s, that frequently warred with each other.

Following this section is the [[Words of Mormon]]. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], is a short introduction to the books of [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]], [[Book of Alma|Alma]], [[Book of Helaman|Helaman]], [[Book of Third Nephi|Third Nephi]], and [[Book of Fourth Nephi|Fourth Nephi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief-explanation&quot;&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/explanation/1 &quot;A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called &quot;the large plates of Nephi&quot; that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The [[Book of Third Nephi]] is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the [[Americas]] sometime after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the [[Gospels]] of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.

The portion of the greater Book of Mormon called the [[Book of Mormon (Mormon's record)|Book of Mormon]] is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.

According to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the [[Book of Ether]]) of a record from a previous people called the [[Jaredites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief-explanation&quot;/&gt; The account describes a group of families led from the [[Tower of Babel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Americas, headed by a man named [[Jared (Book of Mormon)|Jared]] and [[The Brother of Jared|his brother]]. The [[Jaredite]] civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L. Allen, ''Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands'' (2003) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;—long before Lehi's family arrived shortly after 600 BC—and as being much larger and more developed.

The [[Book of Moroni]] then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] state of the remaining society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/1 &quot;Book of Moroni&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes significant doctrinal teachings and closes with Moroni's [[testimony]] and an invitation to [[prayer|pray]] to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrinal and philosophical teachings===

The Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary J. Coleman]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2002/01/the-book-of-mormon-a-guide-for-the-old-testament &quot;The Book of Mormon: A Guide for the Old Testament&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to political and ideological teachings. Jesus is mentioned every 1.7 verses and is referred to by one hundred different names.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Ward Easton]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1978/07/discovery/names-of-christ-in-the-book-of-mormon &quot;Names of Christ in the Book of Mormon&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jesus====
Stated on the title page, the Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the &quot;convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit &quot;without flesh and blood&quot;, although with a spirit &quot;body&quot; that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Ether|ether|3|16&quot;&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|3|16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is described as &quot;the Father and the Son&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|3|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to be: &quot;God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people ... [b]eing the Father and the Son—the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son—and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|15|1|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as &quot;one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|19|22|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, beliefs among the churches of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] encompass [[nontrinitarian]]ism (in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) to [[trinitarianism]] (in the [[Community of Christ]]). See [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)]].

In furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|11}} to {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the book's contributors described other visions of Jesus, including one by the [[Brother of Jared]] who, according to the book, lived before Jesus, and saw the &quot;body&quot; of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Ether|ether|3|16&quot;/&gt; According to the book, a [[Nephi, son of Lehi|narrator named Nephi]] described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a prophecy of Jesus' name,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|10|4}}, {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|19|8}}; See also {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative, at the time of [[King Benjamin]] (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called &quot;the children of Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of [[Captain Moroni]] (73 BC) were called &quot;Christians&quot; by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|46|13|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|4 Nephi|1|22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the prophet [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] worked to convince the faithless people of his time (AD 360) of Christ. Many other prophets in the book write of the reality of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

In the Bible, Jesus spoke to the [[Jew]]s in [[Jerusalem]] of &quot;other sheep&quot; who would hear his voice.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|John|john|10|16}} in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon claims this meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|lost tribes]] of [[Israel]] throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|15|13|24}}, {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|16|1|4}}, {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|29|7|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teachings about political theology====
The book delves into [[political theology]] within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are [[American exceptionalism]]. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a &quot;land of promise&quot;, the world's most exceptional land of the time.&lt;!--

On the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to &quot;defend themselves against their enemies&quot;. However, they were never to &quot;give an offense,&quot; or to &quot;raise their sword ... except it were to preserve their lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|48|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book praises the faith of [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|a group]] of former warriors who took an oath of complete [[pacifism]], refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Alma|alma|24&quot;&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2,000 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in their battles the 2,000 men were protected by God through their faith and, though many were injured, none of them died.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|56|47-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book recommends monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Alma|alma|24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|29|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked, and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosial|29|18-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosial|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Helaman|hel|6|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When citizens referred to as &quot;king-men&quot; attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|62|9|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19&quot;&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of &quot;substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|1|26|27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, all the citizens held their property in common.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19&quot;/&gt; When individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to &quot;wear costly apparel&quot;, and otherwise engage in wickedness for personal gain, such societies are repeatedly portrayed in the book as being ripe for destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|13|13|14}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|4:6}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|5:53}}; {{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
=== Joseph Smith ===
[[Joseph Smith]] characterized the Book of Mormon as the &quot;keystone&quot; of Mormonism, and claimed that it was &quot;the most correct of any book on earth&quot;.&lt;ref name = bomintroduction&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction/1|title=Introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Joseph Smith |editor= [[B.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or [[standard works]] of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;The other texts are the [[Bible]] ([[King James Version]]), the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]: {{citation |last= Nelson |first= Russell M. |authorlink= Russell M.

For most of the history of the LDS Church, the Book of Mormon was not used as much as other books of scripture such as the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stack |first1=Peggy Fletcher |title=And it came to pass, one day the Book of Mormon overtook the Bible — in LDS eyes |url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2139857&amp;itype=CMSID&amp;fullpage=1 |accessdate=17 February 2020 |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed in the 1980s when efforts were made to reemphasize the Book of Mormon. As part of this effort, a new edition was printed
with the added subtitle &quot;Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/1988-01-02/since-1982-subtitle-has-defined-book-as-another-testament-of-jesus-christ-738 &quot;Since 1982, subtitle has defined book as 'another testament of Jesus Christ'&quot;], ''[[Church News]]'', 1988-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/book-of-mormon &quot;Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot;], mormonnewsroom.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boyd K.

The importance of the Book of Mormon was a focus of [[Ezra Taft Benson]], the church's thirteenth [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]].&lt;ref name = bensonkeystone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1986/05/cleansing-the-inner-vessel &quot;Cleansing the Inner Vessel&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]], May 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson stated that the church was still under condemnation for treating the Book of Mormon lightly.&lt;ref name = floodingtheearth&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1988/11/flooding-the-earth-with-the-book-of-mormon &quot;Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dallin H. Oaks]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/03/another-testament-of-jesus-christ &quot;'Another Testament of Jesus Christ'&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', March 1994 (reporting that Benson told a meeting of church leaders on 5 March 1987 that &quot;[t]his condemnation has not been lifted, nor will it be until we repent&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2005 message, LDS Church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] challenged each member of the church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/08/a-testimony-vibrant-and-true &quot;A Testimony Vibrant and True&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], at special devotionals by [[General Authority|general authorities]], and in the church's teaching publications. Since the late 1980s, church members have been encouraged to read from the Book of Mormon daily.&lt;ref name = floodingtheearth/&gt;

The LDS Church encourages discovery of the book's truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is sometimes referred to as &quot;Moroni's Promise&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|3|5}}; see {{citation |last= Cook |first= Gene R. |authorlink= Gene R. Cook |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/04/moronis-promise |title= Moroni's Promise |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=April 1994 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2011, the LDS Church has published more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Mormon: 150 Million Copies|url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2011-04-22/book-of-mormon-150-million-copies-36961|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community of Christ===
The [[Community of Christ]], formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, [[Herald House]]: the Authorized Edition, which is based on the original printer's manuscript, and the 1837 Second Edition (or &quot;Kirtland Edition&quot;) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 &quot;Revised Authorized Edition,&quot; which attempts to modernize some language.

In 2001, Community of Christ President [[W. Grant McMurray]] reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: &quot;The proper use of the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, W. Grant, [https://archive.today/20050218115333/http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp &quot;They 'Shall Blossom as the Rose': Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,&quot;] an address delivered February 17, 2001, cofchrist.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President [[Stephen M. Veazey]] ruled out-of-order a resolution to &quot;reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record.&quot; He stated that &quot;while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Shields, &quot;Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007,&quot; in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greater Latter Day Saint movement ===
There are a number of other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|churches]] that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=B.A. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds.htm |title=The LDS Restorationist movement, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |website=ReligiousTolerance.org |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.

==Historical authenticity==
{{Main|Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon}}
{{See also|Criticism of the Book of Mormon|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon anachronisms}}

Most of the archaeological, historical and scientific communities do not consider the Book of Mormon an ancient record of actual historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Simon G. Southerton. ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church'' (2004, Signature Books, passim)&lt;br&gt;Page xv: &quot;Anthropolgists and archaeologists, including some Mormons and former Mormons, have discovered little to support the existence of [Book of Mormon] civilizations.  Over a period of 150 years, as scholars have seriously studied Native American cultures and prehistory, evidence of a Christian civilization in the Americas has eluded the specialists...These [Mesoamerican] cultures lack any trace of Hebrew or Egyptian writing, metallurgy, or the Old World domesticated animals and plants described in the Book of Mormon.&quot;&lt;br&gt;While most scientific organizations simply ignore the Book of Mormon just as they ignore the Bible and other religious books as sources of scientific information ([https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/]), the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic Society have issued explicit denials that the Book of Mormon has ever been used in scientific research sponsored by their organizations.&lt;br&gt;The Book of Mormon is often included in lists of archeological &quot;hoaxes&quot; such as &quot;Williams takes on the Cardiff Giant, the Grave Creek Stone, the Lenape Stone, the Holly Oak Pendant, the Walam Olum, the Paleolithic tools of the Trenton Gravels, Atlantis, Mu, the book of Mormon and its associated finds of Holy Stones, various and sundry rune stones, Thor Heyerdahl, the Tucson Crosses, Mystery Hill, George Carter's pre-pre-Clovis occupations of North America, &quot;psychic archaeology,&quot; and other &quot;fantasies.&quot;&quot; Jay F. Custer, &quot;Review of 'Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory' by Stephen Williams&quot;, ''American Antiquity'' (1993) 58:372-373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The exceptions are several LDS organizations that sponsor historical and archeological research, such as [[FairMormon]], [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]], and [[Brigham Young University]]; and LDS journals.&lt;/ref&gt; Their skepticism tends to focus on four main areas:
* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and known, intact American archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): &quot;As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-[[Pleistocene]], [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America, frequently referred to as [[anachronisms]]. Items typically listed include [[cattle]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Nephi 18:25&lt;br /&gt;LDS scholars think that this may be a product of reassigning familiar labels to unfamiliar items. For example, the Delaware Indians named the cow after the deer, and the Miami Indians labeled sheep, when they were first seen, &quot;looks-like-a cow.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;John L. Sorenson, An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City, Utah : Deseret Book Co.; Provo, Utah : Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1996 [1985]), 294. {{ISBN|1-57345-157-6}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402233718/http://www.mormonfortress.com/cows1.html |date=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[horse]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;1 Nephi 18:25&quot;&gt;1 Nephi 18:25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donkey|asses]],&lt;ref name=&quot;1 Nephi 18:25&quot;/&gt; [[ox]]en,&lt;ref name=&quot;1 Nephi 18:25&quot;/&gt; [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], [[swine]], [[goat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;1 Nephi 18:25&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.irr.org/mit/smithsonian.html Smithsonian Institution statement on the Book of Mormon] paragraph 4 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520134005/http://www.irr.org/mit/smithsonian.html |date=May 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[elephant]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ether 9:19&quot;&gt;Ether 9:19&lt;/ref&gt; [[wheat]], [[steel]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Nephi 4:9&lt;/ref&gt; [[brass]], [[chain]]s, [[iron]], [[scimitar]]s, and [[chariot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alma 18:9&lt;/ref&gt;
* The lack of widely accepted [[Linguistics and the Book of Mormon#Native American language-development|linguistic connections]] between any [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] and [[Middle East#Languages|Near Eastern languages]].
* The [[Genetics and the Book of Mormon|lack of DNA evidence]] linking any [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American group]] to the ancient [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;The traditional view of the Book of Mormon suggests that Native Americans are principally the descendants of an Israelite migration around 600 BC. However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up. For example:&lt;br /&gt;Simon G. Southerton. 2004. ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church''. Signature Books.&lt;br /&gt;The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon.&quot; ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents. Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent. Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes... The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated. However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'&quot; (pg 191)&lt;br /&gt;Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.&lt;ref name = historicallyaccurate&gt;&quot;The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong. For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve. They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith&quot;, [[Simon G. Southerton]] (2004, Signature Books), ''Losing a Lost Tribe'', pp. 164-165.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction. For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question. [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church&quot;, Southerton (2004), pg. 201.&lt;br&gt;Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as &quot;children of Lehi&quot; (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).&lt;br&gt;&quot;Latter-Day Saints believe their scripture to be history, written by ancient prophets&quot;, Grant Hardy (2009, Yale University Press), &quot;Introduction,&quot; ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'', ed. Royal Skousen, pg. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several [[Mormon apologetics|apologetic]] groups that disagree with the skeptics and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by [[FARMS|Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), and [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the [[limited geography model]], which states that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either [[Mesoamerica]], [[South America]], or the [[Great Lakes]] area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2000/01/mounting-evidence-for-the-book-of-mormon |title= Mounting Evidence for the Book of Mormon |first= Daniel C. |last= Peterson |authorlink= Daniel C.

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Book of Mormon printer's manuscript, 1870s.jpg|thumb|Book of Mormon printer's manuscript, shown with a 19th-century owner, George Schweich (grandson of early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] figure [[David Whitmer]])]]
The Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several [[scribe]]s over a period of 13 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=Dennis L. Largey, general|title=Book of Mormon reference companion|date=2003|publisher=Deseret Book|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=978-1573452311}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in three [[manuscript]]s.

The 116 lost pages contained the first portion of the [[Book of Lehi]]; it was lost after Smith loaned the original, uncopied manuscript to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;/&gt;

The first completed manuscript, called the original manuscript, was completed using a variety of scribes. Portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Nauvoo House]], and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold. Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=EoM-BoM-Manuscripts&gt;{{citation |last= Skousen |first= Royal Skousen |authorlink= Royal Skousen |url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5544 |title=  Encyclopedia of Mormonism |pages= 185–186 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

Only 28 percent of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991. The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

The second completed manuscript, called the '''printer's manuscript''', was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Royal | last = Skousen | title = Changes in the Book of Mormon | url = http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/2002_Changes_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.html | publisher = FAIR | location = 2002 FAIR Conference | format = Transcription of live presentation | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this point that initial [[copyediting]] of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text.&lt;ref name=EoM-BoM-Manuscripts/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LindsayFAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_changes.shtml#printed |title=LDS FAQ: Changes in the Book of Mormon |publisher=JeffLindsay.com |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death in 1850, Cowdery gave the printer's manuscript to [[David Whitmer]], another of the [[Three Witnesses]]. In 1903, the manuscript was bought from Whitmer's grandson by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, now known as the Community of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865633926/Recounting-the-preservation-of-the-printers-manuscript-of-the-Book-of-Mormon.html|title=Recounting the preservation of the printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon|last=Toone|first=Trent|date=2015-08-06|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2017-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2017, the LDS Church purchased the manuscript from the Community of Christ at a reported price of $35 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Church Acquires Printer's Manuscript of Book of Mormon|url = https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-acquires-printers-manuscript-book-of-mormon|website = Mormon Newsroom|access-date = 2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walch|first1=Tad|title=LDS Church buys printer's manuscript of Book of Mormon for record $35 million|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865689273/LDS-Church-buys-printers-manuscript-of-Book-of-Mormon-for-record-35-million-from-Community-of.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=Deseret (Salt Lake City) News|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printer's manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100 percent extant.&lt;ref&gt;There are three lines missing from the printer's manuscript in its current condition, covering 1 Nephi 1:7–8, 20. http://mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=15&amp;num=1&amp;id=401&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was imaged in 1923 and was recently made available for viewing online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Printer's Manuscript of the Book of Mormon, 1923 Photostatic Copies|url = http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/printers-manuscript-of-the-book-of-mormon-1923-photostatic-copies#!/paperSummary/printers-manuscript-of-the-book-of-mormon-1923-photostatic-copies&amp;p=6|website = josephsmithpapers.org|access-date = 2016-01-13|pages = 0–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LindsayFAQ&quot;/&gt; The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

The printer's manuscript was not used fully in the [[typesetting]] of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. The original manuscript was used by Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

===Ownership history: Book of Mormon printer's manuscript===
In the late 19th century the extant portion of the printer's manuscript remained with the family of [[David Whitmer]], who had been a principal founder of the [[Latter Day Saints]] and who, by the 1870s, led the [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)]]. During the 1870s, according to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', the LDS Church unsuccessfully attempted to buy it from Whitmer for a record price. LDS president [[Joseph F. Smith]] refuted this assertion in a 1901 letter, believing such a manuscript &quot;possesses no value whatever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/preserving-history-latter-day-saints/3-history-all-important-things-dc-693-john-whitmers |title=3. &quot;A History of All the Important Things&quot; (D&amp;C 69:3): John Whitmer's Record of Church History &amp;#124; Religious Studies Center |publisher=Rsc.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, David Whitmer's grandson George Schweich inherited the manuscript. By 1903 Schweich had mortgaged the manuscript for $1,800 and, needing to raise at least that sum, sold a collection including 72-percent of the Book of the original printer's manuscript (John Whitmer’s manuscript history, parts of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, manuscript copies of several revelations, and a piece of paper containing copied Book of Mormon characters) to the RLDS church (now the Community of Christ) for $2,450, with $2,300 of this amount for the printer's manuscript. The LDS Church had not sought to purchase the manuscript.

In 2015 this remaining portion was published by the [[Church Historian's Press]] in its ''[[Joseph Smith Papers]]'' series, in Volume Three of &quot;Revelations and Translations&quot;; and, in 2017, the LDS Church bought the printer's manuscript for {{currency|35000000|USD}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montgomeryrmontgomery |first=Rick |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/community/article174718321.html |title=Book of Mormon manuscript may be world's most expensive book &amp;#124; The Kansas City Star |publisher=Kansascity.com |date=2017-09-21 |accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mims |first=Bob |url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/09/22/historian-at-35m-original-printers-manuscript-of-book-of-mormon-a-bargain/ |title=Historian: At $35M, original printer's manuscript of Book of Mormon a bargain - The Salt Lake Tribune |publisher=Sltrib.com |date=2017-09-21 |accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

=== Chapter and verse notation systems ===
The original 1830 publication did not have verse markers, although the individual books were divided into relatively long chapters. Just as the Bible's present chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapter and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are conventions, not part of the original text.

Publishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Zarahemla Research Foundation publishes a 48-page booklet titled &quot;Book of Mormon Chapter &amp; Verse: RLDS–LDS Conversion Table&quot; to enable readers of an LDS edition to find references from an RLDS edition and vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RLDS 1908 edition, RLDS 1966 edition, the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] edition, and Restored Covenant editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.

===Textual criticism===

Although some earlier unpublished studies had been prepared, not until the early 1970s was true textual criticism applied to the Book of Mormon.  At that time BYU Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the LDS Church to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures.  One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text.  To that latter end, Stanley R. Larson (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about applying modern text critical standards to the manuscripts and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project—which he completed in 1974.  To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by [[Joseph Smith]] to his scribes) and the Printer's Manuscript (the copy [[Oliver Cowdery]] prepared for the Printer in 1829–1830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley R. Larson, “A Study of Some Textual Variations in the Book of Mormon, Comparing the Original and Printer's MSS., and Comparing the 1830, 1837, and 1840 Editions,” unpublished master's thesis (Provo: BYU, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Larson proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Larson, “Early Book of Mormon Texts: Textual Changes to the Book of Mormon in 1837 and 1840,” ''Sunstone'', 1/4 (Fall 1976), 44–55; Larson, “Textual Variants in the Book of Mormon Manuscripts,” ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', 10/4 (Autumn 1977), 8–30 [FARMS Reprint LAR-77]; Larson,  “Conjectural Emendation and the Text of the Book of Mormon,” ''BYU Studies'', 18 (Summer 1978), 563–569 [FARMS Reprint LAR-78].&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.

By 1979, with the establishment of the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] ([[FARMS]]) as a California non-profit research institution, an effort led by Robert F. Smith began to take full account of Larson's work and to publish a Critical Text of the Book of Mormon.  Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984.  The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work,&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Smith, ed., ''Book of Mormon Critical Text'', 2nd ed., 3 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 1986–1987).&lt;/ref&gt; greatly aided through the advice and assistance of a team that included Yale doctoral candidate [[Grant Hardy]], Dr. Gordon C. Thomasson, Professor [[John W. Welch]] (the head of FARMS), Professor [[Royal Skousen]].  However, these were merely preliminary steps to a far more exacting and all-encompassing project.

In 1988, with that preliminary phase of the project completed, Professor Skousen took over as editor and head of the FARMS Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.  He also closely examined the Printer's Manuscript (then owned by [[Community of Christ]]—RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made.  He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.

Thus far, Professor Skousen has published complete transcripts of the Original and Printer's Manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;''The Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'' (Provo: FARMS, 2001); ''The Printer's Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'', 2 vols. (FARMS, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a six-volume analysis of textual variants.&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon'', 6 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 2004–2009) -- now superseded by a second ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still in preparation are a history of the text, and a complete electronic collation of editions and manuscripts (volumes 3 and 5 of the Project, respectively).  Yale University has in the meantime published an edition of the Book of Mormon which incorporates all aspects of Skousen's research.&lt;ref&gt;Skousen, ed., ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'' (Yale Univ. Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; with Mormon scholars viewing the changes as superficial, done to clarify the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book of Mormon textual changes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Textual_changes|title=Book of Mormon textual changes|last=|first=|date=|website=Fairmormon|publisher=Fairmormon|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-English translations ===

{{See also|List of Book of Mormon translations}}
The LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS Church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99 percent of [[Latter-day Saints]] and 87 percent of the world's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2001/07/taking-the-scriptures-to-the-world |title= Taking the Scriptures to the World |journal= Ensign |date=July 2001 |page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]], [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]]) are available on audio cassette.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060308090404/http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?catalogId=10151&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1 Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Translations into [[American Sign Language]] are available on videocassette and DVD.

Typically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed several times before it is approved and published.&lt;ref name=NewsOfTheChurch&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/02/news-of-the-church|title= News of the Church: First Presidency Emphasizes Following Christ's Example |journal= Ensign |date=February 2005 |pages= 75–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.&lt;ref name=NewsOfTheChurch/&gt;

== Literary criticism ==
{{Missing information|further criticism (positive or negative)|date=July 2018}}
The Book of Mormon has occasionally been analyzed in a non-religious context for its literary merits.
{{quote|The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James's translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel -- half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast. Whenever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as &quot;exceeding sore,&quot; &quot;and it came to pass,&quot; etc., and made things satisfactory again. &quot;And it came to pass&quot; was his pet. If he had left that out, his Bible would have been only a pamphlet.|sign=[[Mark Twain]]|source=''[[Roughing It]]'', Chapter XVI}}
{{quote|Non-Mormons attempting psychiatric analyses [Of Joseph Smith] have been content to pin a label upon the youth and have ignored his greatest creative achievement because they found it dull. Dull it is, in truth, but not formless, aimless, or absurd. Its structure shows elaborate design, its narrative is spun coherently, and it demonstrates throughout a unity of purpose.  Its matter is drawn directly from the American frontier, from the impassioned revivalist sermons, the popular fallacies about Indian origin, and the current political crusades.

[[Terryl Givens]] wrote,
{{quote|Searching for literary wonders in the Book of Mormon is a bit like seeking lyrical inspiration in the books of Chronicles or Judges.  The Book of Mormon is a work of substantial complexity, however, with numerous well-spun narratives subsumed with a larger comprehensive vision  There is a neat symmetry to the bible as we have received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofmormonvery0000give/page/60|title=The Book of Mormon: A Very Short Introduction|last=Givens|first=Terryl|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780195369311|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofmormonvery0000give/page/60 60–61]|oclc=301705600}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Givens later concluded,
{{quote|The Book of Mormon remains a potent and disruptive force in the twenty-first century, challenging analysis with its authoritative claims. The Book remains an important cultural document of the nineteenth century and its literary merits are beginning to encourage further enquiry. The growth of Mormonism worldwide is also challenging older questions of wider appeal and accessibility of the Book of Mormon. The themes of the dislocation and decentring are coming to greater relevance in a globalised world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofmormonvery0000give/page/60|title=The Book of Mormon: A Very Short Introduction|last=Givens|first=Terryl|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780195369311|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofmormonvery0000give/page/60 60–61]|oclc=301705600}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Grant Hardy]] wrote,
{{quote|The Book of Mormon began as 588 densely printed pages in 1830, and the current official edition (reformatted with substantial grammatical editing) still runs to 531 pages.  In some ways this is surprising.  If the primary purpose of the Book of Mormon were to function as a sign—as tangible evidence that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God—that mission could have been accomplished much more concisely. A fifty page book delivered by an angel is no less miraculous than a thick volume; it's the heavenly messenger part that makes it hard to believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436310425|title=Understanding the Book of Mormon : a reader's guide|last=Hardy|first=Grant|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199731701|location=Oxford|pages=5|oclc=436310425}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|True or not, the Book of Mormon is a powerful epic written on a grand scale with a host of characters, a narrative of human struggle and conflict, of divine intervention, heroic good and atrocious evil, of prophecy, morality, and law. Its narrative structure is complex. The idiom is that of the King James Version, which most Americans assumed to be appropriate for divine revelation.... The Book of Mormon should rank among the great achievements of American literature, but it has never been accorded the status it deserves, since Mormons deny Joseph Smith's authorship, and non-Mormons, dismissing the work as a fraud, have been more likely to riducule than to read it.|sign=[[Daniel Walker Howe]]|source=''[[What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848]]'', Pg. 314}}
