'''Andersonville''' is a city in [[Sumter County, Georgia|Sumter County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 255.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_GCTP2.ST13&amp;prodType=table |title=Age Groups and Sex: 2010 - Alabamba; 2010 Census Summary File 1 |work=American Fact Finder |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Commerce]], [[United States Census Bureau]] |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the southwest part of the state, approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] on the [[Central of Georgia]] railroad. During the [[American Civil War]], it was the site of a [[prisoner-of-war camp]], which is now [[Andersonville National Historic Site]].

Andersonville is part of the [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]] [[Americus micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

== History ==
The hamlet of Anderson was named for John Anderson, a director of the South Western Railroad in 1853 when it was extended from Oglethorpe to Americus.  It was known as Anderson Station until the US post office was established in November 1855. The government changed the name of the station from “Anderson” to “Andersonville” in order to avoid confusion with the post office in [[Anderson, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/a.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=5 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War, the Confederate army established Camp Sumter at Andersonville to house incoming [[Union Army|Union]] [[prisoners of war]]. The overcrowded [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville Prison]] was notorious for its bad conditions, and nearly 13,000 prisoners died there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thoughtco.com/andersonville-prison-2360903 | title = American Civil War: Andersonville Prison  | last = Hickman | first = Kennedy | date = May 16, 2016 | website = ThoughtCo.com | access-date = 2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town also served as a supply depot during the war period. It included a post office, a depot, a blacksmith shop and stable, a couple of general stores, two saloons, a school, a Methodist church, and about a dozen houses. (Ben Dykes, who owned the land on which the prison was built, was both depot agent and postmaster.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/11andersonville/11facts1.htm |title=Reading 1: Andersonville Prison |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the establishment of the prison, the area was entirely dependent on agriculture, supported by dark reddish brown sandy loams later mapped as Greenville and Red Bay soil series. After the close of the prison and end of the war, the town continued economically dependent on agriculture, primarily the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop.

It was not until 1968, when the large-scale mining of [[kaolin]], bauxitic kaolin, and [[bauxite]] was begun by Mulcoa, Mullite Company of America, that the town was dramatically altered. This operation exploited {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of scrub oak wilderness into a massive mining and refining operation. The company now ships more than 2000 tons of refined ore from Andersonville each week.

In 1974, long-time mayor Lewis Easterlin and a group of concerned citizens decided to promote tourism in the town, redeveloping Main Street to look much as it did during the American Civil War. The city of Andersonville and the [[Andersonville National Historic Site]], location of the prison camp, are now tourist attractions.
