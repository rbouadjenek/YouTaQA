In human [[social behavior]], '''discrimination''' is prejudiced treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction towards, a being based on the group, class, or category to which they are perceived to belong. These include [[ageism|age]], [[caste]], [[Employment discrimination against persons with criminal records|criminal record]], [[heightism|height]], [[ableism|disability]], [[family|family status]], [[gender identity]], [[gender expression]], [[generation]], [[Genetics|genetic characteristics]], [[marital|marital status]], [[Nationalism|nationality]], [[colorism|color]], [[Racism|race]] and [[racism|ethnicity]], [[Religious discrimination|religion]], [[sexism|sex]] and [[sex characteristics]], [[Sexual orientation discrimination|sexual orientation]], [[Classism|social class]], [[Speciesism|species]], as well as other categories. Discrimination consists of treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, &quot;in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=discrimination, definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/discrimination |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the [[social exclusion|exclusion]] of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]].

==Etymology==
The term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term &quot;discrimination&quot; generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to sociology |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc. |year=2009 |edition=7th |location=New York |page=324 |medium=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;discrimination&quot; derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means &quot;to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction&quot;.

==Definitions==
Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way despite the fact that the people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lippert-Rasmussen |first=Kasper |year=2006 |title=Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account |journal=San Diego Law Review |volume=43 |pages=817–856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1755-2567.2010.01080.x|title = Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion| journal=Theoria| volume=76| issue=4| pages=314–332|year = 2010|last1 = Horta|first1 = Oscar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nVIJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=equality|title=Anti-Discriminatory Practice: Equality, Diversity and Social Justice|last=Thompson|first=Neil|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-58666-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# ''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# ''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy{{clarify|date=February 2012}} and reflects stable and legitimate inter group status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the statement:  &quot;Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |title=United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601211521/http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |archivedate=2014-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International bodies [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

==Types==

===Age===
{{Main|Ageism|Adultism}}
[[Ageism]] or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Ageism|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person's age.&lt;ref name=&quot;KirkpatrickKatsiaficas1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=George R.|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George N.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Robert George|author4=Mary Lou Emery|title=Introduction to critical sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdf2QupEaHgC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1987|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8290-1595-9|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is most often directed towards old people, or adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, &quot;Thirty Years of Ageism Research&quot;. In Nelson T (ed). ''Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php &quot;Young and Oppressed&quot;]. youthrights.org. Retrieved on 11 April 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105250/http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States.  Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414230847/https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at [[Ghent University]], measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In [[Belgium]], they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M. (In press) [http://users.ugent.be/~sbaert/BaertNorgaThuyVanHecke_GettingGreyHairs_JEP.pdf Getting Grey Hairs in the Labour Market: An Alternative Experiment on Age Discrimination] Journal of Economic Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey for the [[University of Kent]], England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination.  This is a higher proportion than for [[Sexism|gender]] or [[Racism|racial]] discrimination. [[Dominic Abrams]], social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf How Ageist is Britain?] London: Age Concern. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027165812/http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf |date=October 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste===
{{See also|Caste}}

According to [[UNICEF]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], [[caste]] discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;unicef 1&quot;&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/29/global1815.htm|title=Global Caste Discrimination|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=26 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115074446/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/29/global1815.htm|archive-date=15 November 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811033342/http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm|url-status=dead|title=Caste – The Facts|archivedate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based on caste, as perceived by [[UNICEF]], is mainly prevalent in parts of [[Asia]], ([[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Japan]]), [[Africa]] and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;unicef 1&quot;/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there were 200 million [[Dalit]]s or [[Scheduled Castes]] (formerly known as &quot;untouchables&quot;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsn.org/news-resources/idsn-news/read/article/india-official-dalit-population-exceeds-200-million/128/|title=India: Official Dalit population exceeds 200 million|date=29 May 2013|publisher=International Dalit Solidarity Network|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture or subculture===
{{Expand section|date=November 2019}}

Discrimination can be directed towards persons based on their [[culture]]s or [[subculture]]s. In 2013, the [[Greater Manchester Police]] in the United Kingdom began to classify attacks on subcultures such as [[Goth subculture|goths]], [[emo]]s, [[Punk subculture|punks]] and [[Heavy metal subculture|metallers]] as [[hate crime]]s, in the same way it records abuses against people because of their religion, race, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 4 April 2013 |title= Attacks on goths, punks and emos are ‘hate crimes’ |url= https://www.channel4.com/news/goth-hate-crime-emo-punk-metal-police-gmp |work= Channel 4 News |access-date= 4 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision followed the [[murder of Sophie Lancaster]] and beating of her boyfriend in 2007, who were attacked because they were goths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Sedgwick |first= Mark |date= 4 April 2013 |title= How are goths and emos defined? |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22026044 |work= BBC News |access-date= 4 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with [[Disability|disabilities]] in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of 'normal living', results in public and private places and services, educational settings, and social services that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown that disabled people not only need employment in order to be provided with the opportunity to earn a living but they also need employment in order to sustain their mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vornholt|first=Katharina|author2=Sjir Uitdewilligen |author3=Frans J.N. Nijhuis |title=Factors Affecting the Acceptance of People with Disabilities at Work: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation|date=December 2013|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–75|doi=10.1007/s10926-013-9426-0|pmid=23400588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce his or her isolation.

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Language===
{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists in [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs in [[French language|French]].]]
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Notable examples are the [[Anti-French sentiment in the United States]] as well as the [[Anti-Quebec sentiment]] in Canada targeting people who speak the French language. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who either do or do not speak a particular language or languages. An example of this is when thousands of Wayúu Native Colombians were given derisive names and the same birth date, by government officials, during a campaign to provide them with identification cards. The issue was not discovered until many years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/colombian-wayuu-people-given-mocking-names|title=Colombian clans who speak no Spanish mocked with joke names on ID cards|first=Sibylla|last=Brodzinsky|date=October 3, 2011|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noteworthy example of linguistic discrimination is the backdrop to the [[Bengali language movement|Bengali Language Movement]] in erstwhile [[Pakistan]], a political campaign that played a key role in the creation of [[Bangladesh]]. In 1948, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] declared [[Urdu]] as the national language of [[Pakistan]] and branded those supporting the use of [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the most widely spoken language in the state, as enemies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[1971 Bangladesh genocide#CITEREFHossainTollefson2006|Hossain &amp; Tollefson 2006]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''.{{by whom|date=January 2012}} Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or &quot;official&quot; language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Discrimination based on a person's name may also occur, with researchers suggesting that this form of discrimination is present based on a name's meaning, its pronunciation, its uniqueness, its gender affiliation, and its racial affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Silberzhan | first1 =Raphael | title =It Pays to be Herr Kaiser | journal =Psychological Science | volume =24 | issue =12 | pages =2437–2444 | date =May 19, 2013 | doi =10.1177/0956797613494851 | pmid =24113624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Laham | first =Simon | title =The name-pronunciation effect: Why people like Mr. Smith more than Mr. Colquhoun | journal =Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume=48 | issue =2012 | pages =752–756 | date =December 9, 2011 | doi =10.1016/j.jesp.2011.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cotton | first =John  | title =The &quot;name game&quot;: affective and hiring reactions to first names | journal =Journal of Managerial Psychology | volume =23 | issue =1 | pages =18–39 | date =July 2007 | doi =10.1108/02683940810849648  | url =https://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=mgmt_fac }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bertrand | first =Marianne | title =Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamaal? | journal =The American Economic Review | volume =94 | issue =4 | pages =991–1013 |  date =September 2004 | doi =10.1257/0002828042002561 | url =http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00216.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Easton | first=Stephen | title=Blind recruiting study suggests positive discrimination common in the APS | newspaper=The Mandarin | date=June 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each résumé before making their initial &quot;fit/no fit&quot; screen-out decision and that a person's name is one of the six things they focus on most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first =Jacquelyn | title =Here's What Recruiters Look At In The 6 Seconds They Spend On Your Résumé | newspaper =Business Insider | date =November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  France has made it illegal to view a person's name on a résumé when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates.

===Nationality===
Discrimination on the basis of [[nationality]] is usually included in [[Employment discrimination|employment laws]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm Race, Color, National Origin and Ancestry], State of Wisconsin {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024061935/http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see above [[Discrimination#Employment|section for employment discrimination]] specifically).

It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a &quot;level of acceptance&quot; in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Schwieren, [http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/39/6/643.abstract Mechanisms Underlying Nationality-Based Discrimination in Teams.

===Region===
{{see also|Regional discrimination in China}}
Regional or geographic discrimination is a form of discrimination that is based on the region in which a person lives or the region in which a person was born. It differs from national discrimination because it may not be based on national borders or the country in which the victim lives, instead, it is based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese people who were born in regions of the countryside that are far away from cities that are located within China, and discrimination against [[Americans]] who are from the [[Southern United States|southern]] or [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination that is based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Accent&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/accent-discrimination/ | title=Accent Discrimination Law and Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently because of what they do or do not believe in or because of their feelings towards a given [[religion]]. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the [[Balkans]], known as the &quot;rayah&quot; or the &quot;protected flock&quot;, was subjected to discrimination under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|Was this &quot;discrimination&quot; only expressed by the meaning of a single word? If so, this can hardly be an illustrative example of religious discrimination and should be replaced with a better example.|date=November 2015}}

Restrictions on the types of occupations that [[Jews|Jewish]] people could hold were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles that were considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations that were only tolerated as a &quot;[[necessary evil]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]&quot;.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] which are guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States as secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied &quot;equal protection under the law, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination.

Though gender discrimination and sexism refer to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender. [[Image:OECD gender wage gap.svg|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[OECD]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|title=OECD Employment Outlook 2008 – Statistical Annex OECD, Paris|year=2008|page=358|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206221033/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|archivedate= December 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Glott, R., Schmidt, P., &amp; Ghosh, R. A.|date=March 2010|title=Wikipedia survey—Overview of results|work=UNI-MERIT| url=http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|archivedate=April 14, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for [[systemic bias]]. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reagle, J., &amp; Rhue, L.|year=2011|title=Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Britannica|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|pages=1138–1158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, F.|year=2003|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|edition=2nd|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-0900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/sex-discrimination|title=Sex Discrimination|website=Citation.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = J.

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a &quot;[[glass ceiling]]&quot; and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''Glass Ceilings and Open Doors,'' Fordham Law Review,  64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, ''The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;glass ceiling&quot; is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin ''Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,'' Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: &quot;Over half of all Master's degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white.&quot; In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glass Ceiling Commission&quot;&gt;{{cite web

They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/QS-womenwork2010.htm Quick Stats on Women Workers, 2010]&quot;. [[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Employment and Earnings, 2010 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, women are found to experience a [[sticky floor]]. While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution. It might be explained by both employer discrimination and gender differences in career aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N. (Forthcoming) [Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors?] Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transgender]] individuals, whether [[Male-to-female|trans women]], [[Trans man|trans men]], or [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]], often experience [[transphobia|transphobic]] problems that often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them.

Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as &quot;women's jobs&quot;. One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;''Noack v YMCA of Greater Houston Area'', 132, S. Ct.425 (US, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and black people in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment.

Discrimination in slasher films is relevant. Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive, thus reinforcing the idea that female sexuality can be costly.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|author2=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One's sexual orientation is a &quot;predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation &quot;Sexual Orientation&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexuality; a term for such hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against [[asexuality|asexual people]] than to homosexual or bisexual people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward &quot;Group X&quot;: Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

In the US, a government policy which is known as [[affirmative action]] was instituted in order to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as [[African Americans]] and women, who have been subject to discrimination for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography on Race, Gender and Affirmative Action|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/biblio.htm |work=Race, Gender, and Affirmative Action|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as reverse discrimination. In particular, minority quota systems such as [[affirmative action]]) may discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group or members of other minority groups. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, &quot;There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214072218/http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html|url-status=dead|title=American Civil Rights Institute &amp;#124; Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archivedate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary phenomenon===
There are instances in which groups, victims of racialistic practices, have themselves applied doctrines with racist implications in their struggle for freedom. Such an attitude is a secondary phenomenon, a reaction stemming from one's search for an identity which prior racist theory and racialistic practices denied them. The new forms of racist ideology, resulting from this prior exploitation, are a product of a political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000122962 |title=Four statements on the race question |format=PDF |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |date=1969 |id=Document code: COM.69/II.27/A |page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social theories]] such as [[egalitarianism]] assert that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991023101723/http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 1999 |title=Civil rights |accessdate= March 20, 2019 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, &quot;abolitionist&quot; or &quot;vegan&quot; egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is &quot;[[speciesist]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;singerethics-sentience&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Ethics |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-43971-8 |edition=Second |pages=[https://archive.org/details/practicalethics00sing_0/page/57 57–58] |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. ...

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a &quot;natural&quot; social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} The [[Nazis]] in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=Heribert|title=Anti-Semitism and Anti-Black Racism: Nazi Germany and Apartheid South Africa|journal=Telos|date=1 July 1996|volume=1996|issue=108|pages=25–46|doi=10.3817/0696108025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game theory===
Economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] (2013) argues that &quot;discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory&quot;, and that neither classical [[game theory]] nor [[neoclassical economics]] can explain this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 11: Evolving domination in the laboratory

|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap (2002) ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround [[hawk-dove game]] (HD game). At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue. At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent. Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the &quot;advantaged&quot; color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive &quot;hawk&quot; strategy against players of the other, &quot;disadvantaged&quot; color, who played the acquiescent &quot;dove&quot; strategy against the advantaged color. Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.

The experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not. They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group. Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a &quot;fairness&quot; equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]

==State vs. free market==

It is debated as to whether or not [[market (economics)|markets]] discourage discrimination brought about by the state. One argument is that since discrimination restricts access to customers and incurs additional expense, market logic will punish discrimination. Opposition by companies to &quot;Jim Crow&quot; segregation laws is an example of this.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, &quot;The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars.&quot; Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative argument is that markets don't necessarily undermine discrimination, as it is argued that if discrimination is profitable by catering to the &quot;[[Taste-based discrimination|tastes]]&quot; of individuals (which is the point of the market), then the market will not punish discrimination. It is argued that micro economic analysis of discrimination uses unusual methods to determine its effects (using explicit treatment of production functions) and that the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) in the long run contradicts claims that the market will function well and punish discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Toikka, The Welfare Implications of Becker’s Discrimination Coefficient, 13 J. Econ. Theory 472, 472 (1976);  Glen G. Cain, &quot;The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey&quot;, in ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Richard Layard eds., 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For review of the literature in regard to the last two points see [http://www.glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf Menahem Pasternak, Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications, 33 N. C. Cent. L. Rev. (2011) 163]&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, economic actors may have imperfect information and [[Statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimination]] may occur rationally and without prejudice.
