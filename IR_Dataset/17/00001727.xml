'''Amphipolis''' ({{lang-ell|Αμφίπολη|translit=Amfipoli}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀμφίπολις|translit=Amphipolis}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1191935&amp;fid=2168&amp;c=greece |title=Amfípolis: Greece, name, administrative division, geographic coordinates and map |format= |work=Geographical Names |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a municipality in the [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres regional unit]] of [[Greece]]. The seat of the municipality is [[Rodolivos]].&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{in lang|el}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was  an ancient Greek [[Polis|polis (city)]], and later a Roman city, whose large remains can still be seen.

Amphipolis, an [[Colonies in antiquity|Athenian colony]], was the seat of the [[Battle of Amphipolis|battle]] between the [[Spartans]] and [[Athenians]] in 422&amp;nbsp;BC, and also the place where [[Alexander the Great]] prepared for campaigns leading to his invasion of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Amphipolis&quot;, Ministry of Culture: {{ISBN|960-214-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's three finest admirals, [[Nearchus]], [[Androsthenes of Thasos|Androsthenes]] and [[Laomedon of Mytilene|Laomedon]], resided in Amphipolis, which is also the place where, after Alexander's death, his wife [[Roxana]] and their small son [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander IV]] were exiled and later murdered.

Excavations in and around the city have revealed important buildings, ancient walls and tombs. The finds are displayed at the [[Amphipolis Archaeological Museum|archaeological museum of Amphipolis]]. At the nearby vast [[Kasta Tomb|Kasta burial mound]], an ancient Macedonian tomb has recently been revealed. The [[Lion of Amphipolis]] monument nearby is a popular destination for visitors.

It was located within the region of [[Edonis (region)|Edonis]].

==History==
===Origins===
Throughout the 5th century BC, [[Classical Athens|Athens]] sought to consolidate its control over [[Thrace]], which was strategically important because of its primary materials (the gold and silver of the [[Pangaion hills]] and the dense forests essential for naval construction), and the sea routes vital for Athens' supply of grain from [[Scythia]]. After a first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in 497&amp;nbsp;BC by the [[Miletus|Milesian]] [[Tyrant]] [[Histiaeus]], the Athenians founded a first colony at Ennea-Hodoi (‘Nine Ways’) in 465&amp;nbsp;BC, but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the [[Thracians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] I, 100, 3&lt;/ref&gt; A second attempt took place in 437&amp;nbsp;BC on the same site under the guidance of [[Hagnon, son of Nikias|Hagnon]], son of [[Nicias]], which was successful. The city and its first walls date from this time.

[[File:Kasta tumulus and Lion of Amphipolis location map en.jpg|thumb|Amphipolis location map]]

The new settlement took the name of Amphipolis (literally, &quot;around the city&quot;), a name which is the subject of much debate about its [[etymology]]. Thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the [[Strymon River]] flows &quot;around the city&quot; on two sides;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc%3DPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%26layout%3D%26loc%3D4.102.3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209111244/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |archivedate=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however a note in the ''[[Suda]]'' (also given in the lexicon of [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]) offers a different explanation apparently given by [[Marsyas]], son of [[Periander]]: that a large proportion of the population lived &quot;around the city&quot;. However, a more probable explanation is the one given by [[Julius Pollux]]: that the name indicates the vicinity of an [[isthmus]].

Amphipolis became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and, consequently, a target of choice for their [[Sparta]]n adversaries. The Athenian population remained very much in the minority in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc%3DPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Bquery%3Dchapter%3D%23471%3Blayout%3D%3Bloc%3D4.105.1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209111244/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |archivedate=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Amphipolis remained an independent city and an ally of the Athenians, rather than a colony or member of the Athens-led [[Delian League]]. However, in 424&amp;nbsp;BC the Spartan general [[Brasidas]] easily took control of the city.

A rescue expedition led by the Athenian general, and later historian, [[Thucydides]] had to settle for securing [[Eion]] and could not retake Amphipolis, a failure for which Thucydides was sentenced to exile. A new Athenian force under the command of [[Cleon]] failed once more in 422&amp;nbsp;BC during the [[Battle of Amphipolis]] at which both Cleon and Brasidas lost their lives. Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp. From then on he was regarded as the founder of the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc%3DPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Bquery%3Dchapter%3D%23511%3Blayout%3D%3Bloc%3D5.10.1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209111244/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |archivedate=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koukouli-Chrysanthaki Ch., &quot;Excavating Classical Amphipoli&quot;, In (eds) Stamatopoulou M., and M., Yeroulanou &lt;Excavating Classical Culture&gt;, BAR International Series 1031, 2002:57-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agelarakis A., “Physical anthropological report on the cremated human remains of an individual retrieved from the Amphipolis agora”, In “Excvating Classical Amphipolis” by Koukouli-Chrysantkai Ch., &lt;Excavating Classical Culture&gt; (eds.)

and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices.

===Macedonian rule===
[[File:Amphipolis fortifications.jpg|thumb|[[Fortification]]s and bridge of Amphipolis.]]
[[File:Lion of Amphipolis BW 2017-10-05 09-38-25.jpg|thumb|The &quot;[[Lion of Amphipolis]]&quot;.]]

The city itself kept its independence until the reign of king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] ({{reign|359|336 BC}}) despite several Athenian attacks, notably because of the government of [[Callistratus of Aphidnae]]. In 357&amp;nbsp;BC, Philip succeeded where the Athenians had failed and conquered the city, thereby removing the obstacle which Amphipolis presented to Macedonian control over Thrace. According to the historian [[Theopompus]], this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between Athens and Philip II, who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], but the Macedonian king betrayed the accord, refusing to cede Amphipolis and laying siege to Pydna as well.&lt;ref&gt;Theopompus, Philippica&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was not immediately incorporated into the Macedonian kingdom, and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy. The border of Macedonia was not moved further east; however, Philip sent a number of Macedonian governors to Amphipolis, and in many respects the city was effectively &quot;Macedonianized&quot;. Nomenclature, the calendar and the currency (the [[Stater|gold stater]], created by Philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the Pangaion hills, replaced the Amphipolitan [[drachma]]) were all replaced by Macedonian equivalents. In the reign of [[Alexander the Great]], Amphipolis was an important naval base, and the birthplace of three of the most famous Macedonian admirals: [[Nearchus]], Androsthenes&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=Androsthenes+Thasos&amp;btnG=Search+Books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laomedon of Mytilene|Laomedon]], whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of Amphipolis.

The importance of the city in this period is shown by Alexander the Great's decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing 1,500 [[talent (coin)|talents]] were built. Alexander prepared for campaigns here against Thrace in 335&amp;nbsp;BC and his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of Asia. The port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in Asia. After Alexander's death, his wife [[Roxana]] and their young son Alexander&amp;nbsp;IV were exiled by [[Cassander]] and later murdered here.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History Book XIX, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Macedonian sovereignty Amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance, as shown by inscriptions. Amphipolis became one of the main stops on the Macedonian royal road (as testified by a border stone found between [[Philippi]] and Amphipolis giving the distance to the latter), and later on the ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', the principal [[Roman roads|Roman road]] which crossed the southern Balkans. Apart from the ramparts of the lower town, the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a set of well-preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible. Though little is known of the layout of the town, modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation, including a military ordinance of [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and an [[Ephebos|ephebarchic]] law from the gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_10.html Ephebarchic Law of Amphipolis] - English translation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest by the Romans===
After the final victory of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] over Macedonia in the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168&amp;nbsp;BC, Amphipolis became the capital of one of the four mini-republics, or ''merides'', which were created by the Romans out of the kingdom of the [[Antigonid Dynasty|Antigonids]] which [[Diadochi|succeeded]] Alexander's empire in Macedon. These ''merides'' were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state, and later province, of [[Thracia]]. According to the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', the apostles [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and [[Silas]] passed through Amphipolis in the early AD&amp;nbsp;50s, on their [[Missionary journeys of Paul|journey]] between [[Philippi]] and [[Thessalonica]]; where hence they proselytized to the Greeks, including {{wiktang|aporetic}} [[Epicurean]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|17:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival in Late Antiquity===
[[File:Plan and neighbourhood of Amphipolis.jpg|thumb|Plan and neighbourhood of Amphipolis.]]
During the period of [[Late Antiquity]], Amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of Macedonia, as is evidenced by the large number of [[Christianity|Christian churches]] that were built. Significantly however, these churches were built within a restricted area of the town, sheltered by the walls of the [[acropolis]]. This has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable, and that the population of the city had considerably diminished.

Nevertheless, the number, size and quality of the churches constructed between the 5th and 6th centuries are impressive. Four [[basilica]]s adorned with rich [[mosaic]] floors and elaborate architectural sculptures (such as the ram-headed [[column]] capitals – see picture) have been excavated, as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the [[Basilica of San Vitale|basilica]] of [[Saint Vitalis of Milan|St Vitalis]] in [[Ravenna]]. It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town. One possible explanation provided by the historian [[André Boulanger]] is that an increasing ‘willingness’ on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late Roman period to spend money on local [[gentrification]] projects (which he terms ''[[euergetism]]'', from the Greek verb {{lang|grc|εὐεργετέω}}; meaning 'I do good') was exploited by the local church to its advantage, which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city's territory. Amphipolis was also a [[diocese]] under the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Thessalonica]] – the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533. The bishopric is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 831&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decline of the city===
The [[South Slavs#Interaction with the Balkan population|Slavic invasions]] of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back-country Amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town, during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis. The ramparts were maintained to a certain extent, thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city, and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans. Around the middle of the 7th century, a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town, with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments. The acropolis, the [[Thermae|Roman baths]], and especially the episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall.

The city was probably abandoned in the eighth century, as the last bishop was attested at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787. Its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient Eion, port of Amphipolis, which had been rebuilt and refortified in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] under the name “[[Chrysopolis (Thrace)|Chrysopolis]]”. This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity, before being abandoned during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]]. The last recorded sign of activity in the region of Amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by the ''[[megas primikerios]]'' John and the ''[[stratopedarches]]'' Alexios to protect the land that they had given to the [[Pantokratoros monastery|monastery of Pantokrator]] on [[Mount Athos]].

==Archaeology==
[[File:Amphipolis frescoes.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] from a house (Hellenistic period).]]
[[File:Silver ossuary and gold crown of Brasidas.jpg|thumb|Silver ossuary and gold crown of [[Brasidas]]]]

The site was discovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during the 19th century, including E. Cousinéry (1831) (engraver), [[Leon Heuzey]] (1861), and P. Perdrizet (1894–1899). However, excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War. The [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Greek Archaeological Society]] under D. Lazaridis excavated in 1972 and 1985, uncovering a necropolis, the city wall (see photograph), the basilicas, and the acropolis. Further excavations have since uncovered the river bridge, the gymnasium, Greek and Roman villas and numerous tombs etc.

Parts of the lion monument and tombs were discovered during World War I by Bulgarian and British troops whilst digging trenches in the area. In 1934, M. Feyel, of the [[École française d'Athènes]] (EfA), led an [[epigraphy|epigraphical mission]] to the site and uncovered further remains of the lion monument (a reconstruction was given in the ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique'', a publication of the EfA which is available on line).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120604182322/http://cefael.efa.gr/detail.php?site_id=1&amp;actionID=page&amp;prevpos=0&amp;serie_id=BCH&amp;volume_number=59&amp;issue_number=0&amp;startpos=289 Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agelarakis, “Physical anthropological report on the cremated human remains of an individual retrieved from the Amphipolis agora” in “Excvating Classical Amphipolis” by Ch. Koukouli-Chrysantkai, &lt;Excavating Classical Culture&gt; (eds.) Stamatopoulou M., and M., Yeroulanou, BAR International Series 1031, 2002: 72-73&lt;/ref&gt; and a gold crown (see image) was found in a tomb in pride of place under the Agora.

===The Tomb of Amphipolis===
{{Main|Kasta Tomb}}
[[File:The Abduction of Persephone by Pluto, Amphipolis.jpg|thumb|An [[Ancient Greek art|ancient Greek]] [[mosaic]] depicting the abduction of [[Persephone]] by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Amphipolis, 4th century BC]]

In 2012&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11080463/Marble-female-figurines-unearthed-in-vast-Alexander-the-Great-era-Greek-tomb.html |title=Marble female figurines unearthed in vast Alexander the Great–era Greek tomb |author=Andrew Marszal |date=7 September 2014 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek archaeologists unearthed a large tomb within the [[Kasta Tomb|Kasta Hill]], the biggest burial mound in Greece, northeast of Amphipolis. The large size of the tumulus indicates the prominence of the burials made there. The perimeter wall of the tumulus is {{cvt|497|m|yd}} long, and is made of limestone covered with marble.

The tomb comprises three chambers separated by walls. There are two [[sphinxes]] just outside the entrance to the tomb. Two of the columns supporting the roof in the first section are in the form of [[Caryatid]]s, in the 4th century BC style. The excavation revealed a pebble mosaic showing the abduction of [[Persephone]] by [[Hades]] directly behind the Caryatids and in front of the Macedonian marble door leading to the &quot;third&quot; chamber. Hades' chariot is drawn by two white horses and led to the underworld by [[Hermes]]. The mosaic verifies the Macedonian character of the tomb. As the head of one of the sphinxes was found inside the tomb behind the broken door, it is clear that there were intruders, probably in antiquity.

The identity of the burial remains unknown and the excavation is continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28758920|title=Greek tomb at Amphipolis is 'important discovery'|date=12 August 2014|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Katerina Peristeri]], the archaeologist heading the excavation of the tomb, dates the tomb to the late 4th century BC, the period after the death of [[Alexander the Great]] (323&amp;nbsp;BC).

In November 2017, the Greek Minister of Culture, Lydia Koniordou, announced that the grave should be accessible to the public in about three years. The financing for the necessary construction project should amount to around €2.8&amp;nbsp;million. €1.5&amp;nbsp;million is to be spent by the [[Region of Central Macedonia]], €1.3&amp;nbsp;million is to be taken from the [[INTERREG Fund]] of the [[European Union]]. In the course of this measure, building materials of the grave site, which were later used by the Romans elsewhere, will be rebuilt in their original location. The work should begin in 2018 or 2019 and last for around one year.&lt;ref&gt;Griechenland Zeitung, Edition 605, November 29. 2017, page 7 (German language)&lt;/ref&gt;
