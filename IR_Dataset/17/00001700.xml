Ambros studied at the [[Charles University of Prague|University of Prague]]&lt;ref name=Blom /&gt; and was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an [[avocation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ambros, August Wilhelm|volume=1|page=798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1850 onwards he became well known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his ''History of Music'', which was published at intervals from 1862&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Henry Lang|Lang, Paul Henry]]. (1997) ''Music in Western Civilization'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company. p. 987. {{ISBN|0-393-04074-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by [[Otto Kade]] and [[Wilhelm Langhans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Ambros was professor of the history of music at [[Prague]] from 1869 to 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Meinong, Alexius &amp; [[Guido Adler|Adler, Guido]] (1995) ''Eine Freundschaft in Briefen Alexius'', Rodopi. p. 8. {{ISBN|90-5183-867-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Prague, he sat on the board of governors in the [[Prague Conservatory|Prague Royal Conservatory]]. By 1872, he was living in Vienna and was employed by the Department of Justice as an officer and by [[Prince Rudolf]]'s family as his tutor.
