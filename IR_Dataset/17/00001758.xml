'''André de Longjumeau''' (also known as '''Andrew of Longjumeau''' in English) was a 13th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionary and diplomat and one of the most active Occidental diplomats in the East in the 13th century. He led two embassies to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]: the first carried letters from [[Pope Innocent IV]] and the second bore gifts and letters from [[Louis IX of France]] to [[Güyük Khan]]. Well acquainted with the [[Middle-East]], he spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and &quot;[[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]&quot; (thought to be either [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Persian language|Persian]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;mxpvnk&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1985|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission for the holy Crown of Thorns==
[[Image:HolyCrown.JPG|thumb|Andrew went to Constantinople to obtain the [[Crown of Thorns]] bought by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] from [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]]. It is preserved today in a 19th-century reliquary, in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Paris]].]]
Andrew's first mission to the East was when he was asked by the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to go and fetch the [[Crown of Thorns]] which had been sold to him by the Latin Emperor of [[Constantinople]] [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]] in 1238, who was anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire.&lt;ref name = &quot;mxpvnk&quot;/&gt; Andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother Jacques.

==Papal mission to the Mongols (1245–1247)==
Andrew of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by [[Pope Innocent IV]]. He left [[Lyon]] in the spring of 1245 for the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory G. Guzman, &quot;Simon of Saint-Quentin and the Dominican Mission to the Mongol Baiju: A Reappraisal&quot; ''Speculum'', Vol. 46, No. 2. (April., 1971), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He visited Muslim principalities in [[Syria]] and representatives of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] churches in Persia, finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near [[Tabriz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Igor de Rachewiltz]], ''Papal Envoys to the Great Khans'' (Stanford University Press, 1971), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tabriz, André de Longjumeau met with a monk from the [[Far East]], named [[Simeon Rabban Ata]], who had been put in charge by the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of protecting the Christians in the [[Middle-East]].{{sfn|Richard|p=376}}

==Second mission to the Mongols (1249–1251)==
{{further information|Franco-Mongol alliance|Europeans in Medieval China|}}
At the Mongol camp near [[Kars]] Andrew had met a certain [[David and Mark|David]], who in December 1248 appeared at the court of King [[Louis IX of France]] in [[Cyprus]]. Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Eljigidei]], and a proposal of a joint attack upon the Islamic powers of [[Syria]]. In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to [[Güyük Khan]]; with Longjumeau went his brother Jacques (also a Dominican) and several others – John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert &quot;Le [[Sommelier]]&quot;, Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}}

The party set out on 16 February 1249, with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents including a chapel-tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], and certainly through [[Taraz|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}}

On arrival at the supreme Mongol court – either that on the [[Emil River|Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Alakol]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] – Andrew found Güyük Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Oghul Qaimish]] (the &quot;Camus&quot; of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for Louis IX. But it is certain that before the friar had left &quot;Tartary&quot;, [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]], Güyük's successor, had been elected.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|pp=972–973}}

Andrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] with [[Prester John]]; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the [[Mongols]]' homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]]. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Christianity among the Mongols|Mongol Christianity]] and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host) are based on fact.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}}

Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of &quot;Tartary&quot; (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead [[Genghis Khan|Khan]], gifts which were treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], &quot;''se repenti fort''&quot; (&quot;felt very sorry&quot;).{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}}

==Death==
The date and location of Andrew's death is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorcy1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorcy|first=Sr. Mary Jean|title=St. Dominic's Family: Over 300 Famous Dominicans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL-cCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=24 November 1990|publisher=TAN Books|isbn=9781505103465|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
