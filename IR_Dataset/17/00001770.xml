'''Apollo 13''' was the seventh crewed mission in the [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]] and the third meant to [[Moon landing|land on the Moon]]. The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].

Accidental ignition of damaged wire insulation inside the oxygen tank as it was being routinely stirred caused an explosion that vented the tank's contents. Without oxygen, needed both for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.

Although the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] by television.

An investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&amp;nbsp;13]]''.

== Background ==
In 1961, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] challenged his nation to land an astronaut on [[the Moon]] by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth.&lt;ref name = &quot;mission overview&quot; /&gt; [[NASA]] worked towards this goal incrementally, sending astronauts into space during [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]], leading up to the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury and Gemini|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/space-race/online/sec300/sec340.htm|accessdate=February 11, 2019|publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]]|work=The Space Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was achieved with [[Apollo 11]], which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] walked on the lunar surface while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] orbited the Moon in [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']]. The mission returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, fulfilling Kennedy's challenge.&lt;ref name = &quot;mission overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 11 Mission Overview|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2019|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA had contracted for fifteen [[Saturn&amp;nbsp;V]] rockets to achieve the goal; at the time no one knew how many missions this would require.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=232–233}} Since success was obtained in 1969 with the sixth Saturn{{nbsp}}V on Apollo&amp;nbsp;11, nine rockets remained available for a hoped-for [[Canceled Apollo missions#Follow-on lunar missions|total of ten landings]]. After the excitement of Apollo 11, the general public grew apathetic towards the space program and Congress continued to cut NASA's budget; [[Apollo 20]] was canceled.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=285}} Despite the successful lunar landing, the missions were considered so risky that astronauts could not afford life insurance to provide for their families if they died in space.{{NoteTag|No Apollo astronaut flew without life insurance, but the policies were paid for by private third parties whose involvement was not publicized.&lt;ref name = &quot;weinberger&quot; /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberger|first=Howard C.|title=Apollo Insurance Covers|publisher=Space Flown Artifacts (Chris Spain)|url=http://www.spaceflownartifacts.com/flown_apollo_insurance_covers.html|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the first U.S. astronaut entered space in 1961, planning for a centralized facility to communicate with the spacecraft and monitor its performance had begun, for the most part the brainchild of [[Christopher C. Kraft]], who became NASA's first [[Flight controller#Flight director|flight director]]. During [[John Glenn]]'s Mercury ''[[Friendship 7]]'' flight in February 1962 (the first crewed orbital flight by the U.S.), Kraft was overruled by NASA managers. He was vindicated by post-mission analysis, and implemented a rule that during the mission, the flight director's word was absolute&lt;ref name = &quot;mission control history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Neufeld|first=Michael J.|authorlink=Michael J. Neufeld|title=Remembering Chris Kraft: Pioneer of Mission Control|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/remembering-chris-kraft-pioneer-mission-control|publisher=[[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]]|date=July 24, 2019|accessdate=December 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to overrule him, NASA would have to fire him on the spot.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 1&quot; /&gt; Flight directors during Apollo had a one-sentence job description, &quot;The flight director may take any actions necessary for crew safety and mission success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A legendary tale, well-told|accessdate=October 5, 2019|last=Williams|first=Mike|url=https://news.rice.edu/2012/09/13/a-legendary-tale-well-told/|publisher=Rice University Office of Public Affairs|date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Houston's [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] opened, in part designed by Kraft and now named for him.&lt;ref name = &quot;mission control history&quot; /&gt;  In Mission Control, each flight controller, as well as monitoring [[telemetry]] from the spacecraft, was in communication via voice loop to specialists in a Staff Support Room (or &quot;back room&quot;), who focused on specific spacecraft systems.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 1&quot; /&gt;

Apollo 13 was to be the second [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|H mission]], meant to demonstrate precision lunar landings and explore specific sites on the Moon.{{sfn|Apollo Program Summary Report|1975|p=B-2}} With Kennedy's goal accomplished by Apollo 11, and [[Apollo 12]] demonstrating that the astronauts could perform a precision landing, mission planners were able to focus on more than just landing safely and having astronauts minimally trained in geology gather lunar samples to take home to Earth. There was a greater role for science on Apollo&amp;nbsp;13, especially for geology, something emphasized by the mission's motto, ''Ex luna, scientia'' (From the Moon, knowledge).{{sfn|Launius|2019|p=186}}

== Astronauts and key Mission Control personnel ==
Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's mission commander, [[Jim Lovell]], was 42 years old at the time of the spaceflight, which was his fourth and last. He was a graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]] and had been a naval aviator and [[test pilot]] before being selected for the [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|second group of astronauts]] in 1962; he flew with [[Frank Borman]] in [[Gemini&amp;nbsp;7]] in 1965 and Aldrin in [[Gemini&amp;nbsp;12]] the following year before flying in [[Apollo 8]] in 1968, the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|pp=108–109}}

[[Jack Swigert]], the command module pilot (CMP), was 38&amp;nbsp;years old and held a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in mechanical engineering and an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in aerospace science; he had served in the Air Force and in state [[Air National Guard]]s, and was an engineering test pilot before being selected for the [[NASA Astronaut Group 5|fifth group of astronauts]] in 1966.&lt;ref name = &quot;swigert bio&quot; /&gt; [[Fred Haise]], the lunar module pilot (LMP), was 35 years old. He held a B.S. in aeronautical engineering, had been a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] fighter pilot, and was a civilian research pilot for NASA when he was selected as a Group{{nbsp}}5 astronaut.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|pp=111–112}} Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 was Swigert's and Haise's only spaceflight.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=589–593}}
[[File:Apollo 13 crew before launch.png|thumb|left|alt=see caption|Swigert, Lovell and Haise the day before launch]]
According to the standard Apollo crew rotation, the prime crew for Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 would have been the backup crew{{NoteTag|The role of the backup crew was to train and be prepared to fly in the event something happened to the prime crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 5, 2019|title=50 years ago: NASA names Apollo 11 crew|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-nasa-names-apollo-11-crew|date=January 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backup crews, according to the rotation, were assigned as the prime crew three missions after their assignment as backups.{{sfn|Slayton &amp; Cassutt|1994|p=137}}}} for [[Apollo 10]] with Mercury and Gemini veteran [[Gordon Cooper]] in command, [[Donn F. Eisele]] as CMP and [[Edgar Mitchell]] as LMP. [[Deke Slayton]], NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, never intended to rotate Cooper and Eisele to a prime crew assignment, as both were out of favor{{snd}}Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7|Apollo{{nbsp}}7]] and an extramarital affair. He assigned them to the backup crew because no other veteran astronauts were available.{{sfn|Slayton &amp; Cassutt|1994|p=236}} Slayton's original choices for Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 were [[Alan Shepard]] as commander, [[Stuart Roosa]] as CMP, and Mitchell as LMP. However, management felt Shepard needed more training time, as he had only recently resumed active status after surgery for an [[Meniere's disease|inner ear disorder]], and had not flown since 1961. Thus Lovell's crew (himself, Haise and [[Ken Mattingly]]) having all backed up Apollo 11 and slated for [[Apollo 14]], was swapped with Shepard's.{{sfn|Slayton &amp; Cassutt|1994|p=236}}

Swigert was originally CMP of Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's backup crew, with [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] as commander and [[Charles Duke]] as lunar module pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;backup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/landing-missions/apollo13-crew.cfm|title=Apollo 13 Crew|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven days before launch, Duke contracted [[rubella]] from a friend of his son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles M.

Of the five, only Mattingly was not immune through prior exposure. Normally, if any member of the prime crew had to be grounded, the remaining crew would be replaced as well, and the backup crew substituted, but Duke's illness ruled this out,{{sfn|NASA 1970|p=6}} so two days before launch, Mattingly was replaced by Swigert.&lt;ref name = &quot;swigert bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/swigert-jl.html|accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Astronaut Bio: John L.

For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts, known as the support crew, was designated in addition to the prime and backup crews used on projects Mercury and Gemini. Slayton created the support crews because [[James McDivitt]], who would command [[Apollo 9]], believed that, with preparation going on in facilities across the US, meetings that needed a member of the flight crew would be missed. Support crew members were to assist as directed by the mission commander.{{sfn|Slayton &amp; Cassutt|1994|p=184}} Usually low in seniority, they assembled the mission's rules, [[flight plan]], and checklists, and kept them updated;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersch|first=Matthew|date=July 19, 2009|title=The fourth crewmember|journal=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]]|accessdate=October 4, 2019|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/space/the-fourth-crewmember-37046329/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brooks, Grimwood, &amp; Swenson|1979|p=261}} for Apollo&amp;nbsp;13, they were [[Vance D.

For Apollo&amp;nbsp;13, flight directors were: [[Gene Kranz]], White team,{{sfn|Mission Operations Report 1970|p=I-1}} (the lead flight director);{{sfn|Kranz|2000|p=307}}{{sfn|Lovell &amp; Kluger|2000|p=79}} [[Glynn Lunney]], Black team; [[Milt Windler]], Maroon team and [[Gerald D.

[[File:Apollo 13 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-354).jpg|thumb|alt=see caption|Apollo 13 flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 mission insignia depicts the Greek god of the Sun, [[Apollo]], with three horses pulling his chariot across the face of the Moon, and the Earth seen in the distance. This is meant to symbolize the Apollo flights bringing the light of knowledge to all people. The mission motto, ''Ex luna, scientia'' (From the Moon, knowledge), appears. In choosing it, Lovell adapted the motto of his alma mater, the Naval Academy, ''Ex scientia, tridens'' (From knowledge, sea power).{{sfn|Lovell &amp; Kluger|2000|p=81}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=283}}

On the patch, the mission number appeared in [[Roman numerals]] as Apollo XIII. It did not have to be modified after Mattingly's replacement by Swigert since it is one of only two Apollo mission insignia—the other being Apollo 11—not to include the names of the crew. It was designed by artist [[Lumen Martin Winter]], who based it on a mural he had painted for [[The St. Regis Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36238158/daily_news/|title=Astros Wear Badge of Apollo|last1=Crafton|first1=Jean|date=April 12, 1970|page=105|newspaper=Daily News|location=New York, New York|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural was later purchased by actor [[Tom Hanks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/ct-lns-moran-lovell-stories-st-1003-20151002-story.html|title=Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell shares stories about Tom Hanks, Ron Howard|last1=Moran|first1=Dan|date=October 2, 2015|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; who portrayed Lovell in the movie ''[[Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&amp;nbsp;13]]'', and is now in the [[Captain James A.

The mission's motto was in Lovell's mind when he chose the call sign ''Aquarius'' for the lunar module, taken from [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], the bringer of water.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=291}}{{sfn|Lovell &amp; Kluger|2000|p=87}} Some in the media erroneously reported that the call sign was taken from [[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|a song by that name]] from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.{{sfn|Lovell &amp; Kluger|2000|p=87}}{{sfn|Lattimer|1988|p=77}} The command module's call sign, ''Odyssey'', was chosen not only for its [[Odyssey|Homeric association]] but to refer to the recent movie, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', based on [[The Sentinel (short story)|a short story]] by [[science fiction]] author [[Arthur C. Clarke]].{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=291}} In his book, Lovell indicated he chose the name ''Odyssey'' because he liked the word and its definition: a long voyage with many changes of fortune.{{sfn|Lovell &amp; Kluger|2000|p=87}}

The Saturn V rocket used to carry Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 to the Moon was numbered SA-508, and was almost identical to those used on Apollo{{nbsp}}8 through 12.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=74}} Including the spacecraft, the rocket weighed in at {{convert|6501733|lb|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=284}} The [[S-IC]] stage's engines were rated to generate {{convert|100000|lbf|N|order=flip|-4}} less total thrust than Apollo 12's, though they remained within specifications. Extra propellant was carried as a test since future [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|J missions]] to the Moon would require more propellant for their heavier payloads.

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 spacecraft consisted of Command Module&amp;nbsp;109 and Service Module&amp;nbsp;109 (together CSM-109), called ''Odyssey'', and Lunar Module{{nbsp}}7 (LM-7), called ''Aquarius''. Also considered part of the spacecraft were the [[launch escape system]] which would propel the command module (CM) to safety in the event of a problem during liftoff, and the Spacecraft–LM Adapter, numbered as SLA-16, which housed the lunar module (LM) during the first hours of the mission.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=364}}{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|pp=78, 81}}

The LM stages, CM and service module (SM) were received at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in June 1969; the portions of the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V were received in June and July. Thereafter, testing and assembly proceeded, culminating with the rollout of the launch vehicle, with the spacecraft atop it, on December 15, 1969.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=364}} Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 was originally scheduled for launch on March 12, 1970; in January of that year NASA announced the mission would be postponed until April 11, both to allow more time for planning and to spread the Apollo missions over a longer period of time.&lt;ref name = &quot;postpone&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=MSC 70–9|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=January 8, 1970|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/83122main_1970.pdf | access-date = July 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to have two Apollo flights per year, and was in response to budgetary constraints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apollo's Schedule Shifted by NASA|date=January 9, 1970|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=17|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/09/archives/apollos-schedule-shifted-by-nasa-next-flight-in-april.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had recently seen the cancellation of Apollo 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apollo 13 and 14 may be set back|date=January 6, 1970|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=26|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/06/archives/apollo-13-and-14-may-be-set-back.html|agency=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and preparation ==
[[File:Lovell deploying the flag.jpg|thumb|upright|Lovell practices deploying the flag]]

The Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 prime crew undertook over 1,000 hours of mission-specific training, more than five hours for every hour of the mission's ten-day planned duration. Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 1&quot; /&gt;  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}

The astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103–104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense. At the end of their week together, Lovell made Silver their geology mentor, who would be extensively involved in the geology planning for Apollo&amp;nbsp;13.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=107–111}} [[Farouk El-Baz]] oversaw the training of Mattingly and his backup, Swigert, which involved describing and photographing simulated lunar landmarks from airplanes.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=134}} El-Baz had all three prime crew astronauts describe geologic features they saw during their flights between Houston and KSC; Mattingly's enthusiasm caused other astronauts, such as Apollo 14's CMP, Roosa, to seek out El-Baz as a teacher.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=141–142}}

Concerned about how close Apollo 11's LM, ''Eagle'', had come to running out of propellant during its lunar descent, mission planners decided that beginning with Apollo&amp;nbsp;13, the CSM would bring the LM to the low orbit from which the landing attempt would commence. This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}

The plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the &quot;[[Vomit Comet]]&quot; in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits. To prepare for the descent to the Moon's surface, Lovell flew the [[Lunar Landing Training Vehicle]] (LLTV).{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=105}} Despite the fact that four of the five LLTVs and similar Lunar Landing Research Vehicles crashed during the course of the Apollo program, mission commanders considered flying them invaluable experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|title=Lunar Landing Training Vehicle NASA 952|date=April 29, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's designated landing site was near [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro crater]]; the [[Fra Mauro formation]] was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the [[Imbrium basin]] early in the Moon's history. Dating it would provide information not only about the Moon, but about the Earth's early history. Such material was likely to be available at [[Cone (crater)|Cone crater]], a site where an impact was believed to have drilled deep into the lunar [[regolith]].{{sfn|Harland|1999|pp=51–53}}

Apollo 11 had left a [[seismometer]] on the Moon, but the solar-powered unit did not survive its first two-week-long lunar night. The Apollo 12 astronauts [[Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment|also left one]] as part of its ALSEP, which was nuclear-powered.{{sfn|Harland|1999|pp=38–39}} Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 also carried a seismometer (known as the Passive Seismic Experiment, or PSE), similar to Apollo 12's, as part of its ALSEP,  to be left on the Moon by the astronauts.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=29}} That seismometer was to be calibrated by the impact, after jettison, of the ascent stage of Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's LM, an object of known mass and velocity impacting at a known location.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=42}}

Other ALSEP experiments on Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 included a Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), which would involve drilling two holes {{convert|10|ft|order=flip}} deep.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=33}} This was Haise's responsibility; he was also to drill a third hole of that depth for a core sample.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1970-04-04|p=354}} A Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE) measured the protons and electrons of solar origin reaching the Moon.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=49}} The package also included a Lunar Atmosphere Detector (LAD){{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970||p=51}} and a Dust Detector, to measure the accumulation of debris.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=62}} The Heat Flow Experiment and the CPLEE were flown for the first time on Apollo&amp;nbsp;13; the other experiments had been flown before.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1970-04-04|p=354}}

To power the ALSEP, the [[SNAP-27]] radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) was flown. Developed by the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], SNAP-27 was first flown on Apollo 12. The fuel capsule contained about {{convert|8.36|lb|order=flip}} of [[Plutonium(IV) oxide|plutonium oxide]]. The cask placed around the capsule for transport to the Moon was built with heat shields of graphite and of beryllium, and with structural parts of titanium and of [[Inconel]] materials. Thus, it was built to withstand the heat of reentry into the Earth's atmosphere rather than pollute the air with plutonium in the event of an aborted mission.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=65}}

A United States flag was also taken, to be erected on the Moon's surface.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|pp=33, 65}} For Apollo 11 and 12, the flag had been placed in a heat-resistant tube on the front landing leg; it was moved for Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 to the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) in the LM descent stage. [[Lunar Flag Assembly|The structure to fly the flag]] on the airless Moon was improved from Apollo 12's.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=73}} Since Lovell and Haise were to undertake longer traverses than on the earlier missions, the tool carrier which the Apollo 12 astronauts had hand-carried was expanded, given two wheels, and dubbed the [[Modular Equipment Transporter]].{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=81}}

For the first time, red stripes were placed on the helmet, arms and legs of the commander's [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|A7L]] spacesuit.

The mission was launched at the planned time, 2:13:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] (19:13:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) on April 11. An anomaly occurred when the second-stage, center (inboard) engine shut down about two minutes early.&lt;ref name=&quot;lver&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Saturn 5 Launch Vehicle Flight Evaluation Report: AS-508 Apollo 13 Mission |url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19900066486 |accessdate=May 30, 2017 |date=June 20, 1970 |work=[[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C.

In spite of the shutdown, the four outboard engines and the [[S-IVB]] third stage burned longer to compensate, and the vehicle achieved very close to the planned circular {{convert|100|nmi|km|order=flip|sp=us}} [[parking orbit]], followed by a translunar injection (TLI) about two hours later, setting the mission on course for the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;lver&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Benson &amp; Faherty|1979|pp=494–499}}

[[Jack Lousma]], the [[Flight controller#CAPCOM|CAPCOM]], sent minor instructions to Swigert, including changing the [[attitude (geometry)|attitude]] of the craft to facilitate photography of [[Comet Bennett]].&lt;ref name = &quot;journal Houston&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=292}}

The pressure sensor in one of the SM's oxygen tanks had earlier appeared to be malfunctioning, so [[Sy Liebergot]] (the [[EECOM]], in charge of monitoring the CSM's electrical system) requested that the stirring fans in the tanks be activated. Normally this was done once daily; this additional stir would [[Thermal destratification|destratify]] the contents of the tanks, making the pressure readings more accurate.&lt;ref name = &quot;journal Houston&quot; /&gt; The Flight Director, Kranz, had Liebergot wait a few minutes for the crew to settle down after the telecast,{{sfn|Houston, Heflin &amp; Aaron|2015|p=207}} then Lousma relayed the request to Swigert, who activated the switches controlling the fans,&lt;ref name = &quot;journal Houston&quot; /&gt; and after a few seconds turned them off again.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=292}}

{{Listen|filename=Apollo13-wehaveaproblem.ogg|title=Houston, we've had a problem.|description=Swigert and Lovell reporting the incident on April 14, 1970 [2:59] &quot;[[Houston, we've had a problem]]&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ninety-five seconds after Swigert activated those switches,{{sfn|Houston, Heflin &amp; Aaron|2015|p=207}} the astronauts heard a &quot;pretty large bang&quot;, accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and the firing of the attitude control thrusters.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=368}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=152–157}} Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8&amp;nbsp;seconds, until the system automatically corrected by switching the [[directional antenna|high-gain]] [[Unified S-band|S-band]] antenna, used for translunar communications, from narrow-beam to wide-beam mode.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-44}} The accident happened at 55:54:53; Swigert reported 26&amp;nbsp;seconds later, [[Houston, we have a problem|&quot;Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here,&quot;]] echoed at 55:55:42 by Lovell, &quot;Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a Main&amp;nbsp;B Bus undervolt.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;journal Houston&quot; /&gt;

Lovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&amp;nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage. Haise checked the status of the fuel cells, and found that two of them were dead. Mission rules forbade entering lunar orbit unless all fuel cells were operational.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293–294}}

In the minutes after the accident, there were several unusual readings, showing that tank{{nbsp}}2 was empty and tank{{nbsp}}1's pressure slowly falling, that the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|computer on the spacecraft]] had reset, and that the high-gain antenna was not working. Liebergot initially missed the worrying signs from tank{{nbsp}}2 following the stir, as he was focusing on tank{{nbsp}}1, believing that its reading would be a good guide to what was present in tank{{nbsp}}2; so did controllers supporting him in the &quot;back room&quot;.  When Kranz questioned Liebergot on this he initially responded that there might be false readings due to an instrumentation problem; he was often teased about that in the years to come.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution|date=April 1, 2005|accessdate=August 30, 2019|website=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovell, looking out the window, reported &quot;a gas of some sort&quot; venting into space, making it clear that there was a serious problem.{{sfn|Houston, Heflin &amp; Aaron|2015|p=215}}

Since the fuel cells needed oxygen to operate, when Oxygen Tank{{nbsp}}1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell would shut down, meaning the CSM's only significant sources of power and oxygen would be the CM's batteries and its oxygen &quot;surge tank&quot;. These would be needed for the final hours of the mission, but the remaining fuel cell, already starved for oxygen, was drawing from the surge tank. Kranz ordered the surge tank isolated, saving its oxygen, but this meant that the remaining fuel cell would die within two hours, as the oxygen in tank{{nbsp}}1 was consumed or leaked away.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293–294}} The volume surrounding the spacecraft was filled with myriad small bits of debris from the accident, complicating any efforts to use the stars for navigation.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=299}}  The mission's goal became simply getting the astronauts back to Earth alive.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 2&quot; /&gt;

A key decision was the choice of return path. A &quot;direct abort&quot; would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297–298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&amp;nbsp;seconds took Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=369}}

The change would get Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R. Gilruth]], decided on a burn using the DPS, that would save 12&amp;nbsp;hours and land Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 in the Pacific. This &quot;PC+2&quot; burn would take place two hours after [[pericynthion]], the closest approach to the Moon.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 2&quot; /&gt;  At pericynthion, Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 set the record (per the ''Guinness Book of World Records''), which still stands, for the highest absolute altitude attained by a crewed spacecraft: {{convert|400171|km|sp=us}} from Earth at 7:21&amp;nbsp;pm EST, April 14 (00:21:00&amp;nbsp;UTC April 15).{{sfn|Glenday|2010|p=13}}{{NoteTag|The record was set because  the Moon was nearly at [[apogee|its furthest from Earth]] during the mission. Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's unique free return trajectory caused it to go approximately {{convert|100|km|-1|sp=us}} further from the [[Far side (Moon)|lunar far side]] than other Apollo lunar missions, but this was a minor contribution to the record.{{sfn|Adamo|2009|p=37}} A reconstruction of the trajectory by astrodynamicist Daniel Adamo in 2009 records the furthest distance as {{convert|400046|km|sp=us}} at 7:34&amp;nbsp;pm&amp;nbsp;EST (00:34:13&amp;nbsp;UTC). Apollo 10 holds the record for second-furthest at a distance of {{convert|399806|km|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Adamo|2009|p=41}}}}

While preparing for the burn the crew was told that the S-IVB had impacted the Moon as planned, leading Lovell to quip, &quot;Well, at least something worked on this flight.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;journal leaving&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Cooper|2013|pp=84–86}} Kranz's White team of mission controllers, which had spent most of their time supporting other teams and developing the procedures urgently needed to get the astronauts home, took their consoles for the PC+2 procedure.{{sfn|Houston, Heflin &amp; Aaron|2015|pp=221–222}} Normally, the accuracy of such a burn could be assured by checking the alignment Lovell had transferred to the LM's computer against the position of one of the stars astronauts used for navigation, but the light glinting off the many pieces of debris accompanying the spacecraft made that impractical. The astronauts used the one star available whose position could not be obscured – the Sun. Houston also informed them that the Moon would be centered in the commander's window of the LM as they made the burn, which was almost perfect{{snd}}less than 0.3 meters (a foot) per second off.&lt;ref name = &quot;journal leaving&quot; /&gt; The burn, at 79:27:38.95, lasted four minutes, 23&amp;nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=391}} The crew then shut down most LM systems to conserve consumables.&lt;ref name = &quot;journal leaving&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Apollo Lunar Flight Journal|url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap13fj/13day4-leaving-moon.html|title=Day 4: Leaving the Moon|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to earth ===
[[File:Apollo13 apparatus.jpg|thumb|Swigert with the rig improvised to adapt the CM's [[lithium hydroxide]] canisters for use in the LM]]

The LM carried enough oxygen, but that still left the problem of [[carbon dioxide scrubber|removing carbon dioxide]], which was absorbed by canisters of [[lithium hydroxide]] pellets. 
The LM's stock of canisters, meant to accommodate two astronauts for 45 hours on the Moon, was not enough to support three astronauts for the return journey to Earth.{{sfn|Houston, Heflin &amp; Aaron|2015|p=224}} The CM had enough canisters, but they were the wrong shape and size to work in the LM's equipment. Engineers on the ground devised a way to bridge the gap, using plastic, covers ripped from procedures manuals, duct tape, and other items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36237422/detroit_free_press/|title=Astronauts Beat Air Crisis By Do-It-Yourself Gadget|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|location=Detroit, Michigan|date=April 16, 1970|page=12-C|last1=Pothier|first1=Richard|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Barell|2016|p=154}} NASA engineers referred to the improvised device as &quot;the mailbox&quot;. The procedure for building the device was read to the crew by CAPCOM [[Joe Kerwin]] over the course of an hour, and it was built by Swigert and Haise; carbon dioxide levels began dropping immediately. Lovell later described this improvisation as &quot;a fine example of cooperation between ground and space&quot;.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=257–262}}

The CSM's electricity came from fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, but the LM was powered by [[Silver-oxide battery|silver-zinc batteries]], so both electrical power and water (needed for equipment cooling as well as drinking) would be critical. LM power consumption was reduced to the lowest level possible;{{sfn|Mission Operations Report 1970|pp=III‑17, III-33, III-40}} Swigert was able to fill some drinking bags with water from the CM's water tap,&lt;ref name = &quot;journal leaving&quot; /&gt; but even assuming rationing of personal consumption, Haise initially calculated they would run out of water for cooling about five hours before reentry. This seemed acceptable because the systems of Apollo 11's LM, once jettisoned in lunar orbit, had continued to operate for seven to eight hours even with the water cut off. In the end, Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 returned to Earth with {{convert|28.2|lb|order=flip}} of water remaining.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=254–257}} The crew's ration was 0.2 liters of water per person per day; the three astronauts lost a total of {{convert|31|lb|order=flip}} among them, and Haise developed a [[urinary tract infection]].&lt;ref name = &quot;mission summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|date=January 4, 2006|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/a13.summary.html|title=The frustrations of Fra Mauro: Part I|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=September 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=262–263}}. This infection was probably caused by the reduced water intake, but microgravity and effects of cosmic radiation might have impaired his immune system's reaction to the pathogen. The exact pathogen causing Haise's infection, the [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] bacterium, supports this hypothesis since these normally don't cause urinary tract infections. &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, A.R.

Inside the darkened spacecraft, the temperature dropped as low as {{convert|38|F|order=flip}}. Lovell considered having the crew don their spacesuits, but decided this would be too hot. Instead, Lovell and Haise wore their lunar EVA boots and Swigert put on an extra coverall. All three astronauts were cold, especially Swigert, who had got his feet wet while filling the water bags and had no lunar overshoes (since he had not been scheduled to walk on the Moon). As they had been told not to discharge their urine to space to avoid disturbing the trajectory, they had to store it in bags. Water condensed on the walls, though any condensation there may have been behind equipment panels{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=257–263}} caused no problems, partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the [[Apollo 1]] fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/main/A13_panel.html|title=Generation Constellation Learns about Apollo 13|last=Siceloff|first=Steven|date=September 20, 2007|work=[[Constellation program|Constellation Program]]|publisher=NASA|accessdate=September 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this the crew voiced few complaints.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 3|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-3|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flight controller [[John Aaron]], along with Mattingly and several engineers and designers, devised a procedure for powering up the command module from full shutdown{{snd}}something never intended to be done in flight, much less under Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's severe power and time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leopold|first=George|date=March 17, 2009|title=Power engineer: Video interview with Apollo astronaut Ken Mattingly|journal=[[EE Times]]|publisher=UMB Tech|url=https://www.eetimes.com/power-engineer-video-interview-with-apollo-astronaut-ken-mattingly/|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts implemented the procedure without apparent difficulty: Kranz later credited the fact that all three astronauts had been test pilots, accustomed to having to work in critical situations with their lives on the line, for their survival.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 3&quot; /&gt;

=== Reentry and splashdown ===

Despite the accuracy of the transearth injection, the spacecraft slowly drifted off course, necessitating a correction. As the LM's guidance system had been shut down following the PC+2 burn, the crew was told to use the line between night and day on the Earth to guide them, a technique used on NASA's earth-orbit missions but never on the way back from the Moon.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 3&quot; /&gt; This DPS burn, at 105:18:42 for 14&amp;nbsp;seconds, brought the projected entry flight path angle back within safe limits. Nevertheless, yet another burn was needed at 137:40:13, using the LM's [[reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters, for 21.5&amp;nbsp;seconds. The SM was jettisoned less than half an hour later, allowing the crew to see the damage for the first time, and photograph it. They reported that an entire panel was missing from the SM's exterior, the fuel cells above the oxygen tank shelf were tilted, that the high-gain antenna was damaged, and there was a considerable amount of debris elsewhere.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|pp=370–371}} Haise could see damage to the SM's engine bell, validating Kranz's decision not to use the SPS.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 3&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Apollo13 splashdown.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Spaceship contacts ocean under parachute|Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 splashes down in the South Pacific on April 17, 1970]]

The last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before reentry. The normal procedure, in lunar orbit, was to release the LM then use the service module's RCS to pull the CSM away, but by this point the SM had already been released. [[Grumman]], manufacturer of the LM, assigned a team of University of Toronto engineers, led by senior scientist [[Bernard Etkin]], to solve the problem of how much air pressure to use to push the modules apart. The astronauts applied the solution, which was successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernard Etkin helped avert Apollo 13 tragedy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/bernard-etkin-helped-avert-apollo-13-tragedy/article19735265/#dashboard/follows/|accessdate=September 7, 2019|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LM reentered Earth's atmosphere and was destroyed, the remaining pieces falling in the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_impact.html|title=Impact Sites of Apollo LM Ascent and SIVB Stages|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=August 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LM-ALSEP&quot; /&gt; Apollo&amp;nbsp;13's final midcourse correction had addressed the concerns of the Atomic Energy Commission, which wanted the cask containing the plutonium oxide intended for the SNAP-27 RTG to land in a safe place.

Later helicopter surveys found no radioactive leakage.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cass 3&quot; /&gt;

Ionization of the air around the command module during reentry would typically cause a four-minute communications blackout.

Worldwide interest in the Apollo program was reawakened by the incident; television coverage of which was seen by millions. Four Soviet ships headed toward the landing area to assist if needed,{{sfn|NASA 1970|p=15}} and other nations offered assistance should the craft have to splash down elsewhere.{{sfn|Benson &amp; Faherty|1979|pp=489–494}} President Nixon canceled appointments, phoned the astronauts' families, and drove to NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], where Apollo's tracking and communications were coordinated.{{sfn|NASA 1970|p=15}}

The rescue received more public attention than any spaceflight to that point, other than the first Moon landing on Apollo 11. There were worldwide headlines, and people surrounded television sets to get the latest developments, offered by networks who interrupted their regular programming for bulletins. [[Pope Paul VI]] led a congregation of 10,000 people in praying for the astronauts' safe return; ten times that number offered prayers at a religious festival in India.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=316}} The [[United States Senate]] on April 14 passed a resolution urging businesses to pause at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm local time that evening to allow for employee prayer.{{sfn|NASA 1970|p=15}}

found that the failure began in the service module's number{{nbsp}}2 oxygen tank.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-36}} Damaged [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation on the wires to the stirring fan inside Oxygen Tank{{nbsp}}2 allowed the wires to [[short circuit|short-circuit]] and ignite this insulation.

The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&amp;nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|pp=372–373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Oxygen Tank&amp;nbsp;2 was manufactured by the [[Beech Aircraft Company]] of Boulder, Colorado, as subcontractor to [[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]] (NAR) of Downey, California, prime contractor for the CSM.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-2}} It contained two thermostatic switches, originally designed for the command module's 28-volt DC power, but which could fail if subjected to the 65 volts used during ground testing at KSC.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} Under the original 1962 specifications, the switches would be rated for 28 volts, but revised specifications issued in 1965 called for 65 volts to allow for quicker tank pressurization at KSC. Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff &amp; Harland|2006|p=374}}

At NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&amp;nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&amp;nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}

The [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&amp;nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&amp;nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen.

[[File:Apollo 14 redesigned oxygen tank (S71-16745).jpg|thumb|Redesigned oxygen tank for Apollo{{nbsp}}14]]

For [[Apollo 14]] and subsequent missions, the oxygen tank was redesigned, the thermostats being upgraded to handle the proper voltage. The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate. This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only. The quantity probe was upgraded from aluminum to stainless steel.{{sfn|Apollo 14 Press Kit|1971|pp=96–97}}

All electrical wiring in Bay{{nbsp}}4 was sheathed in stainless steel. The fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen. The spacecraft and Mission Control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} An emergency supply of {{convert|5|USgal|l|order=flip}} of water was stored in the CM, and an emergency battery, identical to those that powered the LM's descent stage, was placed in the SM. The LM was modified to make transfer of power from LM to CM easier.{{sfn|Apollo 14 Press Kit|1971|pp=96–98}} Devices were placed in the [[S-II]] second stage to counteract pogo oscillations.{{sfn|Apollo 14 Press Kit|1971|p=95}}

The 1974 movie ''[[Houston, We've Got a Problem]]'', while set around the Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 incident, is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places further stress on their lives. Lovell publicly complained about the movie, saying it was &quot;fictitious and in poor taste&quot;.&lt;ref name=irks&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35088956/the_south_bend_tribune/|title=Apollo 13 Movie Irks Lovell|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The South Bend Tribune|location=South Bend, Indiana|date=February 28, 1974|page=5|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/04/13/houston-we-have-a-problem-the-amazing-history-of-the-iconic-apollo-13-misquote/|title='Houston, we have a problem': The amazing history of the iconic Apollo 13 misquote|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521183910/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/04/13/houston-we-have-a-problem-the-amazing-history-of-the-iconic-apollo-13-misquote/|archive-date=May 21, 2019|url-status=live|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 13, 2017|last1=Rosenwald|first1=Michael S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Houston{{nbsp}}... We've Got a Problem&quot; was the title of an episode of the [[BBC]] documentary series ''A Life At Stake'', broadcast in March 1978. This was an accurate, if simplified, reconstruction of the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35940813/the_observer/|title=The Week in View|last1=Meades|first1=Jonathan|newspaper=The Observer|location=London, England|date=March 26, 1978|page=29|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, during the [[Apollo 11 anniversaries|25th anniversary of Apollo 11]], PBS released a 90-minute documentary titled ''Apollo&amp;nbsp;13: To the Edge and Back''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35947551/chicago_tribune/|title=Wednesday Highlights|department=TV Week|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 17, 1994|page=25|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35947573/florida_today/|title=Space Specials at a Glance|newspaper=Florida Today|department=TV Week|location=Cocoa, Florida|date=July 17, 1994|page=3|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the flight, the crew planned to write a book, but they all left NASA without starting it. After Lovell retired in 1991, he was approached by journalist [[Jeffrey Kluger]] about writing a non-fiction account of the mission. Swigert died in 1982 and Haise was no longer interested in such a project. The resultant book, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo&amp;nbsp;13]]'', was published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39589313/the_postcrescent_11_december_1994/|title=Lovell Describes the Dark Side of Moon Shots|newspaper=The Post-Crescent|location=Appleton, Wisconsin|agency=Associated Press|last1=Dunn|first1=Marcia|date=December 11, 1994|page=F-8|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, in 1995, a film adaptation of the book, ''[[Apollo&amp;nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&amp;nbsp;13]]'', was released, directed by [[Ron Howard]] and starring [[Tom Hanks]] as Lovell, [[Bill Paxton]] as Haise, [[Kevin Bacon]] as Swigert, [[Gary Sinise]] as Mattingly, [[Ed Harris]] as Kranz, and [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Marilyn Lovell. James Lovell, Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, given that some [[dramatic license]] was taken. For example, the film changes the tense of Lovell's famous follow-up to Swigert's original words from, &quot;Houston, we've had a problem&quot; to &quot;[[Houston, we have a problem]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;journal Houston&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nasaMembers&quot; /&gt; The film also invented the phrase &quot;[[Failure Is Not an Option|Failure is not an option]]&quot;, uttered by Harris as Kranz in the film; the phrase became so closely associated with Kranz that he used it for the title of his 2000 autobiography.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasaMembers&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/members-of-apollo-13-team-reflect-on-nasas-finest-hour|title=Members of Apollo 13 Team Reflect on 'NASA's Finest Hour'|last=Granath|first=Bob|date=April 17, 2015|website=NASA|access-date=July 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won two of the nine Academy Awards it was nominated for, Best Film Editing and Best Sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35088898/the_heraldpalladium/|title=The Winners|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Herald-Palladium|location=Saint Joseph, Michigan|date=March 26, 1996|page=4B|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35088927/st_louis_postdispatch/|title='Braveheart', 'Apollo 13' Lead Oscar Nominees|newspaper=St. Louis Post Dispatch|location=St. Louis, Missouri|date=February 14, 1996|page=4A|via=Newspapers.com|last1=Barnes|first1=Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', co-produced by Hanks and Howard, the mission is dramatized in the episode &quot;We Interrupt This Program&quot;. Rather than showing the incident from the crew's perspective as in the ''Apollo&amp;nbsp;13'' feature film, it is instead presented from an Earth-bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35053645/santa_cruz_sentinel/|title=Tom Hanks Flies us to the Moon via HBO|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel|location=Santa Cruz, California|date=April 5, 1998|page=C-6|agency=The New York Times|via=Newspapers.com|last1=Sterngold|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;
