A '''board of directors''' is a group of people who jointly supervise the activities of an [[organization]], which can be either a for-profit [[business]], [[nonprofit organization]], or a [[government agency]]. Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.

In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s, with the board having ultimate responsibility for the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution, and its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Other names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''board of governors''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''. It may also be called &quot;the executive board&quot; and is often simply referred to as &quot;the board&quot;.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481–483}}

==Roles==
{{Business administration}}
Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and setting out strategic objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]] (of which the titles vary from organization to organization; the chief executive may be titled [[chief executive officer]], [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[executive director]]);
* terminating the chief executive;
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s for the organization's performance;
* setting the salaries, compensation and benefits of senior management;

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and between  jurisdictions. For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.

Typically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;chairperson&quot;), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}

==Directors==
The directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director &quot;inside director&quot;]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director &quot;executive director&quot;]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director &quot;outside director&quot;]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director &quot;nonexecutive director&quot;]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside director===
An inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.&lt;ref name=Ivestopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside director===
{{Main|Independent director}}

An outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Investopedia 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that serves a domestic market only, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate &quot;insider dealing&quot; between inside directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance, and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.

===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===
*'''Director''' – a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.
*'''Inside director''' – a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization
*'''[[Outside director]]''' – a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization
*'''Executive director''' – an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''[[Non-executive director]]''' – an inside director who is not an executive with the organization
*'''Shadow or ''de facto'' director''' – an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization
* '''Nominee director''' – an individual who is appointed by a shareholder, creditor or interest group (whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting) and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointor/s or other interest in the appointing company

Individual directors often serve on more than one board.&lt;ref name=Businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://t.www.na-businesspress.com/AJM/LambN_Web17_2_.pdf|title=Does the Number of Interlocking Directors Influence a Firm's Financial Performance? An Exploratory Meta-Analysis|first=Nai Hua|last1=Lamb|date=2017|journal=American Journal of Management|volume=17|issue=2|pages=47–57|doi=10.33423/ajm.v17i2.1757 |accessdate=2019-07-24|doi-broken-date=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process and structure==

{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=May 2018}}

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142343/http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school|url-status=dead|title=Board Process|archivedate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization in the USA are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] and The Board Group.

===Board meetings===
[[File:Board room at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.jpg|thumb|Typical board room setting]]
A board of directors conducts its meetings according to the rules and procedures contained in its governing documents. These procedures may allow the board to conduct its business by [[conference call]] or other [[Videoconferencing|electronic]] means. They may also specify how a [[quorum]] is to be determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 19)|accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most organizations have adopted ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' as its guide to supplement its own rules{{where|date=November 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/faq/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |quote = &quot;. . . the 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is the current edition of the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the rules for conducting board meetings may be less formal if there is no more than about a dozen board members present.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9–10,487–488}} An example of the informality is that [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] are not required if it's clear what is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 158|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size ===
Historically, nonprofit boards have often had large boards with up to twenty-four members, but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people. Studies suggest that after seven people, each additional person reduces the effectiveness of [[group decision-making]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/NWK6-E3CC|title=For Nonprofit Boards, Smaller is Better|last=White|first=Cyrus|date=|website=perma.cc|publisher=The South Cabin Group LLC|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-corporate boards==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Membership organizations===
In [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]]. The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481–483}}

The setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the &quot;shareholders&quot; are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold. These ex-officio members have all the same rights as the other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the board may be removed before their term is complete. Details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not contain such details, the section on disciplinary procedures in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In a [[public company|publicly held company]], directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the company—the [[shareholder]]s/stockholders.   In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].

===Governance===
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.&lt;ref name=CRI&gt;[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref name=CRI/&gt;

A contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-tier system===
In some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).

===History===
[[File:DirectiekamerVOC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[meeting room]] of the {{ill|Heren XVII|nl}}, the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s board of directors, in the [[Oost-Indisch Huis]] (Amsterdam).

The development of a separate board of directors to manage/govern/oversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that &quot;the directors and the directors alone shall manage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;
See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election and removal ===

{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=May 2018}}

In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shivdasani1999&quot; /&gt; Although in 2002 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASDAQ]] required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y.

''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shivdasani1999&quot; /&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more &quot;gray outsider directors&quot; (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D.

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so &quot;with cause&quot;; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A – a meeting must be held.}} The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985.}} Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous &quot;[[golden parachute]]&quot; which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cai|first=Jay|author2=Garner, Jacqueline |author3=Walkling, Ralph |title = Shareholder Access to the Boardroom: A Survey of Recent Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=15–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sometimes imposes a ban (a &quot;D&amp;O bar&quot;) on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases, and one of these was upheld in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/442382/sec-wins-d-o-bar-against-alleged-hedge-fund-scammer SEC Wins D&amp;O Bar Against Alleged Hedge Fund Scammer]. Law360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise of powers===
The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

===Duties===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that &quot;depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder,&quot; ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== &quot;Proper purpose&quot; ====
Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the &quot;proper purpose&quot; duty as separate from the &quot;good faith&quot; duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}

==== &quot;Unfettered discretion&quot; ====
Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

====&quot;Conflict of duty and interest&quot;====

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

=====Transactions with the company=====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:&quot;A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into...&quot; (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}

===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company (&quot;Company B&quot;) to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B – the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:

: &quot;(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves.&quot;

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

===== Competing with the company =====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

==== Common law duties of care and skill ====
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

: &quot;a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience.&quot; (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

: &quot;such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf.&quot;

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;NormanGoddard&quot;&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Remedies for breach of duty ====
In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

====Current trends====
Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to &quot;soften&quot; the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies &quot;to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole&quot; and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company's employees
* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see, for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php|title=Director's duties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Board of Directors Technology'''

The adoption of technology that facilitates the meeting preparation and execution of directors continues to grow.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-board-portal-market-growth-leading-players-and-forecast-to-2023-2019-09-23|title=Global Board Portal Market Growth, Leading Players And Forecast To 2023.|website=MarketWatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Board directors are increasingly leveraging this technology to communicate and collaborate within a secure environment to access meeting materials, communicate with each other, and execute their governance responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.passageways.com/board-portal/everything-you-need-to-know|title=Board &amp; Committee Meetings {{!}} Board Portal Software {{!}} OnBoard|website=Passageways Board Portal Software|language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is particularly acute in the United States where a robust market of early adopters garnered acceptance of board software by organizations resulting in higher penetration of the board portal services in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

====The Board and Society====

Most companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board &lt;ref&gt;Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009132159/https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ |date=9 October 2018 }}, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society. These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification.

Social Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed. They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.

===United States===

====Sarbanes–Oxley Act====

The [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is a &quot;financial expert.&quot;

The law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) to have a majority of independent directors—directors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it.

====Size====
According to the Corporate Library's study, the average size of publicly traded company's board is 9.2 members, and most boards range from 3 to 31 members. According to Investopedia, some analysts think the ideal size is seven.&lt;ref name=BoD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp#ixzz27Kekd83e |title=Evaluating The Board Of Directors|publisher= investopedia.com|date= 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State law may specify a minimum number of directors, maximum number of directors, and qualifications for directors (e.g. whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities).&lt;ref name=BoD2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/corporate-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Corporate Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoD3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/nonprofit-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Nonprofit Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees====
While a board may have several committees, two—the compensation committee and audit committee—are critical and must be made up of at least three [[independent director]]s and no inside directors. Other common committees in boards are nominating and governance.&lt;ref name=BoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf Compensation Committee Structure, Function and Best Practices] Richard E.

====Compensation====
Directors of [[Fortune 500]] companies received median pay of $234,000 in 2011. Directorship is a part-time job. A recent National Association of Corporate Directors study found directors averaging just 4.3 hours a week on board work.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/story/2011-10-25/director-compensation-rising/50918332/1 | work=USA Today | title=Company directors see pay skyrocket | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys indicate that about 20% of [[nonprofit foundation]]s pay their board members,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schambra&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schambra | first=William A. | title=Board Compensation: To Pay or Not to Pay? | journal=Philanthropy Magazine |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable | url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/compensating_foundation_directors1 | accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2% of American [[nonprofit organization]]s do.{{sfn|BoardSource|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{citation |author=Internal Revenue Service |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |date=4 February 2008 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |quote=Charities should generally not compensate persons for service on the board of directors except to reimburse direct expenses of such service. ...

According to John Gillespie, a former investment banker and co-author of a book critical of boards,&lt;ref&gt;''Money for Nothing: How the Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Far too much of their time has been for check-the-box and cover-your-behind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders&quot;.&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; At the same time, scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousseau|first1=Peter|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|title=Director Histories and the Pattern of Acquisitions|journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=671–698|doi=10.1017/s0022109015000289|url=http://www.accessecon.com/pubs/VUECON/vu11-w24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-border investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroup|first=Caleb|title=International Deal Experience and Cross-Border Acquisitions|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|pages=73–97|date=November 28, 2015|ssrn=2037512|doi=10.1111/ecin.12365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]] has been the subject of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and [[comply or explain]] systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senden|first1=Linda|title=The Multiplicity of Regulatory Responses to Remedy the Gender Imbalance on Company Boards|journal=Utrecht Law Review|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=5|pages=51–66|doi=10.18352/ulr.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, upper-middle classes tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
