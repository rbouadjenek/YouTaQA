{{Paranormal}}

The '''Bermuda Triangle''', also known as the '''Devil's Triangle''' or '''Hurricane Alley''', is a loosely defined region in the western part of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] where a number of [[aircraft]] and [[Surface ship|ships]] are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.

The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is amongst the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, [[Europe]] and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.

[[Popular culture]] has attributed various disappearances to the [[paranormal]] or activity by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]]. Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by later authors.

==Origins==
The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950, article published in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' ([[Associated Press]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/BermudaTriangle/evwjones.html|title=E. V. W. Jones AP article|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Edward Van Winkle Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones,1950&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title = ''Same Big World'', Sea's Puzzles Still Baffle Men In Pushbutton Age| agency = Associated Press| author = E.V.W. Jones
| date = September 16, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine published &quot;Sea Mystery at Our Back Door&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/environment/2016/10/24/has-the-mystery-of-the-bermuda-triangle-finally-been-solved-hexagonal-clouds-florida-bahamas-puerto-rico|title=Has the 'Mystery' of the Bermuda Triangle Finally Been Solved?|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016|date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand,1952&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title = Sea Mystery at Our Back Door| author = George X. San| journal = [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]|date=October 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short article by George Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of [[Flight 19]], a group of five [[US Navy]] [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s on a training mission. Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of ''American Legion'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert,1962&quot; &gt;{{cite journal| title = The Mystery of The Lost Patrol| journal = American Legion Magazine|author = Allen W. Eckert|date=April 1962}} Cited in [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] (editor), ''Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Religion, Folklore, and Popular Culture'', page 72, segment by [[Jerome Clark]] (ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2001). {{ISBN|1-57607-292-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, author [[Allan W. Eckert]] wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, &quot;We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no&lt;!-- NB: &quot;no&quot; is correct, &quot;not&quot; is incorrect&quot;--&gt; white.&quot; He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes &quot;flew off to Mars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diana Formisano Willett, ''Paranormal Fright'', p. 9 (AuthorHouse, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-4817-3268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident.

In February 1964, [[Vincent Gaddis]] wrote an article called &quot;The Deadly Bermuda Triangle&quot; in the pulp magazine ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' saying Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1964&quot;&gt;{{citation|last = Gaddis| first = Vincent|title = The Deadly Bermuda Triangle| journal = Argosy| year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, ''Invisible Horizons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1965&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Invisible Horizons| author = Vincent Gaddis| year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers elaborated on Gaddis' ideas: John Wallace Spencer (''Limbo of the Lost'', 1969, repr. 1973);&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#refSpencer,1969|Spencer, 1969]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Berlitz]] [[The Bermuda Triangle (book)|(''The Bermuda Triangle'', 1974)]];&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#refBerlitz,1974|Berlitz, 1974]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Winer]] (''The Devil's Triangle'', 1974),&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer, 1974&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winer|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert, 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Triangle area===
The Gaddis ''Argosy'' article delineated the boundaries of the triangle,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1964&quot;/&gt; giving its [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] as [[Miami]]; [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]; and [[Bermuda]]. Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy,1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Bermuda Triangle Fact Sheet |year=1998 |url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/UFO/195.pdf |publisher=US Department of Defense |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121111220/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/UFO/195.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from {{convert|1300000|to|3900000|sqkm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=navy,1996/&gt;  &quot;Indeed, some writers even stretch it as far as the Irish coast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA,1976&quot;&gt;{{cite episode

| url=https://archive.org/details/caseofthebermudatrianglereel1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.&lt;ref name=navy,1996/&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

===Larry Kusche {{anchor|Kusche's explanation}}===

[[Larry Kusche]], author of ''The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved'' (1975)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;&gt;[[#refKusche,1975|Kusche, 1975]].&lt;/ref&gt; argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman [[Donald Crowhurst]], which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an ''Atlantic'' port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the ''Pacific'' Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.

Kusche concluded that:
* The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean.
* In an area frequented by [[tropical cyclone]]s, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious.
* Furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this.
* The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been.
* Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937, off [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in front of hundreds of witnesses; a check of the local papers revealed nothing.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;/&gt;

In a 2013 study, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22806362|title =Study finds shipwrecks threaten precious seas|date =7 June 2013|accessdate = 7 June 2013|publisher =BBC News/science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0610/Bermuda-Triangle-doesn-t-make-the-cut-on-list-of-world-s-most-dangerous-oceans | title=Bermuda Triangle doesn't make the cut on list of world's most dangerous oceans | journal=The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate=22 March 2016| date=2013-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further responses===
When the [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] television program ''The Bermuda Triangle'' (1992)&lt;ref name=&quot;BFI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/477884 |title=Equinox: The Bermuda Triangle |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the ''Equinox'' series, the marine insurance market [[Lloyd's of London]] was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodsHole Bermuda&quot;/&gt; Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. [[United States Coast Guard]] records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;/&gt;

The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker {{SS|V. A. Fogg||2}}, the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies,&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG Fogg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/moa/boards/vafog.pdf |title=V A Fogg |publisher=USCG |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  In addition, ''V. A. Fogg'' sank off the coast of [[Texas]], nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle.

The [[Nova (American TV program)|Nova]]/[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]] episode ''The Case of the Bermuda Triangle'', aired on June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that &quot;When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place&amp;nbsp;... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA,1976&quot;/&gt;

Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves&lt;ref name=&quot;Taves,1978&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.

[[Benjamin Radford]], an author and scientific paranormal investigator, noted in an interview on the Bermuda Triangle that it could be very difficult locating an aircraft lost at sea due to the vast search area, and although the disappearance might be mysterious, that did not make it paranormal or unexplainable. Radford further noted the importance of double-checking information as the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle had been created by people who had neglected to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Radford |first1=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford|title=Lessons From A Middle School Bermuda Triangle Q&amp;A |url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/lessons_from_a_middle_school_bermuda_triangle_qa/ |website=Center for Inquiry |accessdate=21 November 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121050210/https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/lessons_from_a_middle_school_bermuda_triangle_qa/ |archivedate=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothetical explanation attempts ==
Persons accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches.

===Paranormal explanations===
Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the [[Bimini Road]] off the island of [[Bimini]] in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic [[Edgar Cayce]] take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968, as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, but the Bimini Road is of natural origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSI,2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-01/geologists-adventures.html |title=A Geologist's Adventures with Bimini Beachrock and Atlantis True Believers |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=January 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406124939/http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-01/geologists-adventures.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers attribute the events to [[UFO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufos.about.com/od/classicufocases/a/bermudatriangle.htm |title=UFO over Bermuda Triangle |publisher=Ufos.about.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochran,2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cochran-Smith | first = Marilyn | year = 2003 | title = Bermuda Triangle: dichotomy, mythology, and amnesia | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 54 | doi = 10.1177/0022487103256793 | page = 275 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Berlitz]], author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;

===Natural explanations===

====Compass variations====
[[Compass]] problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area,&lt;ref name=&quot;USNAVY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle|publisher=US Navy|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural [[magnetic variation]]s in relation to the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]], a fact which navigators have known for centuries. [[magnetic north pole|Magnetic (compass) north]] and [[true north|geographic (true) north]] are exactly the same only for a small number of places – for example, {{as of|2000|lc=y}}, in the United States, only those places on a line running from [[Wisconsin]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;National Geomagnetism Program &amp;#124; Charts &amp;#124; North America &amp;#124; Declination&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|url=http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|accessdate=2010-02-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527143024/http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass &quot;changing&quot; across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Gulfstream1.jpg|thumb|upright|False-color image of the Gulf Stream flowing north through the western Atlantic Ocean. (NASA)]]

====Gulf Stream====
The [[Gulf Stream]] is a major surface current, primarily driven by [[thermohaline circulation]] that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the [[Straits of Florida]] into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects. It has a maximum surface velocity of about {{cvt|2|m/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Pamela|title=The Gulf Stream|url=http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/student/phillips/|publisher=USNA/Johns Hopkins|accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small plane making a [[water landing]] or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.

====Human error====
One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is [[human error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/bermuda-triangle-mystery-disappearance/ |title=Bermuda Triangle: Behind the Intrigue |work=[[National Geographic News]] |access-date=26 May 2009 |date=15 December 2003 |last=Mayell |first=Hillary |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |agency=[[National Geographic Partners, LLC.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht, ''Revonoc'', as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January 1, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Captain Thomas A. |title=Histories &amp; Mysteries: The Shipwrecks of Key Largo |year=1994 |isbn=0941332330 |pages=124 |edition=1st |publisher=Best Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violent weather====
Hurricanes are powerful storms that form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]'s Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane. These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle.

A powerful [[microburst|downdraft of cold air]] was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of ''[[Pride of Baltimore]]'' on May 14, 1986. The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from {{convert|32|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|97|-|145|km/h|abbr=on}}. A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist, James Lushine, stated &quot;during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb, exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h8wlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TPMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1085,6357771|title=''Downdraft likely sank clipper'', The Miami News, May 23, 1986, p. 6A|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event occurred to ''[[Concordia (ship)|Concordia]]'' in 2010, off the coast of [[Brazil]]. Scientists are currently investigating whether &quot;[[hexagon]]al&quot; clouds may be the source of these up-to-{{cvt|170|mph}} &quot;air bombs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Bermuda Triangle Mystery Explained |url=http://www.rdmag.com/article/2016/10/bermuda-triangle-mystery-explained?et_cid=5637693&amp;et_rid=620328802&amp;type=headline&amp;et_cid=5637693&amp;et_rid=620328802&amp;linkid=content |author=Kenny Walter |publisher=RandD Magazine |date=24 October 2016 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methane hydrates====

An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of [[methane]] hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the [[continental shelves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy Citations Database (ECD) – Document #616279&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; any wreckage consequently rising to the surface would be rapidly dispersed by the Gulf Stream. It has been hypothesized that periodic methane [[eruption]]s (sometimes called &quot;[[mud volcano]]es&quot;) may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate [[buoyancy]] for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.

The ''Ellen Austin'' supposedly came across a derelict ship, placed on board  it a [[prize crew]], and attempted to sail in tandem with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, and then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board. A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of ''Meta'', built in 1854, and that in 1880, ''Meta'' was renamed ''Ellen Austin''. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-triangle.org/html/ellen_austin.html |title=Ellen Austin |work=Bermuda-Triangle.Org |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710033354/http://bermuda-triangle.org/html/ellen_austin.html |archive-date=10 July 2012 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Cyclops''===
{{main|USS Cyclops (AC-4)}}

The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier ''Cyclops'', carrying a full load of [[manganese ore]] and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of [[Barbados]]. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that [[World War I|wartime enemy activity]] was to blame for the loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMerrill&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two of ''Cyclops''{{'}}s sister ships, {{USS|Proteus|AC-9|2}} and {{USS|Nereus|AC-10|2}} were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during [[World War II]]. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on ''Cyclops'' during her fatal voyage. In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.

===''Carroll A. Deering''===
{{main|Carroll A. Deering}}

[[File:deering2.jpg|thumb|[[Schooner]] ''[[Carroll A. Deering]]'', as seen from the [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|Cape Lookout]] [[lightvessel]] on January 29, 1921, two days before she was found deserted in [[North Carolina]]. (US Coast Guard)]]

A five-masted schooner built in 1919, ''Carroll A. Deering'' was found hard aground and abandoned at [[Diamond Shoals]], near [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], on January 31, 1921. Rumors and more at the time indicated ''Deering'' was a victim of piracy, possibly connected with the illegal [[rum-running]] trade during [[Prohibition]], and possibly involving another ship, {{SS|Hewitt||2}}, which disappeared at roughly the same time. Just hours later, an unknown steamer sailed near the lightship along the track of ''Deering'', and ignored all signals from the lightship. It is speculated that ''Hewitt'' may have been this mystery ship, and possibly involved in ''Deering''{{'}}s crew disappearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deering&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Flight 19===
{{main|Flight 19}}
[[File:TBF (Avengers) flying in formation.jpg|upright|thumb|US Navy Avengers, similar to those of Flight 19]]
Flight 19 was a training flight of five [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBM Avenger]] torpedo bombers that disappeared on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from [[Fort Lauderdale]] for {{cvt|141|mi}}, north for {{cvt|73|mi}}, and then back over a final {{convert|140|mi|adj=on|abbr=off}} leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance was attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel.

One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a [[Martin PBM Mariner|PBM Mariner]] with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion&lt;ref name = &quot;The_Loss_of_Flight_19&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_disappearance_of_flight_19.html |title=The Disappearance of Flight 19 |work=Bermuda-Triangle.Org |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722093758/http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_disappearance_of_flight_19.html |archive-date=22 July 2012 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.

===''Star Tiger'' and ''Star Ariel''===
{{main|BSAA Star Tiger disappearance|BSAA Star Ariel disappearance}}

[[BSAA Star Tiger disappearance|G-AHNP ''Star Tiger'']] disappeared on January 30, 1948, on a flight from the [[Azores]] to Bermuda; [[BSAA Star Ariel disappearance|G-AGRE ''Star Ariel'']] disappeared on January 17, 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Both were [[Avro]] [[Tudor IV]] passenger aircraft operated by [[British South American Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_tudors.html |title=The Tudors |work=Bermuda-Triangle.Org |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723095709/http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_tudors.html |archive-date=23 July 2012 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both planes were operating at the very limits of their range and the slightest error or fault in the equipment could keep them from reaching the small island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;/&gt;

===Douglas DC-3===
{{main|1948 Airborne Transport DC-3 (DST) disappearance}}

On December 28, 1948, a [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft, number [[NC16002 disappearance|NC16002]], disappeared while on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami. No trace of the aircraft, or the 32 people on board, was ever found. A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation found there was insufficient information available on which to determine probable cause of the disappearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviation Safety DC3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avsaf.org/reports/US/1948.12.28_AirborneTransport_DouglasDC-3.pdf#search=%22Airborne%20Transport%2C%20December%2028%2C%201948%2C%20Miami%2C%20Florida%22|title=Airborne Transport, Miami, December 1948|publisher=Aviation Safety|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103193538/http://www.avsaf.org/reports/US/1948.12.28_AirborneTransport_DouglasDC-3.pdf|archivedate=2007-01-03|accessdate=2015-10-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Connemara IV''===
A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September 26, 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer)&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer, 1974&quot;/&gt; that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes. The [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]] shows [[Hurricane Ione]] passing nearby between 14 and 18 September, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;/&gt; In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle, Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J.E. Challenor of Barbados:&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer, 1975&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winer|1975|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On the morning of September 22, ''Connemara IV'' was lying to a heavy mooring in the open [[roadstead]] of [[Carlisle Bay, Barbados|Carlisle Bay]]. Because of the approaching hurricane, the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors. There was little else he could do, as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage. ... In Carlisle Bay, the sea in the wake of [[Hurricane Janet]] was awe-inspiring and dangerous. The owner of ''Connemara IV'' observed that she had disappeared. An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea.}}

===KC-135 Stratotankers===
On August 28, 1963, a pair of [[US Air Force]] [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic 300 miles west of Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|title= 61-0322|id= 19630828-1|accessdate= 2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|title= 61-0319|id= 19630828-0|accessdate= 2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some writers &lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer, 1974&quot;/&gt; say that while the two aircraft did collide there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over {{convert|160|mi|km}} of water.  However, Kusche's research showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report revealed that the debris field defining the second &quot;crash site&quot; was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of [[seaweed]] and [[driftwood]] tangled in an old [[buoy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche, 1975&quot;/&gt;
