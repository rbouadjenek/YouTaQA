'''BeOS''' is an [[operating system]] for [[personal computer]]s first developed by [[Be Inc.]] in 1991. It was first written to run on [[BeBox]] hardware. BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as [[symmetric multiprocessing]] by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, [[preemptive multitasking]] and a [[64-bit]] [[journaling file system]] known as [[Be File System|BFS]]. The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.

The [[application programming interface|API]] was written in [[C++]] for ease of programming. It has partial [[POSIX]] compatibility and access to a [[command-line interface]] through [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], although internally it is not a [[Unix]]-derived operating system.

BeOS used [[Unicode]] as the default encoding in the GUI, though support for input methods such as [[bidirectional text]] input was never realized.

BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform that  could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share, however, and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc. The company was acquired by [[Palm Inc.]] and today BeOS is mainly used and developed by a small population of enthusiasts.

The open-source OS [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], a complete reimplementation of BeOS, is designed to start up where BeOS left off. Beta 1 of Haiku was released in September 2018, six years after Alpha 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Haiku Release 1 Beta 1|date=September 28, 2018|url=https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2018_09_28_haiku_r1_beta1/|work=Haiku-OS.org|volume=|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929134523/https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2018_09_28_haiku_r1_beta1/|archivedate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Initially designed to run on [[AT&amp;T Hobbit]]-based hardware, BeOS was later modified to run on [[PowerPC]]-based processors: first Be's own systems, later [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] and [[Common Hardware Reference Platform]], with the hope that Apple would purchase or license BeOS as a replacement for its aging [[Classic Mac OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149 | title=BeOS @ MaCreate | date=2004-11-24 | author=Tom | accessdate=2006-11-16 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324220739/http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node%2Fview%2F149 | archivedate=2005-03-24 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] started negotiations to buy Be Inc., but negotiations stalled when Be CEO [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] wanted $300 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tom|first1=Hormby|title=The Rise and Fall of Apple’s Gil Amelio|url=http://lowendmac.com/2013/the-rise-and-fall-of-apples-gil-amelio/|website=Low End Mac|publisher=Cobweb Publishing, Inc.|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple was unwilling to offer any more than $125 million. Apple's board of directors decided [[NeXTSTEP]] was a better choice and purchased [[NeXT]] in 1996 for $429 million, bringing back Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml |title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows NT On The Mac Instead Of OS X! |author=Owen W.

In 1997, [[Power Computing]] began bundling BeOS (on a CD for optional installation) with its line of PowerPC-based [[Macintosh clone]]s. These systems could [[dual boot]] either the [[Classic Mac OS]] or BeOS, with a start-up screen offering the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue1-36.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 1: 1995-1996 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=1996 |website=HaikuOS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217020944/http://haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue1-36.html |archivedate=2010-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Apple's moves and the mounting debt of Be Inc., BeOS was soon ported to the [[X86 architecture|Intel x86]] platform with its R3 release in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue3-24.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 3: 1998 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=1998 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722115320/http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue3-24.html |archivedate=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the late 1990s, BeOS managed to create a niche of followers, but the company failed to remain viable.  Be Inc. also released a stripped-down, but free, copy of [[BeOS R5]] known as BeOS Personal Edition (BeOS PE). BeOS PE could be started from within [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Linux]], and was intended to nurture consumer interest in its product and give developers something to tinker with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-13.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 5: 2000 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2000 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217034633/http://haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-13.html |archivedate=2010-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yellowbites.com/beos.html |title=BeOS/Zeta |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=YellowBites |publisher=YellowBites |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127165851/http://yellowbites.com/beos.html |archivedate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Be Inc. also released a stripped-down version of BeOS for Internet Appliances ([[BeIA]]), which soon became the company's business focus in place of BeOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-17.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 5: 2000 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2000 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722101638/http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-17.html |archivedate=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Be's copyrights were sold to [[Palm, Inc.]] for some $11 million. BeOS R5 is considered the last official version, but BeOS R5.1 &quot;[[Dano (BeOS)|Dano]]&quot;, which was under development before Be's sale to Palm and included the [[BeOS Networking Environment]] (BONE) networking stack, was leaked to the public shortly after the company's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-5.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 5 : 2000 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2000 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722105220/http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-5.html |archivedate=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/552/More-Information-on-the-BeOS-Dano-Version |title=More Information on the BeOS Dano Version |author=Jake Daniels |date=23 January 2001 |website=OSNews |publisher=OSNews |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314090430/http://www.osnews.com/story/552/More-Information-on-the-BeOS-Dano-Version |archivedate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Be Inc. sued [[Microsoft]] claiming that [[Hitachi]] had been dissuaded from selling PCs loaded with BeOS, and that [[Compaq]] had been pressured not to market an Internet appliance in partnership with Be. Be also claimed that Microsoft acted to artificially depress Be Inc.'s [[initial public offering]] (IPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/ | title=Be Inc. sues Microsoft | date=2002-02-20 | author=Andrew Orlowski| accessdate=2008-04-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420193929/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/| archivedate= 20 April 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually settled out of court for $23.25 million with no admission of liability on Microsoft's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/print.php/3073811/ | title=Microsoft Settles Anti-Trust Charges with Be | date=2003-09-08 | author=Mark Berniker| accessdate=2008-04-24| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109045719/http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/print.php/3073811/| archivedate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the split from Palm, [[PalmSource]] used parts of BeOS's multimedia framework for its failed [[Palm OS#Palm OS Cobalt|Palm OS Cobalt]] product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-company.com/news/press/PalmSource/2004/021004_cobalt.html PalmSource Introduces Palm OS Cobalt], PalmSource press release, 10 February 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721033812/http://www.access-company.com/news/press/PalmSource/2004/021004_cobalt.html |date=July 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the takeover of PalmSource, the BeOS rights now belong to [[Access Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmsource.com/press/2005/111405_access.html ACCESS Completes Acquisition of PalmSource], ACCESS press release, November 14, 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105165010/http://www.palmsource.com/press/2005/111405_access.html |date=January 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuation and clones ===
In the years that followed the demise of Be Inc. a handful of projects formed to recreate BeOS or key elements of the OS with the eventual goal of then continuing where Be Inc. left off.  This was facilitated by the fact that Be Inc. released some components of BeOS under a free licence.  Here is a list of these projects:
* BlueEyedOS: It uses a modified version of the Linux kernel and reimplements the BeOS API over it (BeOS applications need to be recompiled).  It is freely downloadable, but sources were never published.  There have been no releases since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueeyedos.com/ |title=Welcome to BlueEyedOS |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 June 2003 |website=BlueEyedOS |publisher=BlueEyedOS |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407132603/http://www.blueeyedos.com/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cosmoe: A port of the Haiku userland over a Linux kernel. BeOS applications need to be recompiled.  It is free and open source software.  The last release was in 2004 and its website is no longer online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmoe.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602144005/http://www.cosmoe.com/ |archivedate=2011-06-02 |title=The Cosmoe Operating System |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2 June 2011 |website=Internet Archive |publisher=Cosmoe |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* E/OS: short for Emulator Operating System.  A Linux and [[FreeBSD]]-based operating system that aimed to run [[Windows]], [[DOS]], [[AmigaOS]] and BeOS applications.  It is free and open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreecountry.com/operating-systems/beos.shtml |title=Free BeOS and BeOS Clones |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 November 2009 |website=The Free Country |publisher=The Free Country |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active development ended in July 2008.
* [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]]: A complete reimplementation of BeOS not based on Linux.  Unlike Cosmoe and BlueEyedOS, it is directly compatible with BeOS applications.  It is free and open source software.  The first alpha release, &quot;Haiku R1 / Alpha 1&quot;, was released on September 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2009-09-13_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_1|title=Haiku Project Announces Availability of Haiku R1/Alpha 1|date=2009-09-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221080301/https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2009-09-13_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_1|archivedate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second alpha release, &quot;Haiku R1 / Alpha 2&quot;, was made available on May 9, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2010-05-10_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_2|title=Haiku Project Announces Availability of Haiku R1/Alpha 2|date=2010-05-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314090249/http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2010-05-10_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_2|archivedate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third alpha release, &quot;Haiku R1 / Alpha 3&quot;, on June 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2011-06-18_haiku_release_1_alpha_3 |title=Haiku Release 1 Alpha 3 |date=June 18, 2011 |work=Haiku-OS.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623133528/http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2011-06-18_haiku_release_1_alpha_3 |archivedate=2011-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Haiku R1 / Alpha 4&quot; was released November 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2012-11-12_haiku_release_1_alpha_4 |title=Haiku Release 1 Alpha 4|date=November 12, 2011| work=Haiku-OS.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222225116/https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2012-11-12_haiku_release_1_alpha_4|archivedate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, it is the only BeOS clone still under development, with the first Beta version released on September 28, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[Magnussoft ZETA|Zeta]] was a commercially available operating system based on the BeOS R5.1 codebase. Originally developed by [[yellowTAB]], the operating system was then distributed by [[magnussoft]]. During development by yellowTAB, the company received criticism from the BeOS community for refusing to discuss its legal position with regard to the BeOS codebase (perhaps for contractual reasons). [[Access Co.]] (which bought [[PalmSource]], until then the holder of the intellectual property associated with BeOS) has since declared that yellowTAB had no right to distribute a modified version of BeOS, and magnussoft has ceased distribution of the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/bs-zeta.htm |title=Zeta Operating System |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 October 2013 |website=Operating System.org |publisher=Operating System.org |accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314085635/http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/bs-zeta.htm |archivedate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
