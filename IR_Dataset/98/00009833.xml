The '''Eureka Rebellion''' was a [[rebellion]] in 1854, instigated by gold [[miner]]s in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], who revolted against the colonial authority of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. It culminated in the '''Battle of the Eureka Stockade''', which was fought between miners and the [[colonial forces of Australia]] on 3 December 1854 at [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka Lead]] and named for the [[stockade]] structure built by miners during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | publisher=New Holand | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people, the majority of whom were rebels.

The rebellion was the culmination of a period of [[civil disobedience]] in the Ballarat region during the [[Victorian gold rush]] with miners objecting to the expense of a [[miner's licence]], taxation via the licence without representation, and the actions of the government, the police and military.&lt;ref name=licence&gt;&quot;The government was forced to  abandon the [[Miner's Licence|licence]] substitute it with a cheaper [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] which also conferred on men the right to vote&quot; The ''Victorians: Arriving''; Richard Broome, 1984. P.92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Withers, WB History of Ballarat and some Ballarat Reminiscences, Facsimile Edition Published by Ballarat Heritage Services 1999, First Published 1800, Pp 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; The local rebellion grew from a [[Ballarat Reform League]] movement and culminated in the erection by the rebels of a crude battlement and a swift and deadly siege by colonial forces.

Mass public support for the captured rebels in the colony's capital of Melbourne when they were placed on trial resulted in the introduction of the [[Electoral Act 1856]], which mandated [[suffrage]] for male colonists in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|lower house in the Victorian parliament]]. This is considered the second instituted act of political democracy in Australia.&lt;ref name=licence/&gt; Female colonists of South Australia were awarded suffrage 5 years later on condition of owning property, much in the way men did not have full suffrage in the absence of property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/education/teachers/Documents/Women's%20Petition%20Photograph.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329160732/http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/education/teachers/Documents/Women%27s%20Petition%20Photograph.pdf |date=29 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eureka Rebellion is controversially identified with the birth of democracy in Australia and interpreted by many as a political revolt.&lt;ref&gt;'Dr. H.V. Evatt, leader of the ALP, wrote that &quot;The Eureka Stockade was of crucial importance in the making of Australian democracy&quot;; Robert Menzies, later Liberal Prime Minister, said that &quot;the Eureka revolution was an earnest attempt at democratic government&quot;; Ben Chifley, former ALP Prime Minister, wrote that &quot;Eureka was more than an incident or passing phase. It was greater in significance than the short-lived revolt against tyrannical authority would suggest. The permanency of Eureka in its impact on our development was that it was the first real affirmation of our determination to be masters of our own political destiny.&quot; (from {{cite web

In 2015, a report commissioned by the [[City of Ballarat]] found that the most likely site of the rallies which led to the rebellion was 29 St. Paul's Way, [[Bakery Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/3389037/final_r_beeston_-_heritage.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415090156/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/3389037/final_r_beeston_-_heritage.pdf |archive-date=15 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given documentary evidence and its elevation, this was likely to be the site where speeches were made and the [[Eureka Flag]] was symbolically hoisted for the first time.

The precise site of the Stockade itself remains unknown&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170831102117/https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/4868456/the-uprising-that-shaped-a-nations-history/]&lt;/ref&gt;, but William Bramwell Withers described its location in 1870:
'It was an area of about an acre, rudely enclosed with slabs, and situated at the point where the Eureka Lead took its bend by the old Melbourne road, now called Eureka Street ... The Site ... lay about midway between what are now Stawell and Queen streets on the east and west, and close to Eureka Street on the south.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekapedia.org/Eureka_Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Protests on the Goldfields: 1851–1854 ===
[[File:Forest Creek Monster Meeting.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Forest Creek Monster Meeting]] of December 1851]]
[[Thomas Hiscock|Hiscock's gold rush]] began on 12 August 1851 following the publication in the ''[[Geelong Advertiser]]'' of Thomas Hiscock's gold findings at Hiscock's, 3 kilometres west of [[Buninyong]] (now [[Magpie, Victoria|Magpie]], approximately 10 kilometres south of Eureka).  Just days later on 16 August 1851, Lieutenant-Governor [[Charles La Trobe|Latrobe]] proclaimed in the Government Gazette crown rights for all mining proceeds and a licence fee of 30 shillings per month effective from 1 September 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf Charles La Trobe, Victoria's Separation &amp; Gold Tax – 'turning a wild colonial country into a civilised one'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411072510/http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf |date=11 April 2013 }} Roy Morgan Research&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August, a rally of 40–50 miners opposing the fee was held at Hiscock's gully – the first of many such protests in the colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argus 30 Aug 1851&quot;&gt;GOLD. Pg 2. The Argus. 30 August 1851&lt;/ref&gt; The miners opposed government policies of oppression including the licence fee, and put forward four resolutions to this effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argus 30 Aug 1851&quot; /&gt; This first meeting was followed by dissent across the colony's mining settlements.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

In December the government announced that it intended to triple the licence fee from £1 to £3 a month, from 1 January 1852.&lt;ref&gt;pg. 24. Bate, Weston. Lucky City&lt;/ref&gt; This move incited protests around the colony, including the Forest Creek Monster Meeting of December 1851. In Ballarat, as historian Weston Bate noted,&lt;ref&gt;Bate, W 1978, ''Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat 1851–1901'', Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; diggers became so agitated that they began to gather arms. The government hastily repealed its plans due to the reaction.

Nevertheless, the oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency causing general dissent among the diggers. In addition, Weston Bate noted that the Ballarat diggings were in strong opposition to the strict liquor licensing laws imposed by the government.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Changes to the Goldfields Act in 1853 allowed licence searches to occur at any time which further incensed the diggers. In [[Bendigo]] in 1853, an [[Anti-Gold Licence Association]] was formed and the miners were apparently on the brink of an armed clash with authorities. Again in 1854, Bendigo miners responded to an increase in the frequency of twice weekly licence hunts with threats of armed rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;pg. 55. Bate, Weston. Lucky City&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder of James Scobie and the burning of Bentley's Hotel ===
{{Main|James Scobie}}
[[File:Doudiet Eureka Riot - Burning of Bentley's Hotel 1854.jpg|thumb|Burning of Bentley's Hotel sketched by [[Charles Doudiet]]]]
On 7 October 1854, Scottish miner James Scobie was murdered at Bentley's Eureka Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/eureka/murder_of_Raz_scobie.htm Murder of James Scobie] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, on 17 October 1854, between 1,000 and 10,000 miners gathered at the hotel to protest the acquittal of James Bentley, the hotel proprietor and prime suspect in Scobie's murder, by an allegedly corrupt magistrate.&lt;ref name=mamscobie&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article202633842 |title=RIOTS AT BALLARAT. |newspaper=[[Mount Alexander Mail]] |issue=26 |location=Victoria|date=27 October 1854 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The miners rioted and Bentley and his wife Catherine fled for their lives as the hotel was burnt down by the angry mob. A small group of soldiers were unable to suppress the riot.&lt;ref name=mamscobie/&gt;

=== Further unrest ===
On 22 October 1854, Ballarat Catholics met to protest the treatment of Father Smyth.&lt;!--need to link or explain this--&gt;
The next day, the arrests of miners McIntyre and Fletcher for the Eureka Hotel fire provoked a mass meeting which attracted 4000 miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13869758|title=Eureka|last=Molony|first=John N.|publisher=Viking|year=1984|isbn=0670800856|location=Ringwood, Victoria|pages=69|oclc=13869758}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting resolved to establish a 'Digger's Rights Society', to protect their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13869758|title=Eureka|last=Molony|first=John N.|publisher=Viking|year=1984|isbn=0670800856|location=Ringwood, Victoria|pages=89|oclc=13869758}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 1854, 10,000 miners met once again at Bakery Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13869758|title=Eureka|last=Molony|first=John N.|publisher=Viking|year=1984|isbn=0670800856|location=Ringwood, Victoria|pages=99|oclc=13869758}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were addressed by Thomas Kennedy, Henry Holyoake, George Black and [[Henry Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13869758|title=Eureka|last=Molony|first=John N.|publisher=Viking|year=1984|isbn=0670800856|location=Ringwood, Victoria|pages=91, 96|oclc=13869758}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diggers were further angered by the arrest of another seven of their number for the Eureka Hotel fire.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

=== Ballarat Reform League ===
{{Main|Ballarat Reform League}}
[[File:Charles Hotham by James Henry Lynch-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Ballarat Reform League sought to negotiate with Commissioner [[Robert William Rede|Robert Rede]] and the [[Governor of Victoria]], [[Charles Hotham|Sir Charles Hotham]] ''(pictured)'']]
On Saturday, 11 November 1854 a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 miners gathered at [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]], directly opposite the government encampment. At this meeting, the Ballarat Reform League was created, under the chairmanship of [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[John Basson Humffray]]. Several other Reform League leaders, including Kennedy and Holyoake, had been involved with the Chartist movement in England. Many of the miners had past involvement in the Chartist movement and the social upheavals in Britain, Ireland, and continental Europe during the 1840s.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

In setting its goals, the Ballarat Reform League  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballarat Reform League Charter|url=//www.amw.org.au/register/listings/ballarat-reform-league-charter|website=Australian Memory of the World Program|publisher=Australian National Commission for UNESCO|accessdate=8 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215194246/http://www.amw.org.au/register/listings/ballarat-reform-league-charter|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the first five of the British Chartist movement's principles as set out in the People's Charter of 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peoples Charter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The People’s Charter 1838 |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/struggle/chartists1/historicalsources/source4/peoplescharter.html |website=The British Library: Learning: History |publisher=London Working Men's Association |accessdate=14 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129020306/http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/struggle/chartists1/historicalsources/source4/peoplescharter.html |archivedate=29 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   They did not adopt or agitate for the Chartist's sixth principle, secret ballots. The meeting passed a resolution &quot;that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called on to obey, that taxation without representation is tyranny.&quot; The meeting also resolved to secede from the United Kingdom if the situation did not improve.&lt;ref name=&quot;macdougal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = MacDougal | first = Ian | year = 2006 | url = http://webdiary.com.au/cms/?q=node/1711 | title = 29 November and the Birth of Australian Democracy | publisher = Webdiary | accessdate = 17 January 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070902094701/http://webdiary.com.au/cms/?q=node%2F1711 | archivedate = 2 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the following weeks, the League sought to negotiate with Commissioner [[Robert William Rede|Robert Rede]] and the [[Governor of Victoria]], [[Charles Hotham|Sir Charles Hotham]], both on the specific matters relating to Bentley and the Scobie's death, and the men being tried for the burning of the Eureka Hotel, and on the broader issues of abolition of the licence, suffrage and democratic representation of the gold fields, and disbanding of the Gold Commission. On 16 November 1854 Governor Hotham appointed a Royal Commission on the goldfields' problems and grievances.  However, Commissioner Rede, rather than hear miners' grievances, increased the police presence in the goldfields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne.  Many historians (most notably [[Manning Clark]]) attribute this to his belief in his right to exert authority over the &quot;rabble.&quot;{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

On 28 November 1854, the reinforcements marching from Melbourne were attacked by a crowd of miners. A number were injured. A rumour of the death of a drummer boy began, and there was even a memorial erected to him in Ballarat Cemetery for many years, although historical research has shown that the boy, John Egan, continued military service until dying in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~garter1/drummerboy.htm Drummer Boy John Egan (Regiment No. 3059) Eureka's first Military Casualty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705144302/http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~garter1/drummerboy.htm |date=5 July 2008 }}. Retrieved 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of about 12,000 'diggers' on the following day, (29 November), the Reform League delegation relayed its failure to achieve any success in negotiations with the authorities. The miners resolved on open resistance to the authorities and to burn the hated licences.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Rede responded by ordering police to conduct a licence search on 30 November. Eight defaulters were arrested, and most of the military resources available had to be summoned to extricate the arresting officers from the [[angry mob]] that had assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/documents.htm?id=7300&amp;subpage=1 | title = Rede's account of the Gravel Pits riots and call for Martial Law to be proclaimed | work = Eureka on Trial | publisher = Public record Office of Victoria | accessdate = 20 February 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409144535/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/documents.htm?id=7300&amp;subpage=1 | archivedate = 9 April 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This raid prompted a change in the leadership of the Reform League, to people who argued in favour of 'physical force' rather than the 'moral force' championed by Humffray and the old leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takver.com/history/eureka.htm#aa522 Reclaiming the Radical Spirit of the Eureka Rebellion in 1854] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027054900/http://www.takver.com/history/eureka.htm |date=27 October 2011 }}.

[[File:Eureka Flag.svg|thumb|right|Modern version of the Eureka Flag]]
In the rising tide of anger and resentment amongst the miners, a more militant leader, [[Peter Lalor]], was elected. In swift fashion, a military structure was assembled. Brigades were formed, and captains were appointed. Licences were burnt, and on 1 December at Bakery Hill, &quot;The disaffected miners... held a meeting where at the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows proffered for its defence.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Three Despatches From Sir Charles Hotham, Public Record Office, Melbourne, (1981?).&lt;/ref&gt; with the 'Eureka oath' being sworn by Peter Lalor to the affirmation of his fellow demonstrators, who encamped themselves around the flag to resist further licence hunts and harassment by the authorities: &quot;We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/escalating_tensions.htm#3 | title = Escalating Tensions: The Southern Cross | work = Eureka on Trial | publisher = Public record Office of Victoria | accessdate = 20 February 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409002333/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/escalating_tensions.htm#3 | archivedate = 9 April 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white and blue Eureka Flag, said to be designed by a Canadian miner, Captain [[Henry Ross]], and bearing nothing but the [[Crux|Southern Cross]], was then flown for the first (recorded) occasion; according to ''The Ballarat Times'', which first mentioned the flag a week earlier on 24 November 1854, at &quot;about eleven o'clock the 'Southern Cross' was hoisted, and its maiden appearance was a fascinating object to behold.&quot; The flag was believed to have been sewn by Anastasia Hayes. Reportedly influenced by earlier designs such as the [[Australian Federation Flag]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Christian Vaughan|url=http://www.australianflag.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ANFA-Newsletter-2009-Comp.pdf |title=Flags under the Southern Cross and the Eureka myth |work=Australian National Flag Association Newsletter|date=August 2009|accessdate=9 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010212852/http://www.australianflag.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ANFA-Newsletter-2009-Comp.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a gesture of defiance {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, it deliberately excluded the British [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]], which is included in the official [[flag of Australia]]. The Eureka flag was commonly referred to at the time as the Australian flag, and as the Southern Cross, with ''The Age'' variously reporting, on 28 November: &quot;The Australian flag shall triumphantly wave in the sunshine of its own blue and peerless sky, over thousands of Australia's adopted sons&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''Ballarat Times'', cited in ''The Age'', 28 November 1854, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; the day after the battle: &quot;They assembled round the Australian flag, which has now a permanent flag-staff&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'', 4 December 1854, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1855 Eureka trials, that it was sworn that the Eureka flag was also known as the &quot;digger's flag&quot; and also as &quot;the Southern Cross&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'', 24 February 1855, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Argus'' newspaper of 4 December 1854 reported that the Union Jack &quot;had&quot; to be hoisted underneath the Eureka flag at the stockade, and that both flags were by then in the possession of the foot police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/eureka_stockade |title=ergo &amp;#124; Research, resources and essay writing |publisher=Slv.vic.gov.au |accessdate=29 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328133926/http://www2.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/eureka_stockade |archivedate=28 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Revolt at Eureka&quot;, ''Pictorial Social Studies'', Vol 16, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Some have questioned whether this sole contemporaneous report of the otherwise unaccounted for Union Jack being present is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clark.

Gregory Black, military historian and author of ''Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle'', concedes two flags may have been flown on the day of the battle, as the miners were claiming to be defending their British rights, with a further article in ''The Argus'' on 9 December 1854, reporting that Constable Hugh King had found a Union Jack like flag being carried by a prisoner;&lt;ref&gt;According to Constable Hugh King's testimony: &quot;...three or four hundred yards a heavy fire from the stockade was opened on the troops and me. When the fire was opened on us we received orders to fire. I saw some of the 40th wounded lying on the ground but I cannot say that it was before the fire on both sides. I think some of the men in the stockade should-they had a flag flying in the stockade; it was a white cross of five stars on a blue ground. – flag was afterwards taken from one of the prisoners like a union jack – we fired and advanced on the stockade, when we jumped over, we were ordered to take all we could prisoners...&quot; mos&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to ''The Eureka Encyclopedia'', Sergeant John McNeil at the time shredded a flag at the Spencer Street Barracks in Melbourne, which was said to be the Eureka flag, but which may well have been a Union Jack.

It is certain that Irish-born people were strongly represented at the Eureka Stockade.&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Curry, 'The Irish at Eureka', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Eureka historians have discovered that as well as comprising most of the miners inside the stockade at the finish, the area where the defensive position was established was overwhelmingly populated by the Irish to begin with.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lateline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s290806.htm |title=Lateline – 7/5/2001: Historians discuss Eureka legend.

====Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind====
During 2 December, the peak rebel force trained in and around the stockade. A further two hundred Americans, the Independent Californian Rangers, under the leadership of James McGill, arrived about 4pm. The Americans were armed with revolvers and Mexican knives and possessed horses. In a fateful decision, McGill decided to take most of the Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements coming from Melbourne. Rede's spies observed these actions. That night many of the miners went back to their own tents after the traditional Saturday night carousing, with the assumption that the Queen's military forces would not be sent to attack on the Sabbath (Sunday). A small contingent of miners remained at the stockade overnight, which the spies reported to Rede.

=== Stockade ===
The stockade itself was a ramshackle affair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benwell|first=Phillip|title=EUREKA|url=http://www.monarchist.org.au/articlesarchive_detail.html?_SKU=12154821304659065&amp;startat=26&amp;index_no=26|publisher=The Australian Monarchist League Inc|accessdate=15 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508155623/http://www.monarchist.org.au/articlesarchive_detail.html?_SKU=12154821304659065&amp;startat=26&amp;index_no=26|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was hastily constructed over the following days from timber and overturned carts. The structure was never meant to be a military stockade or fortress. In the words of Lalor: &quot;it was nothing more than an enclosure to keep our own men together, and was never erected with an eye to military defence&quot;. Lalor had already outlined a plan whereby, &quot;if the government forces come to attack us, we should meet them on the Gravel Pits, and if compelled, we should retreat by the heights to the old Canadian Gully, and there we shall make our final stand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eureka Stockade history, Part 2: Peter Lalor's Statement in The Argus of 10 April 1855|url=http://home.alphalink.com.au/~eureka/lalor.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401185811/http://home.alphalink.com.au/~eureka/lalor.htm|archivedate=1 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siege of the Eureka Stockade ===
[[File:Map of Eureka Stockade 1854 Updated.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the stockade and opposing forces]]
By the beginning of December, the police contingent at Ballarat had been joined and surpassed in number by soldiers from British Army garrisons in Victoria, including detachments from the [[Suffolk Regiment|12th (East Suffolk) Regiment of Foot]] and [[40th Regiment of Foot|40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4800939 |title=SERIOUS RIOT AT BALLAARAT. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=2357 |location=Melbourne|date=28 November 1854 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 3&amp;nbsp;am on Sunday, 3 December, a party of 276 soldiers and police, under the command of Captain [[John Wellesley Thomas|John W.

[[File:Eureka stockade.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Eureka Stockade]]
There is no agreement as to which side fired first, but the battle was fierce, brief, and terribly one-sided. The ramshackle army of miners was hopelessly outclassed by a military regiment and was routed in about 10 minutes. During the height of the battle, Lalor was shot in his left arm, took refuge under some timber and was smuggled out of the stockade and hidden. His arm was later amputated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lalor-peter-3980|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Ian|last=Turner|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=14 August 2017|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802214440/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lalor-peter-3980|archivedate=2 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories tell how women ran forward and threw themselves over the injured to prevent further indiscriminate killing. The Commission of Inquiry would later say that it was &quot;a needless as well as a ruthless sacrifice of human life indiscriminate of innocent or guilty, and after all resistance had disappeared.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
Early in the battle &quot;Captain&quot; Henry Ross was shot dead.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

According to Lalor's report, fourteen miners (mostly Irish) died inside the stockade and an additional eight died later from injuries they sustained. A further dozen were wounded but recovered. Three months after the Eureka Stockade, Peter Lalor wrote: &quot;As the inhuman brutalities practised by the troops are so well known, it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. There were 34 digger casualties of which 22 died. The unusual proportion of the killed to the wounded, is owing to the butchery of the military and troopers after the surrender.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Toscano, ''[http://www.takver.com/history/eureka.htm#aa502 The Killing Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027054900/http://www.takver.com/history/eureka.htm |date=27 October 2011 }}'' Reclaiming the Radical Spirit of the Eureka Rebellion in 1854, (2004) Accessed 20 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the battle, trooper [[John King (Eureka)|John King]] the police constable, took down the Eureka flag. By 8&amp;nbsp;am, Captain [[Charles Pasley (engineer)|Charles Pasley]], the second in command of the British forces, sickened by the carnage, saved a group of prisoners from being bayoneted and threatened to shoot any police or soldiers who continued with the slaughter.

One hundred and fourteen diggers, some wounded, were marched off to the Government camp about two kilometres away, where they were kept in an overcrowded lock-up, before being moved to a more spacious barn on Monday morning.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

====Estimates of the death toll====
Of the soldiers and police, six were killed, including Captain Wise. [[Martial law]] was imposed, and all armed resistance collapsed. News of the battle spread quickly to Melbourne and other gold field regions, turning a perceived Government military victory in repressing a minor insurrection into a public relations disaster. Thousands of people in Melbourne turned out to condemn the authorities, in defiance of their mayor and some Legislative Councillors, who tried to rally support for the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ballaratreformleague1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston Bate|url=http://www.ballaratreformleague.org.au/ballarat.htm |title=The Eureka Stockade: Gateway to Democracy |accessdate=13 September 2011 |website=Ballarat Reform League|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909231820/http://www.ballaratreformleague.org.au/ballarat.htm |archivedate=9 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ballarat, only one man responded to the call for special constables,&lt;ref name=&quot;ballaratreformleague1&quot;/&gt; although in Melbourne 1500 were sworn in and armed with batons.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Proctor: Convict, Pioneer and Settler By Jeff Atkinson&lt;/ref&gt; Many people voiced their support for the diggers' requested reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2010/08/10/the-eureka-rebellion-of-1854-by-eric-petersen-2/|title=The Eureka Rebellion of 1854 by Eric Petersen|date=2010-08-10|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact numbers of deaths and injuries and persons are difficult to determine as many miners &quot;fled to the surrounding bush and it is likely a good many more died a lonely death or suffered the agony of their wounds, hidden from the authorities for fear of repercussions.&quot; according to Eureka researcher and author Dr Dorothy Wickham. The official register of deaths in the Ballarat District Register shows 27 names associated with the stockade battle at Eureka.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Wickham, ''[http://www.ballaratgenealogy.org.au/art/eureka-d.htm Deaths at Eureka] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124201521/http://www.ballaratgenealogy.org.au/art/eureka-d.htm |date=24 January 2014 }}'' an extract from her book &quot;Deaths at Eureka&quot;, 64pp, 1996 {{ISBN|0-646-30283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Clare Wright]] quotes one source, Thomas Pierson, who noted in the margin to his diary ''time has proved that near 60 have died of the diggers in all''. According to Wright, Captain Thomas estimated that 30 diggers died on the spot and ''many more died of their wounds subsequently.'' Even the ''Geelong Advertiser'' on 8 December 1854 stated that deaths were &quot;more numerous than originally supposed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright, Clare 2013 pp 428&quot;/&gt;

While it has been thought all the deaths at Eureka were men, research by historian Clare Wright details that at least one woman lost her life in the massacre. Wright's research details the important role of women on the goldfields and in the reform movement. Her book ''Forgotten Rebels of Eureka'' details how Charles Evans' diary describes a funeral for a woman who was mercilessly butchered by a mounted trooper while pleading for the life of her husband during the Eureka massacre. Her name and the fate and identity of her husband remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Clare, ''The Forgotten Rebels of Eureka'' (2013) Text Publishing, Melbourne {{ISBN|9781922147370}}, pp 429&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] has commented, &quot;Every government in the world would probably have counter-attacked in the face of the building of the stockade.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=Introduction|journal=Journal of Australian Colonial History|date=2008|volume=10|issue=1|page=10|url=http://search.informit.com.au.rp.nla.gov.au/fullText;dn=443514335881965;res=IELHSS|accessdate=21 January 2017|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a few weeks it appeared that the status quo had been restored, and Rede ruled the camps with an iron fist.&lt;!--REMOVED SENTENCE(S) TAGGED WITHOUT A CITATION-- However, in Melbourne and much of rural Victoria, and to a lesser extent the other Australian colonies, there was tremendous public outcry over the military actions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Newspapers characterised it as a brutal overuse of force{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}in a situation brought about by the actions of government officials in the first place, and public condemnation became insurmountable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}--&gt;

=== Trials for sedition and high treason ===
[[File:Trial of Eureka Rebels.jpg|thumb|Engraving published in ''The Age'' of some of the rebels on trial]]
The first trial relating to the rebellion was a charge of [[Australian sedition law|sedition]] against [[Henry Seekamp]] of the ''Ballarat Times''. Seekamp was arrested in his newspaper office on 4 December 1854, for a series of articles that appeared in the ''Ballarat Times''. Many of these articles were written by George Lang, the son of the prominent republican and Presbyterian Minister of Sydney, the Reverend [[John Dunmore Lang]]. He was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, precisely three months early. While he was in jail, Henry Seekamp's de facto wife, [[Clara Seekamp]] took over the business, and became the first female editor of an Australian newspaper.

Of the approximately 120 'diggers' detained after the rebellion, thirteen were brought to trial. They were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/state_treason_trials.htm | title = The State Trials | work = Eureka on Trial | publisher = Public record Office of Victoria | accessdate = 19 February 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409120724/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/state_treason_trials.htm | archivedate = 9 April 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trial started on 22 February 1855, with defendants being brought before the court on charges of high treason. Joseph was one of three Americans arrested at the stockade, with the United States  Consul intervening for the release of the other two Americans. The prosecution was handled by [[Attorney-General of Victoria|Attorney-General]] [[William Stawell]] representing the Crown&lt;ref&gt;

The jury deliberated for about half an hour before returning a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. &quot;A sudden burst of applause arose in the court&quot; reported ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', but was instantly checked by court officers. The Chief Justice condemned this as an attempt to influence the jury, as it could be construed that a jury could be encouraged to deliver a verdict that would receive such applause; he sentenced two men (identified by the Crown Solicitor as having applauded) to a week in prison for contempt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Argus'', 24 February 1885 &lt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page186129&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Over 10,000 people had come to hear the jury's verdict.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} John Joseph was carried around the streets of Melbourne in a chair in triumph, according to the Ballarat newspaper ''[[The Ballarat Star|The Star]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Commission of Enquiry ===
When Hotham's Royal Commission report, initiated before the conflict, was finally handed down it was scathing in its assessment of all aspects of the administration of the gold fields, and particularly the Eureka Stockade affair. According to Blainey, &quot;It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.&quot;

The report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The [[Miner's Licence|gold licences]] were then abolished, and replaced by an annual [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields. Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted. Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.

=== Peter Lalor ===

Following the battle, rebel leader, [[Irish Australian]] Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, &quot;There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lalor stood for [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|{{Notatypo|Ballaarat}}]] in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.

During a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, &quot;I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.&quot;

==Political legacy==
The actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]]. In his 1897 travel book ''[[Following the Equator]]'', American writer [[Mark Twain]] wrote of the Eureka Rebellion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some historians believe that the prominence of the event in the public record has come about because Australian history does not include a major armed rebellion phase equivalent to the [[French Revolution]], the [[English Civil War]], or the [[American War of Independence]], making the Eureka story inflated well beyond its real significance. Others, however, maintain that Eureka was a seminal event and that it marked a major change in the course of Australian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s290806.htm |title=Lateline – 7/5/2001: Historians discuss Eureka legend .

In 1980, historian Geoffrey Blainey drew attention to the fact that many miners were temporary migrants from Britain and the United States, who did not intend to settle permanently in Australia. He wrote:
{{quote|Nowadays it is common to see the noble [[Eureka Flag|Eureka flag]] and the rebellion of 1854 as the symbol of Australian independence, of freedom from foreign domination; but many saw the rebellion in 1854 as an uprising by outsiders who were exploiting the country's resources and refusing to pay their fair share of taxes. So we make history do its handsprings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''A Land Half Won'', Melbourne: Sun Books, 1983 (first printed in 1980), {{ISBN|0-7251-0411-2}}, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Eureka Rebellion Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Eureka, Victoria#Eureka Stockade Memorials|Eureka Monument]] in Ballarat, erected in 1884]]
The materials used to build the stockade were rapidly removed to be used for the mines, and the entire area around the site was so extensively worked that the original landscape became unrecognisable, so identifying the exact location of the stockade is now virtually impossible.

A diggers' memorial was erected in the Ballarat Cemetery on 22 March 1856 near marked graves. Sculpted in stone from the [[Barrabool Hills]] by James Leggatt in Geelong it features a pillar bearing the names of the deceased miners and bearing the inscription &quot;Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3rd of December, 1854, in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government.&quot;

A soldiers' memorial was erected many years later in 1876 and is an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from [[Waurn Ponds]] with the words &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Duty&quot; carved in its north and south faces respectively. In 1879 a cast iron fence was added to the memorials and graves.

Over the next thirty years, press interest in the events that had taken place at the Eureka Stockade dwindled, but Eureka was kept alive at the campfires and in the pubs, and in memorial events in Ballarat. In addition, key figures such as Lalor and Humfray were still in the public eye.

Eureka had not been forgotten: it was readily remembered.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Similar flags have been flown at rebellions since including a flag similar {{Clarify|date=September 2010}} to the Eureka flag which was flown above the [[Barcaldine, Queensland|Barcaldine]] strike camp in the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1889, Melbourne businessmen employed renowned American [[cyclorama]] artist [[Thaddeus Welch]], who teamed up with local artist Izett Watson to paint {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}} of canvas of the Eureka Stockade, wrapped around a wooden structure. When it opened in Melbourne, the exhibition was an instant hit. ''The Age'' reported in 1891 that &quot;it afforded a very good opportunity for people to see what it might have been like at Eureka&quot;. ''The Australasian'' wrote &quot;that many persons familiar with the incidents depicted, were able to testify to the fidelity of the painted scene&quot;. The people of Melbourne flocked to the cyclorama, paid up and had their picture taken before it. It was eventually dismantled and disappeared from sight.

The site of the Eureka Stockade in [[Ballarat]] is currently being redeveloped with the support of grants from the City of Ballarat and the Victorian and Federal Governments. It will feature the new [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] (M.A.D.E) that will draw on the touchstone of Eureka and its newly restored flag, and put the Eureka Stockade into the context of 260 years of democracy.

M.A.D.E.'s highly interactive exhibition, based on the premise of ''People + Power = Democracy'',  is expected to open in early 2013, followed by a national rollout of public onsite and online programs.

Deputy Premier, the Hon. Peter Ryan, told the Legislative Assembly, sitting in Ballarat in 2012, that M.A.D.E. would be &quot;a magnificent tribute to the events&quot; of the Eureka Stockade.

The Museum's ''M.A.D.E. You Look'' booklet says M.A.D.E will be 'an online platform and immersive museum with a refreshing approach to culture, civics, history and citizenship. M.A.D.E puts the past into a contemporary context, celebrates Australia's achievements and inspires new ways of thinking about issues like equality, freedom of speech, parliamentary representation and the rule of law'. The museum 'will ignite debate about what it means to be an effective Australian in the 21st Century'.

''[[Eureka Stockade (1907 film)|Eureka Stockade]]'' (1907), directed by Arthur and [[George Cornwell]] and produced by the Australasian Cinematograph Company, was the second feature film made in Australia (the first being the 1906 production, ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]''). The film was first screened on 19 October 1907 at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum]]. The film impressed critics of the time and was found to be a stirring portrayal of the events surrounding the Eureka Stockade, but failed to connect with audiences during the two weeks it was screened. The surviving seven-minute fragment (stored at the [[National Film and Sound Archive]]) shows street scenes of Ballarat. Other scenes in the lost reels of the film were believed to have included gold seekers leaving London, issuing of licences, licence hunting, diggers chained to logs and rescued by mates, diggers burning Bentley's Hotel, the Rebellion, building the stockade, troops storming the stockade and the stockade in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The accounts of these eyewitnesses are the main source for the monologues directly aimed at the audience, and, as the caption at the start of the film says: &quot;the lines spoken by actors in this film are the documented words of the historical characters.&quot;
The cast also included [[Julia Zemiro]] as Celeste de Chabrillan and Andrew Larkins as Peter Lalor.
It was filmed in Ballarat and ''Toorac House'' in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4/ ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' at IMDb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406233127/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4%2F |date=6 April 2015 }} &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parham-media.com/docos/riotorr/ror_notes.htm/ ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' cast and notes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906051907/http://www.parham-media.com/docos/riotorr/ror_notes.htm/ |date=6 September 2014 }} at IMDb &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
