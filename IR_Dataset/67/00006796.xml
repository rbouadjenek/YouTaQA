'''Ceres Brewery''' was a [[brewery]] company located in [[Århus]], [[Denmark]]. It was part of [[Royal Unibrew]] since 1989. The factories in central Aarhus, was closed in 2008 and the grounds are now being redeveloped into a new neighbourhood of the city, known as [[CeresByen]] (The CeresCity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessaarhus.dk/en/Fremtidens-Aarhus/Udviklingsomraader/Ceres-grunden.aspx The CeresCity] Business Aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;
Ceres made several popular beers and sodas, that still exists today, now being produced by Royal Unibrew A/S.

==History==
[[File:Ceres Grunden.JPG|thumb|left|Construction at the Ceres grounds (2014).]]
Ceres Brewery was founded by a [[grocer]] named [[Malthe Conrad Lottrup]], with help from the [[chemist]]s A. S. Aagard and Knud Redelien, as the city's seventh brewery. It was named after the [[Rome|Roman]] goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and its opening was announced in the local newspaper, ''[[Århus Stiftstidende|Stiftstidende]]'', in 1856.

The brewery was successful, and Lottrup became one of the most prominent people of Aarhus. After ten years, he expanded the brewery, adding a grand new building as his own private residence, where he entertained other local figures.

Lottrup's son-in-law, [[Laurits Christian Meulengracht]], took over the running of the brewery after that, and was in charge for nearly thirty years, expanding it further. He then sold it to another brewery, [[Østjyske Bryggerier A/S]].

The brewery gained more esteem in 1914, when it was made &quot;Purveyor to the Royal Danish Court&quot;.

In 2008 the factory closed because the brewery could not live up to the expectations from its owner Royal Unibrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tv2oj.dk/artikel/16464 | title = Nu er det officielt: Ceres lukker | publisher = Tv2oj (Danish) | accessdate = 2008-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
