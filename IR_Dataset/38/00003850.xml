'''Baseball''' is a [[bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball game]] played between two opposing teams who take turns [[batting (baseball)|batting]] and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the [[fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]], called the [[pitcher]], throws a ball which a player on the [[batting team (baseball)|batting team]] tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team ([[Batting team (baseball)|batting team]]) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called &quot;[[Run (baseball)|runs]]&quot;. The objective of the defensive team ([[Fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]]) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' [[base running|advance around the bases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Rules of MLB, 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.

The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]]. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called &quot;[[Out (baseball)|out]]&quot; can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners &quot;out&quot;, which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, [[extra innings]] are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.

Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the [[Baseball in the United States|United States]]. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]] and [[Sports in Taiwan#Baseball|Taiwan]].

In the United States and Canada, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League]]s and in Cuba between the [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]], organized by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.

The dimensions given are for professional and professional-style games. Children often play on smaller fields.]]

A baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense ([[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[baserunning]]) and defense ([[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheaders]] in college and minor leagues, and six innings at the Little League level).&lt;ref name=&quot;League&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/|title=Rules, Regulations, and Policies - Little League|last=League|first=Little|work=Little League|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, [[counterclockwise]], from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (2000), p. 15; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|title=Official Rules/Foreword|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124020327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|archivedate=24 January 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.01–1.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/4.00—Starting and Ending a Game (Rule 4.10)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the [[infield]]; the area farther beyond the infield is the [[outfield]]. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.04–1.07)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic tools of baseball: the [[baseball (ball)|ball]], the [[baseball bat|bat]], and the [[baseball glove|glove or mitt]]:
* The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9&amp;nbsp;inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.&lt;ref&gt;Porterfield (2007), p. 23; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.09)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34&amp;nbsp;inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42&amp;nbsp;inches (106 centimeters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.10a)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}} {{cite web|author=Fitzgerald, Stephen|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2005/0176531.html|title=Polymer Composite Baseball Bat Endcap (U.S. Patent Application 20050176531)|date=November 8, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=FreePatentsOnline.com|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.12–1.15)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Protective [[batting helmet|helmets]] are also standard equipment for all batters.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (2000), pp. 21, 30, 31; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.16)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the [[pitcher]], stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another fielding team player, the [[catcher]], squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the [[baseball positions|standard arrangement]], there is a [[first baseman]] positioned several steps to the left of first base, a [[second baseman]] to the right of second base, a [[shortstop]] to the left of second base, and a [[third baseman]] to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are [[left fielder]], [[center fielder]], and [[right fielder]]. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] sets up behind the catcher.&lt;ref&gt;Porterfield (2007), pp. 16–18, 25, 34, 35; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|title=Official Rules/9.00—The Umpire (Rule 9.03a)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011323/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP source: 7 umpires rotate at World Series|newspaper=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=September 29, 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/09/29/ap-source-7-umpires-rotate-at-world-series/16437053/|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a ''runner'' (or, until the play is over, a ''batter-runner''). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being [[putout|put out]] is said to be ''[[safe (baseball)|safe]]'' and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a [[single (baseball)|single]]. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a [[double (baseball)|double]]; third base, a [[triple (baseball)|triple]]. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a [[home run]]: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an [[error (baseball)|error]].&lt;ref name=RulesPuttingBallInPlay/&gt;

Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base ''must'' attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes [[dead ball (baseball)|dead]] and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has [[flyout|flied out]] and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they [[tag up]] (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a [[stolen base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf|title=Official Rules/5.00—Putting the Ball in Play.

A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded [[strikeout|strikes out]]. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a [[base on balls]] or walk, a free advance to first base.

While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the strikeout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the [[flyout]], [[force play|ground out]], [[force play|force out]], and [[tag out]]. It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a [[double play]]. Three outs in one play, a [[triple play]], is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rule 6.05)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011324/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf|title=Official Rules/7.00—The Runner (Rules 7.08, 7.10)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011328/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual player's turn batting or [[plate appearance]] is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (2000), p. 100; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf|title=Official Rules/3.00—Game Preliminaries (Rule 3.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011326/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rules 6.01, 6.04)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011324/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;League&quot;/&gt;

If the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.&lt;ref&gt;Porterfield (2007), p. 19; Thurston (2000), p. 153; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rule 6.10)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011324/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of players on a baseball roster, or ''squad'', varies by [[Baseball league|league]] and by the level of organized play. A [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles. A typical roster features the following players:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|url=http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090404&amp;content_id=4127882&amp;vkey=pr_was&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=was|title=Nationals Finalize 25-Man Roster|date=2009-04-04|accessdate=2009-04-21|publisher=Washington Nationals/Major League Baseball|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104000/http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090404&amp;content_id=4127882&amp;vkey=pr_was&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=was|archivedate=July 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eight [[position player]]s: the [[catcher]], four [[infielder]]s, and three [[outfielder]]s—all of whom play on a regular basis
* Five [[starting pitcher]]s who constitute the team's [[Pitch (baseball)|pitching]] rotation or starting rotation
* Six [[relief pitcher]]s, including one [[closer (baseball)|closer]], who constitute the team's [[bullpen]] (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
* One backup, or substitute, catcher
* Two backup infielders
* Two backup outfielders
* One [[pinch hitter]], or a [[utility player]], or a seventh reliever

The [[manager (baseball)|manager]], or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more [[coach (baseball)|coaches]]; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, whom occupy designated coaches' boxes, just outside the foul lines. These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play.&lt;ref&gt;Walfoort, Cleon, &quot;Most 'Signs' Given by Coaches Are Merely Camouflage&quot;, ''[[Baseball Digest]]'', December 1960 – January 1961, pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Fans Speak Out&quot; [''Baseball Digest'' staff], ''Baseball Digest'', August 1999, pp. 9–10; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf|title=Official Rules/3.00—Game Preliminaries (Rule 3.15)|accessdate=2009-04-27|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520205621/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf|archivedate=May 20, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 293; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|title=Official Rules/9.00—The Umpire|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215915/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategy and tactics ==
{{see also|Baseball positioning}}

Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bast, Andrew|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/146842|title=Southpaw's Revenge|date=July 18, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-08|work=[[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions. The manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Davis, Hank, ''Small-town Heroes: Images of Minor League Baseball'' (Univ. of Iowa Press, 1997), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Pitch (baseball)}}

The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paine|first=Neil|title=Game Theory Says R.A. Dickey Should Throw More Knuckleballs|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=August 13, 2015|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/game-theory-says-r-a-dickey-should-throw-more-knuckleballs/|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter; thus creating differing pitches that can be selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Mechanics Of A Breaking Pitch|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=December 6, 2004|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/sports/a3207/1283161/|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the [[fastball]], the [[changeup]] (or off-speed pitch), and two [[breaking ball]]s—the [[curveball]] and the [[Slider (baseball)|slider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walsh, John|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/fastball-slider-changeup-curveball-an-analysis/|title=Fastball, Slider, Change-up, Curveball—An Analysis|date=December 20, 2007|accessdate=2009-02-21|publisher=[[The Hardball Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may [[Glossary of baseball (S)#shake off|shake off the sign]] and the catcher will call for a different pitch.

With a runner on base and [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lead|taking a lead]], the pitcher may attempt a [[pickoff]], a quick throw to a fielder [[covering a base|covering the base]] to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarver|first1=Tim|last2=Peary|first2=Danny|title=Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans: Understanding and Interpreting the Game So You Can Watch It Like a Pro|publisher=Random House|year=2013|pages=71, 272–273|isbn=9780307831774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a [[balk]] against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balk|publisher=Major League Baseball|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/balk|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an attempted [[stolen base]] is anticipated, the catcher may call for a [[pitchout]], a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), pp. 126–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a [[Glossary of baseball (S)#shift|shift]], with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may [[Glossary of baseball (P)#playing in|play in]], moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a [[Glossary of baseball (G)#ground ball|ground ball]], though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.&lt;ref name=SB45&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Batting and baserunning tactics ===

Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]] is sometimes employed, with a skillful [[contact hitter]], the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), pp. 5, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sacrifice bunt]], calls for the batter to focus on making soft contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into [[scoring position]] as the batter is thrown out at first. A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] for a hit. A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a [[squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze play]].&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), pp. 42–43, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a [[sacrifice fly]].&lt;ref name=SB45/&gt; The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is [[Glossary of baseball (A)#ahead in the count|ahead in the count]] (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to [[Glossary of baseball (T)#take sign|take]], or not swing at, the next pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision.

Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[dead-ball era]] ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the [[spitball]] and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the legendary player [[Babe Ruth]], the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] invested in several [[minor league baseball|minor league clubs]] and developed the first modern [[farm team|farm system]].&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Negro National League (1933–1948)|Negro National League]] was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the [[Negro American League]]. The [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first elections]] to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] took place in 1936. In 1939, [[Little League Baseball]] was founded in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp|title=History of Little League|accessdate=2007-06-26|publisher=Little League|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514082459/http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp|archivedate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was [[Seitz decision|effectively struck down]], leading to the [[free agent|free agency system]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 178, 180, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant work stoppages occurred in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|1981]] and [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994]], the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 184–187, 191, 192, 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simm&quot;&gt;Simmons, Rob, &quot;The Demand for Spectator Sports&quot;, in ''Handbook on the Economics of Sport'', ed.

In 2001, [[Barry Bonds]] established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by [[Banned substances in baseball|the abuse of illegal steroids]] (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271; Zimbalist (2007), pp. 195, 196; {{cite news|author=Verducci, Tom|title=To Cheat or Not to Cheat|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/magazine/05/29/baseball.steroids/index.html|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=May 29, 2012|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing [[Hank Aaron]], as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MajorAtRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Regular-Season Attendance Just Shy of Last Year's Record|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/124427|work=Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Daily|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MinorAtRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Minor League Baseball History|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=2009-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120173052/http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|archivedate=January 20, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinctive elements ==
Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock,&lt;ref&gt;Guttmann (2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; play is less individual,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandelbaum5557&quot;&gt;Mandelbaum (2005), pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; and the variation between playing fields is not as substantial or important.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2007), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[comparison between cricket and baseball]] demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Brancazio|first=Peter J.|title=The Hardest Blow of All|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|date=December 22–29, 1983|pages=880–883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpS_6bpt9KoC&amp;pg=PA880|accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== No clock to kill ===
[[File:A worn-out baseball.JPG|thumb|A well-worn baseball]]
In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead [[stalling (gaming)|killing the clock]] rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Nicholas James, &quot;Team Sports&quot;, in ''Encyclopedia of Time'', ed. Samuel L. Macey (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1994), pp. 588–590: p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, in the case of multi-day [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[first-class cricket]], the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.&lt;ref&gt;Eastaway, Rob, ''What Is a Googly?: The Mysteries of Cricket Explained'' (Anova, 2005), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Bodley, Hal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-02-26-bodley_x.htm|title=Baseball Wants Just a Few More Minutes|date=February 26, 2004|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters).&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Greenfield, Jeff|author-link=Jeff Greenfield|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988721,00.html|title=Midnight Baseball|date=July 13, 1998|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB&quot;/&gt; By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Berg, Ted|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/mlb-games-length-three-hours-pace-of-play|title=Why Are Baseball Games Getting So Much Longer?|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=2014-12-27|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;/&gt; Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/pages/027087.html|title=Japan's Pro Baseball Teams Start Eco-Project to Cut Energy Use by 6%|date=July 13, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=Japan for Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes.

=== Individual focus ===
[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Babe Ruth]] in 1920, the year he joined the [[New York Yankees]]]]
Although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: &quot;the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The [[baseball statistics|statistical precision of baseball]] is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.

Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Richard, &quot;Baseball in England&quot;, ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157–158: &quot;The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniqueness of each baseball park ===

Unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]], is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game. (Rule 1.04a)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=February 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at [[Minute Maid Park]], which became the home of the [[Houston Astros]] in 2000, the [[Crawford Boxes]] in left field are only {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} from home plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nightengale, Bob|date=August 20, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm|title=No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or [[inside-the-park home run]].&lt;ref&gt;Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 198; {{cite news|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=May 27, 2006|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/27/sports/sp-angels27|title=Guerrero Becomes Mr. Inside|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game.

Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=October 8, 2002|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/08/sports/sp-angnote8|title=No Fly Ball Routine in Dome|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude—{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Keri (2007), pp. 295–301.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wrigley Field]], home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&amp;content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&amp;content_id=3575106&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|archivedate=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the [[New York Yankees]], will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
{{Further|Baseball statistics}}

Organized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] of [[Brooklyn]], was responsible for the &quot;development of the [[box score (baseball)|box score]], tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.&quot;&lt;ref name=T16&gt;Tygiel (2000), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical record is so central to the game's &quot;historical essence&quot; that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball.&lt;ref name=T16/&gt; In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian [[Alan Schwarz]] describes as a &quot;tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (2004), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the [[official scorer]] to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The [[baseball scorekeeping|score report]] is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; General managers, managers, and [[scout (sport)|baseball scouts]] use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.

[[File:Baseball steal.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rickey Henderson]]—the major leagues' all-time leader in runs and stolen bases—stealing third base in a 1988 game]]
Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rules 10.02a, 10.04, 10.21b)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[At bat]]s: plate appearances, excluding walks and [[hit by pitch]]es—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners
* Hits: times a base is reached safely, because of a batted, fair ball without a fielding error or [[fielder's choice]]
* Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely
* [[Run batted in|Runs batted in]] (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error
* Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error
* [[Batting average (baseball)|Batting average]]: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting ability
The basic baserunning statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rule 10.07)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball
* Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base
[[File:Cy young pitching.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cy Young]]—the holder of many major league career marks, including wins and innings pitched, as well as losses—in 1908. MLB's annual [[Cy Young Award|awards for the best pitcher in each league]] are named for Young.]]
The basic pitching statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rules 10.15, 10.17, 10.19, 10.21a, 10.21e)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Win–loss record (pitching)|Wins]]: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)
* [[Win–loss record (pitching)|Losses]]: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished
* [[Save (baseball)|Saves]]: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or [[on deck (baseball)|on deck]]; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
* [[Innings pitched]]: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., &quot;5.2&quot; or &quot;7.1&quot;, the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)
* Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter
* [[Winning percentage]]: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)
* [[Earned run average]] (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitched
The basic fielding statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rules 10.09, 10.10, 10.12, 10.21d)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Putout]]s: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out
* [[Assist (baseball)|Assists]]: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball
* [[Error (baseball)|Errors]]: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result
* [[Total chances]]: putouts plus assists plus errors
* [[Fielding average]]: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chances

Among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as ''situational statistics''. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher [[intentional base on balls|intentionally walk]] the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Albert, Jim, and Jay Bennett, &quot;Situational Effects&quot;, ch. 4 in ''Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game'', 2d ed. (Springer, 2003), pp. 71–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabermetrics ===
[[Sabermetrics]] refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, [[Bill James]], and derives from the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR).&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Scott, ''The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outsider Changed Baseball'' (Doubleday, 2006), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo (2007), pp. 20–21, 67; Schwarz (2004), p. 233; Lewis (2003), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[On-base percentage]] measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21f)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Slugging percentage]] measures a batter's ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter's [[total bases]] (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21c)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:
* [[On-base plus slugging]] (OPS) measures a batter's overall ability. It is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo (2007), pp. 22, 67, 140; Schwarz (2004), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched]] (WHIP) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated exactly as its name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo (2007), pp. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1919, philosopher [[Morris Raphael Cohen]] described baseball as America's national religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Morris Raphael, &quot;Baseball as a National Religion&quot; (1919), in Cohen, ''The Faith of a Liberal'' (Transaction, 1993 [1946]), pp. 334–336: p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of sports columnist [[Jayson Stark]], baseball has long been &quot;a unique paragon of American culture&quot;—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stark, Jayson|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&amp;id=3892788|title=A-Rod Has Destroyed Game's History|date=February 8, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-08|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210124048/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&amp;id=3892788|archivedate=February 10, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes &quot;how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of [[San Pedro de Macorís]], has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. 159–165.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country.

The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience.&lt;ref&gt;Riess (1991), pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.&lt;ref&gt;Riess (1991), pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country.&lt;ref name=RW&gt;{{Cite news|author=Whiting, Robert|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2007/04/11/baseball/is-the-mlb-destroying-japans-national-pastime/|title=Is the MLB Destroying Japan's National Pastime?|date=April 11, 2007|accessdate=2009-02-08|work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport,&lt;ref&gt;González Echevarría (2001), pp. 76, 133, 278–279, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;{{cite news|author=Weissert, Will|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2009-03-05-3277668016_x.htm|title=Cubans' Baseball Dreams Take Root on Rocky Fields|date=March 5, 2009|accessdate=2009-04-28|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system.

Baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of [[English language idioms derived from baseball|English-language idioms have been derived from baseball]]; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used [[Baseball metaphors for sex|sexual euphemisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Kte'pi (2009), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the [[1922 World Series]]: famed sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] announced [[play-by-play]] from New York City's [[Polo Grounds]] on [[WABC (AM)#As WJZ|WJZ]]–[[Newark, New Jersey]], which was connected by wire to [[WGY (AM)|WGY]]–[[Schenectady, New York]], and [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]]–[[Springfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudel (2008), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[baseball cap]] has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lam, Andrew|url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Too-much-self-esteem-spoils-your-child-2552521.php|title=Too Much Self Esteem Spoils Your Child|publisher=New America Media|date=July 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-05-02}} {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3660333.stm|title=Happy 50th, Baseball Caps|work=BBC News|date=April 27, 2004|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, [[Ernest Thayer]]'s poem &quot;[[Casey at the Bat]]&quot;, appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a &quot;clutch situation&quot;, the poem became the source of [[vaudeville]] and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many [[baseball movie]]s, including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]–winning ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942) and the Oscar nominees ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984) and ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989). The [[American Film Institute]]'s selection of the ten best sports movies includes ''The Pride of the Yankees'' at number 3 and ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988) at number 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/sports.html|title=AFI 10 Top 10—Top 10 Sports|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|date=June 17, 2008|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the [[Richard Adler|Adler]]–[[Jerry Ross (composer)|Ross]] musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]''—and record—[[George J. Gaskin]]'s &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide&quot;, [[Simon and Garfunkel]]'s &quot;[[Mrs. Robinson]]&quot;, and [[John Fogerty]]'s &quot;[[Centerfield (song)|Centerfield]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), pp. 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt; The baseball-inspired comedic sketch &quot;[[Who's on First]]&quot;, popularized by [[Abbott and Costello]] in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,36533,00.html|title=The Best of the Century|work=Time|date=December 26, 1999|accessdate=2009-05-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504145236/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C36533%2C00.html|archivedate=May 4, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of [[Ring Lardner]] and novels such as [[Bernard Malamud]]'s ''[[The Natural]]'' (the source for the movie), [[Robert Coover]]'s ''[[The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.]]'', and [[W. P. Kinsella]]'s ''[[Shoeless Joe (novel)|Shoeless Joe]]'' (the source for ''Field of Dreams''). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of [[Damon Runyon]]; the columns of Grantland Rice, [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], and [[Peter Gammons]]; and the essays of [[Roger Angell]]. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are [[Lawrence S. Ritter]]'s ''[[The Glory of Their Times]]'', [[Roger Kahn]]'s ''[[The Boys of Summer (book)|The Boys of Summer]]'', and [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]'s ''[[Moneyball]]''. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher [[Jim Bouton]]'s tell-all chronicle ''[[Ball Four]]'' is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neyer, Rob|author-link=Rob Neyer|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/ballfour/neyer.html|title='Ball Four' Changed Sports ''and'' Books|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 15, 2000|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. [[Baseball card]]s were introduced in the late 19th century as [[trade card]]s. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader [[trading card]] industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), pp. 16–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[fantasy sports]] began in 1980 with the invention of [[Fantasy baseball#Rotisserie League Baseball|Rotisserie League Baseball]] by New York writer [[Daniel Okrent]] and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as [[fantasy baseball]], it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800&amp;nbsp;million on the hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/07/prweb1084994.htm|title=Fantasy Sports Industry Grows to an $800 Million Industry with 29.9 Million Players|work=PRWeb|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2003), pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
