The '''1903 World Series''' was the first modern [[World Series]] to be played in [[Major League Baseball]]. It matched the [[American League]] (AL) champion [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston Americans]] against the [[National League]] (NL) champion [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]{{NoteTag|In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the [[name of Pittsburgh]] was often spelled without the 'h'.}} in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four.

Pittsburgh pitcher [[Sam Leever]] injured his shoulder while trap-shooting, so his teammate [[Deacon Phillippe]] pitched five complete games. Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League. Boston pitchers [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[Cy Young]] led Boston to victory. In Game 1, Phillippe struck out ten Boston batters. The next day, Dinneen bettered that mark, striking out eleven Pittsburgh batters in Game 2.

[[Honus Wagner]], bothered by injuries, batted only 6-for-27 (.222) in the Series and committed six errors.  The shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance.  The following spring, Wagner (who in 1903 led the league in batting average) refused to send his portrait to a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; for batting champions. &quot;I was too bum last year&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch?  I would be ashamed to have my picture up now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = DeValeria | editor1-first = Dennis | editor2-first = Jeanne | editor2-last = Burke | title = Honus Wagner: A Biography | location = Pittsburgh | publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press | year = 1995 | ref = devaleria95}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=138}}

Due to overflow crowds at the [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]] games in [[Allegheny City]],{{NoteTag|From 1882–1906, the team played in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]], which became annexed by [[Pittsburgh]] as the [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]] in 1907.}} if a batted ball rolled under a rope in the outfield that held spectators back, a &quot;ground-rule triple&quot; would be scored. 17 ground-rule triples were hit in the four games played at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forker |first1=Dom |last2=Stewart |first2=Wayne |last3=Pellowski |first3=Michael J |title=Baffling Baseball Trivia |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company |year=2004 |isbn=1-4027-1338-X |oclc=53374829 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bafflingbaseball0000fork }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series, Boston came back from a three games to one deficit, winning the final four games to capture the title. Such a large comeback would not happen again until the Pirates came back to defeat the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] in the [[1925 World Series]], and has happened only eleven times in baseball history. (The Pirates themselves repeated this feat in {{wsy|1979}} against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].) Much was made of the influence of Boston's &quot;[[Royal Rooters]]&quot;, who traveled to Exposition Park and sang their theme song &quot;[[Tessie]]&quot; to distract the opposing players (especially Wagner). Boston wound up winning three out of four games in Allegheny City.

Pirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]] added his share of the gate receipts to the players' share, so the losing team's players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning team's.

The Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.

==Background==

===A new league===
In 1901, [[Ban Johnson]], president of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], a minor league organization, formed the [[American League]] to take advantage of the National League's 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight.  Johnson and fellow owners raided the National League and signed away many star players, including [[Cy Young]] and [[Jimmy Collins]].  Johnson had a list of 46 National Leaguers he targeted for the American League; by 1902, all but one had made the jump.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=99}} The constant raiding, however, nixed the idea of a championship between the two leagues. Pirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], whose team ran away with the 1902 National League pennant, was open to a post-season contest and even said he would allow the American League champion to stock its roster with all-stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=105}}  However, Johnson had spoken of putting a team in [[Pittsburgh]] and even attempted to raid the Pirates' roster in August 1902, which soured Dreyfuss.  At the end of the season, however, the Pirates played a group of American League All-Stars in a four-game exhibition series, winning two games to one, with one tie.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=102}}

The leagues finally called a truce in the winter of 1902–03 and formed the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|National Commission]] to preside over organized baseball. The following season, the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates had secured their respective championship pennants by September. That August, Dreyfuss challenged the American League to an eleven-game championship series.  Encouraged by Johnson and National League President [[Harry Pulliam]], Americans owner Henry J. Killilea met with Dreyfuss in Pittsburgh in September and instead agreed to a best-of-nine championship, with the first three games played in Boston, the next four in Allegheny City, and the remaining two (if necessary) in Boston.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=122}}

One significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues. In short, it was a voluntary event, a fact which would result in no Series at all for {{wsy|1904}}. The formal establishment of the Series as a compulsory event started in {{wsy|1905}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsmenu.shtml|title=World Series : A Comprehensive History of the World Series by Baseball Almanac|last=http://www.geisleryoung.com/|first=Geisler Young, LLC -|website=www.baseball-almanac.com|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The teams==
[[File:1903 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 1903 Pittsburgh Pirates]]
The Pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful line-up that included legendary shortstop [[Honus Wagner]], who hit .355 and drove in 101 runs, player-manager [[Fred Clarke]], who hit .351, and [[Ginger Beaumont]], who hit .341 and led the league in hits and runs. The Pirates' pitching was weaker than it had been in previous years but boasted 24-game winner [[Deacon Phillippe]] and 25-game winner [[Sam Leever]].&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pages=119, 123}}

The Americans had a strong pitching staff, led by [[Cy Young]], who went 28–9 in 1903 and became the all-time wins leader that year. [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[Long Tom Hughes]], right-handers like Young, had won 21 games and 20 games each. The Boston outfield, featuring [[Chick Stahl]] (.274), [[Buck Freeman]] (.287, 104 [[RBI]]) and [[Patsy Dougherty]] (.331, 101 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored) was considered excellent.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=124}}

[[File:1903 World Series - Boston Americans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 1903 Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates]]
Although the Pirates had dominated their league for the previous three years, they went into the series riddled with injuries and plagued by bizarre misfortunes. [[Otto Krueger (baseball)|Otto Krueger]], the team's only [[utility player]], was beaned on September 19 and never fully played in the series. 16-game winner [[Ed Doheny]] left the team three days later, exhibiting signs of [[paranoia]]; he was committed to an [[insane asylum]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=122}} Leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm (which he made worse by entering a [[trapshooting]] competition). Worst of all, Wagner, who had a sore thumb throughout the season, injured his right leg in September and was never 100 percent for the post-season.&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pages=122–123}}

Some sources say Boston were heavy underdogs. Boston [[bookies]] actually gave even odds to the teams (and only because Dreyfuss and other &quot;sports&quot; were alleged to have bet on Pittsburgh to bring down the odds).&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page=124}} The teams were generally thought to be evenly matched, with the Americans credited with stronger pitching and the Pirates with superior offense and fielding. The outcome, many believed, hinged on Wagner's health. &quot;If Wagner does not play, bet your money at two to one on Boston&quot;, said the ''[[Sporting News]]'', &quot;but if he does play, place your money at two to one on Pittsburg.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;devaleria95&quot;/&gt;{{rp|at=quoted in p. 124}}

===Game 1===
Thursday, October 1, 1903, at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]

The Pirates started Game 1 strong, scoring six runs in the first four innings, and held on to win the first World Series game in baseball history. They extended their lead to 7–0 on a home run by [[Jimmy Sebring]] in the seventh, the first home run in World Series history. Boston tried to mount a comeback in the last three innings, but it was too little, too late; they ended up losing 7–3 in the first ever World Series game. Both Phillippe and Young threw complete games, with Phillippe striking out ten and Young fanning five, but Young also gave up twice as many hits and allowed three earned runs to Phillippe's two.

===Game 2===
Friday, October 2, 1903, at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]

After starting out strong in Game 1, the Pirates simply shut down offensively, eking out a mere three hits, all singles. Pittsburgh starter Sam Leever went 1 inning and gave up three hits and two runs, before his ailing arm forced him to leave in favor of [[Bucky Veil]], who finished the game. Bill Dinneen struck out eleven and pitched a complete game for the Americans, while Patsy Dougherty hit home runs in the first and sixth innings for two of the Boston's three runs. The Americans' [[Patsy Dougherty]] led off the Boston scoring with an [[inside-the-park home run]], the first time a lead-off batter did just that until [[Alcides Escobar]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] duplicated the feat in the [[2015 World Series]], 112 years later. Dougherty's second home run was the first in World Series history to actually sail over the fence, an incredibly rare feat at the time.

Phillippe, pitching after only a single day of rest, started Game 3 for the Pirates and didn't let them down, hurling his second complete game victory of the Series to put Pittsburgh up two games to one.

===Game 4===
Tuesday, October 6, 1903, at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]] in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]]

After two days of rest, Phillippe was ready to pitch a second straight game. He threw his third complete game victory of the series against Bill Dinneen, who was making his second start of the series. But Phillippe's second straight win was almost not to be, as the Americans, down 5–1 in the top of the ninth, rallied to narrow the deficit to one run. The comeback attempt failed, as Phillippe managed to put an end to it and give the Pirates a commanding 3–1 series lead.

===Game 5===
Wednesday, October 7, 1903, at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]] in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]]

Game 5 was a pitcher's duel for the first five innings, with Boston's Cy Young and Pittsburgh's [[Brickyard Kennedy]] giving up no runs. That changed in the top of the sixth, however, when the Americans scored a then-record six runs before being retired. Young, on the other hand, managed to keep his shutout intact before finally giving up a pair of runs in the bottom of the eighth. He went the distance and struck out four for his first World Series win.

Game 6 was a rematch between the starters of Game 2, Boston's Dinneen and Pittsburgh's Leever.  Leever pitched a complete game this time but so did Dinneen, who outmatched him to earn his second complete game victory of the series. After losing three of the first four games of the World Series, the underdog Americans had tied the series at three games apiece.

The fourth and final game in Allegheny saw Phillippe start his fourth game of the Series for the Pirates. This time, however, he wouldn't fare as well as he did in his first three starts. Cy Young, in his third start of the Series, held the Pirates to three runs and put the Americans ahead for the first time as the Series moved back to Boston.

===Game 8===
Tuesday, October 13, 1903, at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]

The final game of this inaugural World Series started out as an intense pitcher's duel, scoreless until the bottom of the fourth when [[Hobe Ferris]] hit a two-run single. Phillippe started his fifth and final game of the series and Dinneen his fourth. As he did in Game 2, Dinneen threw a complete game shutout, striking out seven and leading his Americans to victory, while Phillippe pitched respectably but just couldn't match Dinneen because his arm had been worn out with five starts in the eight games, giving up three runs to give the first 20th-century World Championship to the Boston Americans, Honus Wagner striking out to end the Series.
