'''Dieting''' is the practice of [[eating]] food in a regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight, or to prevent and treat diseases, such as [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]]. A restricted [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is more often pursued by [[overweight|those]] wanting to [[weight loss|lose weight]]. Continuous dieting is recommended by US guidelines for [[obesity|obese]] or [[diabetes|diabetic]] individuals to reduce body weight and improve general health.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDietaryGuidelines2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=US Department of Health and Human Services. |title=2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans - health.gov |url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/ |website=health.gov |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |accessdate=30 September 2019 |date=2017 |type=National guideline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGuidelines2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=MD |last2=Ryan |first2=DH |last3=Apovian |first3=CM |last4=Ard |first4=JD |last5=Comuzzie |first5=AG |last6=Donato |first6=KA |last7=Hu |first7=FB |last8=Hubbard |first8=VS |last9=Jakicic |first9=JM |last10=Kushner |first10=RF |last11=Loria |first11=CM |last12=Millen |first12=BE |last13=Nonas |first13=CA |last14=Pi-Sunyer |first14=FX |last15=Stevens |first15=J |last16=Stevens |first16=VJ |last17=Wadden |first17=TA |last18=Wolfe |first18=BM |last19=Yanovski |first19=SZ |last20=Jordan |first20=HS |last21=Kendall |first21=KA |last22=Lux |first22=LJ |last23=Mentor-Marcel |first23=R |last24=Morgan |first24=LC |last25=Trisolini |first25=MG |last26=Wnek |first26=J |last27=Anderson |first27=JL |last28=Halperin |first28=JL |last29=Albert |first29=NM |last30=Bozkurt |first30=B |last31=Brindis |first31=RG |last32=Curtis |first32=LH |last33=DeMets |first33=D |last34=Hochman |first34=JS |last35=Kovacs |first35=RJ |last36=Ohman |first36=EM |last37=Pressler |first37=SJ |last38=Sellke |first38=FW |last39=Shen |first39=WK |last40=Smith SC |first40=Jr |last41=Tomaselli |first41=GF |last42=American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice |first42=Guidelines. |last43=Obesity |first43=Society. |title=2013 AHA/ACC/TOS guideline for the management of overweight and obesity in adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and The Obesity Society. |journal=Circulation |date=24 June 2014 |volume=129 |issue=25 Suppl 2 |pages=S102-38 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.0000437739.71477.ee |pmid=24222017|pmc=5819889 |type=Professional society guideline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of [[skeletal muscle|muscle]]). Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight and improve health.

The first popular diet was &quot;Banting&quot;, named after [[William Banting]]. In his 1863 pamphlet, ''Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public'', he outlined the details of a particular low-carbohydrate, low-calorie diet that had led to his own dramatic weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jennifer Petrelli; Kathleen Y.

==Etymology==
According to Foxcroft, the word diet comes from the Greek ''diaita'', which represents a notion of a whole way healthy lifestyle including both mental and physical health, rather than a narrow weight-loss regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khawandanah |first1=Jomana |last2=Tewfik |first2=Ihab |title=Fad Diets: Lifestyle Promises and Health Challenges |journal=Journal of Food Research |date=15 November 2016 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=80 |doi=10.5539/jfr.v5n6p80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foxcroft2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foxcroft |first1=Louise |title=Calories &amp; corsets : a history of dieting over 2,000 years |date=2014 |publisher=Profile Books |isbn=978-1847654588 |type=Highly cited book |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=ih5qnNit-KIC |lay-url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20695743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:William Banting.png|thumb|[[William Banting]], popularized one of the first weight loss diets in the 19th century.]]
One of the first [[dietitian]]s was the English doctor [[George Cheyne (physician)|George Cheyne]]. He himself was tremendously overweight and would constantly eat large quantities of rich food and drink. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and soon regained his health. He began publicly recommending his diet for everyone suffering from obesity. In 1724, he wrote ''An Essay of Health and Long Life'', in which he advises exercise and fresh air and avoiding luxury foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/williams/cheyne.html|title=The Ethics of Diet - A Catena|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish military surgeon, [[John Rollo]], published ''Notes of a Diabetic Case'' in 1797. It described the benefits of a meat diet for those suffering from [[diabetes]], basing this recommendation on [[Matthew Dobson (physician)|Matthew Dobson]]'s discovery of [[glycosuria]] in [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elliott Proctor Joslin|title=Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus: Edited by C. Ronald Kahn ... [et Al.].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=20 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-2796-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of Dobson's testing procedure (for [[glucose]] in the urine) Rollo worked out a diet that had success for what is now called type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence D. Chalem|title=Essential Diabetes Leadership|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-5BIoIJT5YC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=5 September 2009|publisher=Laurence Chalem|isbn=978-1-4392-4566-8|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first popular diet was &quot;Banting&quot;, named after the English [[undertaker]] [[William Banting]]. In 1863, he wrote a booklet called ''Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public'', which contained the particular plan for the diet he had successfully followed. His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, sweet foods, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting's pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite EB1911

The first weight-loss book to promote calorie counting, and the first weight-loss book to become a bestseller, was the 1918 ''Diet and Health: With Key to the Calories'' by American physician and columnist [[Lulu Hunt Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber &amp; Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 185–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that over 1000 weight loss diets have been developed up to 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matarese2014&quot; /&gt;

==Types ==
{{further|List of diets}}

===Low-fat===
{{Main|Low-fat diet}}
Low-fat diets involve the reduction of the percentage of fat in one's diet. Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2–12&amp;nbsp;months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of {{convert|3.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} over habitual eating.&lt;ref name=Strychar/&gt;

===Low-carbohydrate===
{{Main|Low-carbohydrate diet}}
Low-carbohydrate diets are relatively high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic diet|ketogenic]]'' (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).

===Low-calorie===
{{Main|Calorie restriction}}
Low-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500–1,000 calories per day, which can result in a {{convert|0.5|to|1|kg|lb|abbr=off}} weight loss per week. One of the most commonly used low-calorie diets is [[Weight Watchers (diet)|Weight Watchers]]. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 [[randomized controlled trial]]s to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3–12 months.&lt;ref name=Strychar/&gt; Women doing low-calorie diets should have at least 1,000 calories per day and men should have approximately 1,200 calories per day. These caloric intake values vary depending on additional factors, such as age and weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strychar&quot; /&gt;

===Very low-calorie===
{{Main|Very low calorie diet}}
Very low calorie diets provide 200–800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average loss of {{convert|1.5|–|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per week. &quot;2-4-6-8&quot;, a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally [[fasting]], after which the cycle repeats. These is some evidence that these diets results in considerable weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thom2017&quot; /&gt; These diets are not recommended for general use and should be reserved for the [[management of obesity]] as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.&lt;ref name=Strychar/&gt;

===Meals timing===

Meals timing schedule is known to be an important factor of any diet. Recent evidence suggest that new scheduling strategies, such as [[intermittent fasting]] or skipping meals, and strategically placed snacks before meals, may be recommendable to reduce cardiovascular risks as part of a broader lifestyle and [[healthy diet|dietary change]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AHA2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=St-Onge |first1=MP |last2=Ard |first2=J |last3=Baskin |first3=ML |last4=Chiuve |first4=SE |last5=Johnson |first5=HM |last6=Kris-Etherton |first6=P |last7=Varady |first7=K |last8=American Heart Association Obesity Committee of the Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young; Council on Clinical Cardiology; and Stroke |first8=Council. |title=Meal Timing and Frequency: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. |journal=Circulation |date=28 February 2017 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=e96–e121 |doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476 |pmid=28137935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detox===
{{Main|Detox diet}}
Detox diets are promoted with unsubstantiated claims that they can eliminate &quot;toxins&quot; from the human body. Many of these diets use [[herb]]s or [[celery]] and other juicy low-[[calorie]] [[vegetable]]s.

===Religious===
Religious prescription may be a factor in motivating people to adopt a specific restrictive diet.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Ellen G|title=Counsels on Diet and Foods|year=1938|publisher=ePub|url=http://files.meetup.com/3500282/Counsel%20on%20Diet%20and%20Foods.pdf|access-date=3 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123937/http://files.meetup.com/3500282/Counsel%20on%20Diet%20and%20Foods.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Daniel]] (1:2-20, and 10:2-3) refers to a 10- or 21-day avoidance of foods ([[Daniel Fast]]) declared unclean by God in the laws of Moses.&lt;ref name=White /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloomer|first=Richard J|author2=Mohammad M Kabir |author3=Robert E Canale |author4=John F Trepanowski |author5=Kate E Marshall |author6=Tyler M Farney |author7=Kelley G Hammond |title=Effect of a 21 day Daniel Fast on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk factors in men and women|journal=Lipids in Health and Disease|volume=9|pages=94|year=2010|doi=10.1186/1476-511X-9-94|pmid=20815907|pmc=2941756|url=http://www.lipidworld.com/content/pdf/1476-511X-9-94.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern versions of the Daniel Fast, food choices may be limited to whole grains, fruits, vegetables, pulses, nuts, seeds and oil. The Daniel Fast resembles the vegan diet in that it excludes foods of animal origin.&lt;ref name=Bloomer/&gt;  The passages strongly suggest that the Daniel Fast will promote good health and mental performance.&lt;ref name=White /&gt;

[[Fasting]] is practiced in various religions. Examples include [[Lent]] in [[Christianity]]; [[Yom Kippur]], [[Tisha B'av]], [[Fast of Esther]], [[Fast of Gedalia|Tzom Gedalia]], the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|Seventeenth of Tamuz]], and the [[Tenth of Tevet]] in [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-mawrid.org/pages/articles_english_detail.php?rid=196&amp;cid=330&amp;search=fasting |title=History of the Fast |accessdate=2016-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227090756/http://www.al-mawrid.org/pages/articles_english_detail.php?rid=196&amp;cid=330&amp;search=fasting |archivedate=27 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslims]] refrain from eating during the hours of daytime for one month, [[Ramadan]], every year.

Details of fasting practices differ.  [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] fast during specified fasting seasons of the year, which include not only the better-known [[Great Lent]], but also fasts on every Wednesday and Friday (except on special holidays), together with extended fasting periods before Christmas (the [[Nativity Fast]]), after Easter (the [[Apostles Fast]]) and in early August (the [[Dormition Fast]]). Members of [[Latter Day Saint movement|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormon]]s) generally fast for 24 hours on the first Sunday of each month. Like Muslims, they refrain from all drinking and eating unless they are children or are physically unable to fast. Fasting is also a feature of [[ascetic]] traditions in religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. [[Mahayana]] traditions that follow the [[Brahma's Net Sutra]] may recommend that the laity fast &quot;during the six days of fasting each month and the three months of fasting each year&quot; [Brahma's Net Sutra, minor precept 30]. Members of the [[Baha'i Faith]] observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast]] from sunrise to sunset during March each year.

===Environmentally sustainable diets===
Another kind of diet focuses not on the dieter's health effects, but on its environment. The One Blue Dot plan of the BDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=BDA |title=Environmentally sustainable diets are a Win-Win for the planet and health say dietitians |url=https://www.bda.uk.com/news/view?id=221&amp;x[0]=news/list |website=www.bda.uk.com |accessdate=22 October 2019 |date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers recommendations towards reducing diets' environmental impacts, by:
# Reducing meat to 70g per person per day.
# Prioritising plant proteins.
# Promoting fish from sustainable sources.
# Moderate dairy consumption.
# Focusing on wholegrain starchy foods.
# Promoting seasonal locally sourced fruits and vegetables.
# Reducing high fat, sugar and salty foods overconsumption.
# Promoting tap water and unsweetened tea/coffee as the de facto choice for healthy hydration.
# Reducing food waste.

==Nutrition==
Weight loss diets that manipulate the proportion of macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have been shown to be no more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030201/cochrane.html|title=Cochrane for Clinicians: Are Low-Fat Diets Better than Other Weight-Reducing Diets in Achieving Long-Term Weight Loss? - American Family Physician|journal=American Family Physician|volume=67|issue=3|pages=507–8|date=February 2003|last1=Schooff|first1=Michael|pmid=12588072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.

The [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] is a set of recommendations about a healthy diet written for policy makers, nutrition scientists, and dieticians and other clinicians, produced by the [[US Department of Agriculture]], in concert with the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] and quintannually-revised.  The current guidelines are written for the period 2015 - 2020 and were used to produce the [[MyPlate]] recommendations on a healthy diet for the general public.

One of the most important things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trapp|first=Caroline B.|last2=Barnard|first2=Neal D.|date=2010-04-01|title=Usefulness of vegetarian and vegan diets for treating type 2 diabetes|journal=Current Diabetes Reports|volume=10|issue=2|pages=152–158|doi=10.1007/s11892-010-0093-7|issn=1539-0829|pmid=20425575}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as improved cardiac health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ornish|first=D.|last2=Brown|first2=S.

==How the body eliminates fat==
When the body is expending more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is [[glycogen]] (by [[glycogenolysis]]). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 [[kcal]] in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested [[nutrients|macronutrients]], mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins [[lipolysis]], the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or [[fat cells]], are broken down into [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]], which can be used to generate energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Rourke|first=Brian|last2=Cortassa|first2=Sonia|last3=Aon|first3=Miguel A.|date=2005-10-01|title=Mitochondrial Ion Channels: Gatekeepers of Life and Death|journal=Physiology|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=303–315|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2005|issn=1548-9213|pmc=2739045|pmid=16174870}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.

==Weight loss groups==
Some weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include [[WW International|Weight Watchers]] and [[Peertrainer]]. The latter include [[Overeaters Anonymous]], [[TOPS Club]] and groups run by local organizations.

These organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on [[twelve-step program]]s, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.

==Food diary==
A 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] showed that dieters who kept a daily food [[Personal journal|diary]] (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if a person records their eating, they are more aware of what they consume and therefore eat fewer calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Using food diaries doubles weight loss, study shows | url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-07-08-food-diaries%5FN.htm | date= 8 July 2008 | work=USA Today | first=Nanci | last=Hellmich | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible weight loss effects of drinking water prior to meals==
{{Main | Weight loss effects of water}}
A 2009 review found limited evidence suggesting that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages (i.e., reducing caloric intake) may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500&amp;nbsp;ml of water prior to meals for a 12-week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in [[Weight loss effects of water|main article]].)

==Fasting==
{{Main|Fasting|Intermittent fasting}}
Fasting is when there is a long time interval between the meals. In dieting, long term (periodic) fasting is not recommended, instead, having small portions of food after small intervals is encouraged. Lengthy fasting can also be dangerous due to the risk of [[malnutrition]] and should be carried out only under medical supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horne |first1=BD |last2=Muhlestein |first2=JB |last3=Anderson |first3=JL |title=Health effects of intermittent fasting: hormesis or harm? A systematic review. |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=August 2015 |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=464–70 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.115.109553 |pmid=26135345}}&lt;/ref&gt; During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the [[Human brain|brain]], causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of [[intermittent fasting]], have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent the issues of long fasting.

== Crash Dieting ==
{{Main|Very-low-calorie diet}}
The concept of crash dieting is to drastically reduce calories, using a [[very-low-calorie diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to diet |url=https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/how-to-diet/ |website=nhs.uk |language=en |date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Take the test: Is an 800-calorie diet right for me? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/crash_diet_test |website=BBC Food |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bonet |first1=Anna |title=Are crash diets ever a good idea for weight loss? |url=https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-eating/a25288668/are-crash-diets-bad-for-you/ |website=Netdoctor |date=28 November 2018 |quote='A crash diet is typically a very low-calorie diet, where you eat a very restrictively for a short period of time,' explains Registered Dietician, Helen Bond.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crash diets can cause transient deterioration in heart function |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180202123836.htm |website=ScienceDaily |language=en |date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crash dieting can highly be dangerous because it can cause various kind of issues for the human body. Crash dieting can produce weight loss but without professional supervision all along, the extreme reduction in calories and potential unbalance in the diet's composition can lead to detrimental effects, including sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How crash diets harm your health - CNN.com |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/20/crash.diets.harm.health/index.html |website=www.cnn.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are studies that show the health and medical benefits of weight loss, a study in 2005 of around 3000 Finns over an 18-year period showed that weight loss from dieting can result in increased mortality, while those who maintained their weight fared the best.&lt;ref name=&quot;weight science&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title= Weight science: evaluating the evidence for a paradigm shift |author= Bacon L, Aphramor L. |journal=Nutr J |year=2011 |volume=10|pmc=3041737 |pmid=21261939 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-10-9 |pages=9|last2= Aphramor }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingram DD, Mussolino ME. |title=Weight loss from maximum body weight and mortality: the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File |journal=Int J Obes |year=2010|volume=34|pages=1044–1050|pmid=  20212495 |doi=10.1038/ijo.2010.41 |issue=6|last2=Mussolino }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Sørensen TI, Rissanen A, Korkeila M, Kaprio J |title= Intention to Lose Weight, Weight Changes, and 18-y Mortality in Overweight Individuals without Co-Morbidities |journal= PLoS Medicine |year=2005 |volume=2|issue=6; e171|pmc=1160579 |pmid=15971946 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020171 |pages=e171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusion is drawn by other studies,&lt;ref name=&quot;weight science&quot; /&gt; and although other studies suggest that intentional weight loss has a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy, it is associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals and the slightly overweight but not obese.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrington&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Harrington M |author2=Gibson S |author3=Cottrell RC |title= A review and meta-analysis of the effect of weight loss on all-cause mortality risk |journal=Nutr Res Rev |year=2009 |volume=22|issue=1|pages=93–108 |pmid=19555520 |doi=10.1017/S0954422409990035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low carbohydrate versus low fat==
Low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets perform similarly in the long term as weight maintenance depends on calorie intake, not macronutrient ration.&lt;ref name=obes&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Churuangsuk C, Kherouf M, Combet E, Lean M| title=Low-carbohydrate diets for overweight and obesity: a systematic review of the systematic reviews. | journal=Obes Rev | year= 2018 | volume= 19 | issue= 12 | pages= 1700–1718 | pmid=30194696 | doi=10.1111/obr.12744 | pmc= |type=Systematic review  | url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/168899/1/168899.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low glycemic index==
&quot;The [[glycemic index]] (GI) factor is a ranking of foods based on their overall effect on blood sugar levels. The diet based around this research is called the [[Low GI diet]]. Low glycemic index foods, such as lentils, provide a slower, more consistent source of glucose to the bloodstream, thereby stimulating less insulin release than high glycemic index foods, such as white bread.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas|first1=Diana|author1-link= Diana Thomas |last2=Elliott|first2=Elizabeth J.|authorlink2=Elizabeth Elliott (paediatrician)|last3=Baur|first3=Louise|title=Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesity|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD005105|publication-date=18 July 2007|date=31 July 2006|pmid=17636786|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2|publication-place=USA|place=University of Sydney, Children's Hospital at Westmead, CEBPGAN (Centre for Evidence Based Paediatrics Gastroenterology and Nutrition|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005105/pdf_fs.html|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Diana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6259925&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=D.J.|last2=Wolever|first2=T.M.|last3=Taylor|first3=R.H.|last4=Barker|first4=H.|last5=Fielden|first5=H.

The glycemic load is &quot;the mathematical product of the glycemic index and the carbohydrate amount&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12949357&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brand-Miller|first1=Janette Cecile|last2=Thomas|first2=M.|last3=Swan|first3=V.|last4=Ahmad|first4=Z.I.|last5=Petocz|first5=P.|last6=Colagiuri|first6=S.|author1-link=Jennie Brand-Miller|title=Physiological Validation of the Concept of Glycemic Load in Lean Young Adults|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2728–32|publication-date=September 2003|pmid=12949357|publication-place=USA|place=Human Nutrition Unit, School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia|year=2003|doi=10.1093/jn/133.9.2728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[randomized controlled trial]] that compared four diets that varied in carbohydrate amount and glycemic index found complicated results:&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16864756&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMillan-Price|first1=J.|last2=Petocz|first2=P.|last3=Atkinson|first3=F.|last4=O'neill|first4=K.|last5=Samman|first5=S.|last6=Steinbeck|first6=K.|last7=Caterson|first7=I.|last8=Brand-Miller|first8=Janette Cecile|author8-link=Jennie Brand-Miller|title=Comparison of 4 Diets of Varying Glycemic Load on Weight Loss and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Overweight and Obese Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|publication-place=USA|place=Human Nutrition Unit, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia|volume=166|issue=14|pages=1466–75|publication-date=24 July 2006|pmid=16864756|doi=10.1001/archinte.166.14.1466|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Diet 1 and 2 were high carbohydrate (55% of total energy intake)
**Diet 1 was high-glycemic index
**Diet 2 was low-glycemic index
*Diet 3 and 4 were high protein (25% of total energy intake)
**Diet 3 was high-glycemic index
**Diet 4 was low-glycemic index

Diets 2 and 3 lost the most weight and fat mass; however, low density lipoprotein fell in Diet 2 and rose in Diet 3. Thus the authors concluded that the high-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index diet was the most favorable.

A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that low glycemic index or low glycemic load diets led to more weight loss and better lipid profiles. ''However'', the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] grouped low glycemic index and low glycemic load diets together and did not try to separate the effects of the load versus the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DE, Elliott E, Baur L |title=Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesity |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD005105 |year=2007 |pmid=17636786 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body weight homeostasis==
{{see also|Energy homeostasis#Imbalance}}
The Set-Point Theory, first introduced in 1953, postulated that each body has a preprogrammed fixed weight, with regulatory mechanisms to compensate. This theory was quickly adopted and used to explain failures in developing effective and sustained weight loss procedures. A 2019 systematic review of multiple weight change procedures, including alternate day fasting and time-restricted feeding but also exercise and overeating, found systematic &quot;energetic errors&quot; for all these procedures. This shows that the body cannot precisely compensate for errors in energy/calorie intake, countering the Set-Point Theory and potentially explaining both [[weight loss]] and weight gain such as [[obesity]]. This review was conducted on short term studies, therefore such a mechanism cannot be excluded in the long term, as evidence is currently lacking on this timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=DA |last2=Sewall |first2=A |last3=Zhong |first3=Y |last4=Barre |first4=L |last5=Shoen |first5=S |last6=Agaronnik |first6=N |last7=LeClair |first7=JL |last8=Zhuo |first8=W |last9=Pacanowski |first9=C |title=Quantifying the imprecision of energy intake of humans to compensate for imposed energetic errors: A challenge to the physiological control of human food intake. |journal=Appetite |date=1 February 2019 |volume=133 |pages=337–343 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2018.11.017 |pmid=30476522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common figure saying that «95% of dieters regain their weight after a few years», but this is not backed by scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fritsch |first1=Jane |title=95% Regain Lost Weight.

==Weight loss criticisms==
{{Main|Health at Every Size}}
The view of weight loss as a health goal is criticized by some who propose to rather seek health benefits, such as [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular biomarkers]] improvements, without necessarily seeking weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;weight science&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harrington&quot;/&gt; This hypothesis and movement is commonly named [[Health at Every Size]], and it argues that weight loss and dieting do not reliably produce positive health outcomes, and that the benefits of lifestyle interventions are real but independent of weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=Traci|last2=Tomiyama|first2=Janet A.|last3=Westling|first3=Erika|last4=Lew|first4=Ann-Marie|last5=Samuels|first5=Barbra|last6=Chatman|first6=Jason|title=Medicare's search for effective obesity treatments: Diets are not the answer.|journal=American Psychologist|date=April 2007|volume=62 | issue = 3|series=Eating Disorders|pages=220–233|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.62.3.220|pmid=17469900|citeseerx=10.1.1.666.7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is however a considerate amount of evidence that overweight is associated with increased all-causes mortality, and significant weight loss (&gt;10%) improves or reverses [[metabolic syndrome]]s and other health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thom |first1=G |last2=Lean |first2=M |title=Is There an Optimal Diet for Weight Management and Metabolic Health? |journal=Gastroenterology |date=May 2017 |volume=152 |issue=7 |pages=1739–1751 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.056 |pmid=28214525|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/137779/7/137779.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obesity and overweight |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight |website=www.who.int |language=en |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

It is estimated that about 1 out of 3 Americans is dieting at any given time. 85% of dieters are women. Approximately, sixty billion dollars are spent every year in USA on diet products, including &quot;diet foods,&quot; such as light sodas, gym memberships or specific regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/01/02/the-heavy-price-of-losing-weight|title=The Heavy Price of Losing Weight|last=Williams|first=Geoff|date=2 January 2013|website=US News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/diets-do-not-work-the-thin-evidence-that-losing-weight-makes-you-healthier.html|title=Planning to Go on a Diet?
