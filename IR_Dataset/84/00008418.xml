[[File:Eleazar Wheelock.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eleazar Wheelock]], Dartmouth College founder]]
Dartmouth was founded by [[Eleazar Wheelock]], a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister from [[Columbia, Connecticut]], who had sought to establish a school to train [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as Christian missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with [[Mohegan]] Indian [[Samson Occom]]. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to [[Long Island]] to preach to the [[Montaukett|Montauks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;

Wheelock founded [[Moor's Charity School|Moor's Indian Charity School]] in 1755.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools&quot;/&gt; The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by Dr. [[John Phillips (educator)|John Phillips]] in 1762, who would go on to found [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt; The head of the trust was a [[Methodist]] named [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].

[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]].]]
Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, [[Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet|John Wentworth]], provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a [[royal charter]] in the name of [[King George III]] establishing the College. That charter created a college &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing &amp; all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing &amp; christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others&quot;. The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]]—an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it—Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Dartmouth&amp;nbsp;– History&quot;/&gt; The College granted its first degrees in 1771.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleazar Wheelock and the Adventurous Founding of Dartmouth College&quot;/&gt;

Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chi&quot;/&gt; Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian [[Christianization]], went on to form his own community of New England Indians called [[Brothertown Indians]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chi&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Early Dartmouth Dunham.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest known image of Dartmouth appeared in the February 1793 issue of ''Massachusetts Magazine''. The engraving may also be the first visual proof of [[cricket]] being played in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;CricketRauner&quot;/&gt;]]
In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Dartmouth College case]], which challenged [[New Hampshire]]'s 1816 attempt to amend the college'  charter to make the school a public university. An institution called [[Dartmouth University]] occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt; [[Daniel Webster]], an [[alumnus]] of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an [[Contract Clause|illegal impairment of a contract]] by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his [[peroration]] with the famous words: &quot;It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Gibbs]], served as [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of [[Florida]].

In 1866, the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to [[Durham, New Hampshire]], in 1891, and later became known as the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unh.edu/main/brief-history |title=University Chronology &amp;#124; University of New Hampshire Library |publisher=Unh.edu |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Under President [[William Jewett Tucker]] (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor [[John Ordronaux (doctor)|John Ordronaux]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Many Bequests to Carity; Will of Dr. Ordronaux D{{nbsp}}...&quot;/&gt; 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold.

Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts &amp; Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the [[Geisel School of Medicine]] (established 1797), [[Thayer School of Engineering]] (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and [[Tuck School of Business]] (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of &quot;Dartmouth University&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot; /&gt; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]''), the school uses the name &quot;Dartmouth College&quot; to refer to the entire institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot; /&gt;

Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot; /&gt; Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the [[Dartmouth Workshop]], the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]], [[Dartmouth BASIC]], and [[Dartmouth ALGOL 30]]. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academics &amp; Research&quot; /&gt;

Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the [[University Press of New England]], a [[university press]] founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes [[Brandeis University]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Tufts University]] and the [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About UPNE&quot; /&gt;

Whereas in the case of the other rankings the results are adjusted to take account of the size of institutions, hardly any such adjustment is made by ARWU. So there is a distortion in favour of large institutions. If two institutions were to merge, the very fact of merger would mean that the merged institution would do nearly twice as well as either of the individual institutions prior to merger, although nothing else had changed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Dartmouth's small size and its undergraduate focus disadvantage its ranking in international rankings because international ranking organizations use formulas that favor institutions with a large number of graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivycoach.com/in-the-press/dartmouth-college-fares-poorly-in-international-rankings/|title=Dartmouth college fares poorly in international rankings|website=Ivy Coach|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the freshman class entering Fall 2019, Dartmouth received 23,650 applications of which 1,876 were accepted for an 7.9% admissions rate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, a record 46.3% were valedictorian or salutatorian, with 97% ranking in the top decile of their class. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1497, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33. More than 51% identified as being students of color, 15% are among the first generation in their families to matriculate to college, 10% are international students, and 12% are legacies.&lt;ref name=&quot;dartmouth6&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85.&lt;ref name=&quot;dartmouth.edu&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, with the exception of internationals, on a [[Need-blind admission|need-blind basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2015/09/18/college-ends-need-blind-admission-for-international-students/ |title=College ends need-blind admission for international students |accessdate=September 28, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929223025/https://thedartmouth.com/2015/09/18/college-ends-need-blind-admission-for-international-students/ |archivedate=September 29, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial aid ===
Dartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth practices need-blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. For international students, financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $100,000 or less and possessing typical assets. In 2015, $88.8 million in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.

=== The Dartmouth Plan ===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Baker Memorial Library 08 - Tower Room.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1|Tower Room in [[Baker Memorial Library]]]]
Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week [[academic term]]s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply &quot;D-Plan&quot;) is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-plan-admin&quot;/&gt; However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman, senior, or sophomore summer terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petition for Change&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Petition for Change in Enrollment Pattern |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/docs/change_in_enrollment_pattern.pdf |newspaper=Dartmouth |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-plan-admin&quot;/&gt; The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Working Rules and Procedures&quot;/&gt;

The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as &quot;a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.

=== Board of Trustees ===
[[File:Dartmouth Hall, Dartmouth College - general view.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Dartmouth Hall was reconstructed in 1906.]]
{{Main|Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College}}
Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president (''ex officio''), the [[governor of New Hampshire|state governor]] (''ex officio''), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called &quot;charter trustees&quot;), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (&quot;alumni trustees&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Trustees vote to expand size of board&quot;/&gt; The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.

Although the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;Board of trustees vote to change how Dartmouth College is run&quot;/&gt; the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Board adds 8 seats, ends century-old parity&quot;/&gt; In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided Association of Alumni sues College&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thedartmouth2&quot;/&gt; In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth College's Board of Trustees Elects Five Alumni as New Trustees&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemeny Hall and Haldeman Center&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaughlin Cluster Residence Halls&quot;/&gt; Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the [[Georgian architecture#Colonial Georgian architecture|Georgian colonial architecture]] style,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIC Historic Campus Architecture Project&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkin Olshin Lawson-Bell Architects&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A History of American Higher Education&quot;/&gt; a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Landscape Design Guidelines&quot;/&gt; The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Sustainability Initiative&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;College Sustainability Report Card 2008&quot;/&gt;

A notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite [[Dutch elm disease]]) include some 200 [[Ulmus americana|American elms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Old Growth – Dartmouth's elms endure as defining features of the campus |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dartlife/archives/17-3/elms.html| website=Dartmouth College website, Dartmouth Life Home |accessdate=December 26, 2014| date=June 2007| quote=The College's claim on the landscape began with the felling of the great white pines that grew on the plain above the Connecticut River; planting came later.

A circa 1840 watercolor image of the College depicts graceful young elms edging the Green. &quot;If you look at pictures of old Hanover,&quot; says John Gratiot, associate vice president for Facilities Operations and Management, &quot;Main Street and College Street were completely lined with elms, like a green tunnel.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=50 Trees in 50 Minutes |url=http://sites.dartmouth.edu/gradforum/2014/10/01/50-trees-in-50-minutes/| website=Dartmouth College website, The Graduate Forum |accessdate=December 26, 2014| date=October 1, 2014| url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104202313/http://sites.dartmouth.edu/gradforum/2014/10/01/50-trees-in-50-minutes/ |archivedate=January 4, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The [[Geisel School of Medicine]] is located in a complex on the north side of campus&lt;ref name=&quot;Maps and Directions&quot;/&gt; and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-maps&quot;/&gt; The [[Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center]], located several miles to the south in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], contains a 396-bed [[teaching hospital]] for the Medical School.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center&quot;/&gt; The [[Thayer School of Engineering]] and the [[Tuck School of Business]] are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-maps&quot;/&gt; The Thayer School comprises two buildings;&lt;ref name=&quot;d-maps&quot;/&gt; Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuck-campus&quot;/&gt; The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuck-campus&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Library Holdings&quot;/&gt; Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Kresge Physical Sciences Library, Paddock Music Library, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the [[Baker Memorial Library]] (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;Berry Library&quot;/&gt; Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} tower is an iconic symbol of the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker Library Bell Tower&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;No Bridge Left Unburned: Rage at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nhspe&quot;/&gt;

=== Athletic facilities ===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Memorial Field 02.JPG|thumb|[[Memorial Field (Dartmouth College)|Memorial Field]]]]
Dartmouth's original sports field was [[The Green (Dartmouth College)|the Green]], where students played [[cricket]] and [[old division football]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;dartmo-green&quot;/&gt; Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcaf&quot;/&gt; The center of athletic life is the [[Alumni Gymnasium (Dartmouth College)|Alumni Gymnasium]], which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a state of the art fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123&amp;nbsp;m) indoor track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alumni Gym&quot;/&gt; Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts ([[Leede Arena]]), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berry Sports Center&quot;/&gt; Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is [[Memorial Field (Dartmouth)|Memorial Field]], a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial Field&quot;/&gt; The nearby [[Thompson Arena]], designed by Italian engineer [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson Arena&quot;/&gt; Also visible from Memorial Field is the {{convert|91800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.

Dartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the [[Hanover Country Club]], Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rugby Fires It Up With New Clubhouse&quot;/&gt; The college also maintains the [[Dartmouth Skiway]], a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in [[Lyme Center, New Hampshire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Skiway&quot;/&gt; that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.

Dartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the [[downhill skiing]] industry is featured in the 2010 book ''[[Passion for Skiing]]'' as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book ''[[Passion for Snow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skiinghistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-Awards-Brochure-searchable.pdf |title=2013 IHSA Awards brochure |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928225042/http://www.skiinghistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-Awards-Brochure-searchable.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residential housing and student life facilities ===
Beginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to [[residential college]]s, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://now.dartmouth.edu/2015/11/college-unveils-six-house-communities-open-next-fall |title=College Unveils Six House Communities to Open Next Fall |publisher=Dartmouth College |date=November 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420181017/http://now.dartmouth.edu/2015/11/college-unveils-six-house-communities-open-next-fall |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or [[residential college]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt; The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt; Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assembly reworks UFC membership guidelines&quot;/&gt; More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt;

=== Student safety ===
In 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in &quot;total of reports of rape&quot; on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape. The ''Washington Post'' attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/06/07/these-colleges-have-the-most-reports-of-rape/|title=These colleges have the most reports of rape|first=Nick|last=Anderson|date=June 7, 2016|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth College had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a &quot;sexually violent or harassing manner&quot;, compared to 45.5% of students nationally.

Dartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus Life: Clubs and Organizations&quot;/&gt; In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 &quot;issue-oriented&quot; groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;COSO Student Organizations&quot;/&gt; Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DOCalumnimag&quot;/&gt; which includes the nationally recognized&lt;ref name=&quot;Big Green Bus in the News&quot;/&gt; [[The Big Green Bus|Big Green Bus]]; the campus's oldest a cappella group, [[The Dartmouth Aires]]; the controversial conservative newspaper ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;Reagan's Disappearing Bureaucrats&quot;/&gt; and ''[[The Dartmouth]]'', arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;nlestk&quot;/&gt; ''The Dartmouth'' describes itself as &quot;America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;nlestk&quot;/&gt;

Partially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the [[fraternities and sororities in North America|Greek system]] dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halls, Tombs and Houses: Student Society Architecture at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coed, Fraternity, and Sorority Administration&quot;/&gt; In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization;&lt;ref name=&quot;Transgenders try to navigate Greek system&quot;/&gt; since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of CFS Organizations at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to [[desegregate]] fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create [[coeducational]] Greek houses in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle&quot;/&gt; In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become &quot;substantially coeducational&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth to Abolish Fraternities and Sororities&quot;/&gt; this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interrogating the S.L.I.&quot;/&gt; The fraternities have an extensive history of [[hazing]] and [[alcohol abuse]], leading to police raids and accusations of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy: Inside Dartmouth's Hazing Abuses&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth in the glare of scrutiny on drinking&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the [[Sphinx (senior society)|Sphinx society]], housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thedartmouth.com/2012/10/05/mirror/the-pool-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel|title = Mirror at the End of the Tunnel|date = October 5, 2012|accessdate = December 2, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141121191739/http://thedartmouth.com/2012/10/05/mirror/the-pool-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel|archive-date = November 21, 2014|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native Americans at Dartmouth ===
[[File:40th Dartmouth Powwow (7210510954).jpg|thumb|right|The 40th Dartmouth Powwow]]
The charter of Dartmouth College, granted to [[Eleazar Wheelock]] in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian Tribes]] in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;/&gt; However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education.  The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named [[Samson Occom]], and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt;

The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt; In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a &quot;new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;about-nap&quot; /&gt; Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot; /&gt;

=== Traditions ===
{{Main|Dartmouth College traditions}}
[[File:2004 Winter Carnival Sculpture.JPG|thumb|Snow sculpture at the 2004 Dartmouth Winter Carnival]]

Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;15th President Installed at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; The college functions on a [[Academic term|quarter system]], and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as &quot;big weekends&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steph&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dartmouth Green: A Walking Tour of Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; or &quot;party weekends&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins Center offers many alternatives over weekend&quot;/&gt; In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a [[bonfire]] on the Green constructed by the freshman class.&lt;ref name=&quot;homecoming-history&quot;/&gt; Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdr-wc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Winter carnival to be held {{!}} News {{!}} Bates College|url = https://www.bates.edu/news/1997/01/13/winter-carnival-1997/|website = www.bates.edu|access-date = February 7, 2016|date = January 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Key History: Those Were the Days&quot;/&gt;

The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the [[Connecticut River]]. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Town, College Weigh Tubestock Changes&quot;/&gt; The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fieldstock, chariots await town approval&quot;/&gt;

Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the [[Moosilauke Ravine Lodge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Program&quot;/&gt; In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.

=== Motto and song ===
Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is ''Vox clamantis in deserto''. The Latin motto is literally translated as &quot;A calling voice in the wilderness&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Out of the Woods&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; but is more often rendered as &quot;A voice crying out in the wilderness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartlett Hall's Wheelock Memorial Window&quot;/&gt; Richard Hovey's &quot;[[Alma Mater (Dartmouth College)|Men of Dartmouth]]&quot; was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,&lt;ref name=&quot;homecoming-history&quot;/&gt; and became the school's official song in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Follow-up on the news; Song out of tune with the times&quot;/&gt; The song was retitled to &quot;Alma Mater&quot; in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.&lt;ref name=&quot;rscl&quot;/&gt;

=== Seal ===
{{Main|Seal of Dartmouth College}}
[[File:Seal of Dartmouth College.png|thumb|upright|left|Seal of Dartmouth College]]

Dartmouth's 1769 [[royal charter]] required the creation of a [[seal (emblem)|seal]] for use on official documents and diplomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;/&gt; The college's founder [[Eleazar Wheelock]] designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:

{{quote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words &quot;vox clamantis in deserto&quot; the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.&lt;ref name=&quot;collections&quot;/&gt;}}

On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer [[William Addison Dwiggins]] to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769&quot;, to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of &quot;1769&quot; to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.&lt;ref name=&quot;uspatent&quot;/&gt;

=== Shield ===
On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a &quot;Dartmouth College Shield&quot; for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769&quot; around 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;uspatent&quot;/&gt;

College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College&quot;/&gt; The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal&quot;/&gt; The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere.

=== Nickname, symbol, and mascot ===

Dartmouth has never had an official [[mascot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ad-green&quot;/&gt; The nickname &quot;The Big Green&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=590538|title=The|access-date=September 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507215935/http://www.dartmouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=590538|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (&quot;Dartmouth Green&quot;) as the school's official color in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;greencolor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History-of-Dartmouth-Hanover&quot;/&gt; Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname &quot;the Indians&quot;, a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad-green&quot;/&gt; This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the &quot;use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The 'Big Green' Nickname&quot;/&gt; Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Indians: The New Tradition&quot;/&gt; but never succeeded in doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Banning of the Indian&quot;/&gt;

Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become &quot;official&quot;. One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' was [[Keggy the Keg]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Straight from the Tap: the men behind the mascot&quot;/&gt; the mascot has received approval from only the student government.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedartmouth4&quot;/&gt; In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the &quot;Dartmoose&quot; as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;First SA meeting draws crowd&quot;/&gt;
