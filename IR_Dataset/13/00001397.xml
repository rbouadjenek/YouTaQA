'''AOL''' (stylized as '''Aol.''', formerly a company known as '''AOL Inc.''' and originally known as '''America Online''') is an American [[web portal]] and [[online service provider]] based in [[New York City]]. It is a [[brand]] marketed by [[Verizon Media]].

The service traces its history to an [[online service]] known as [[PlayNET]], which hosted [[Game#Multiplayer_games|multi-player games]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, [[Quantum Link]] (Q-Link), who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter. The initial Q-Link service was similar to the original PlayNET, but over time Q-Link added many new services. When a new [[IBM PC]] client was released, the company focused on the non-gaming services and launched it under the name America Online. The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like [[CompuServe]] and [[The Source (online service)|The Source]]. By 1995, AOL had about 3 million active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/1995/09/aol-2/|title=America, Online!|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOL was one of the early pioneers of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States. It originally [[Internet service provider|provided a dial-up service]] to millions of Americans, as well as providing a [[web portal]], [[e-mail]], [[instant messaging]] and later a [[web browser]] following its purchase of [[Netscape]]. In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate [[Time Warner]] in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of [[broadband]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-verizon-buys-faded-internet-pioneer-aol-for-4.4-bn-2015-5?IR=T|title=Verizon buys faded Internet pioneer AOL for $4.4 bn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AOL was eventually [[Spin-off (corporate)|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009, with [[Tim Armstrong (executive)|Tim Armstrong]] appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.

On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by [[Verizon Communications]] for $4.4 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout-cnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Imbert|first1=Fred|title=Verizon to buy AOL for $4.4B; AOL shares soar|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102670331|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=May 12, 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sawers |first=Paul |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-4-4b-acquisition-of-aol/ |title=Verizon completes $4.4B acquisition of AOL |work=VentureBeat |date=June 23, 2015 |accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== 1983–1991: Early years ===
AOL began in 1983, as a short-lived venture called '''Control Video Corporation''' (or '''CVC'''), founded by [[William von Meister]]. Its sole product was an online service called [[GameLine]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]], after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Alec |title=Stealing Time: Davin, Quinton, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner |year=2003 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7432-5984-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/stealingtimestev00klei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribers bought a [[modem]] from the company for [[United States dollar|US$]]49.95 and paid a one-time US$15 setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of US$1 per game.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite news|title=A Brief History of AOL|author=David Lumb|work=Fast Company|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3046194/fast-feed/a-brief-history-of-aol|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

In January 1983, [[Steve Case]] was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, [[Jim Kimsey]] became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend [[Frank Caufield]], an investor in the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein2003&quot; /&gt; In early 1985, von Meister left the company.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite book|title=Media Selling: Television, Print, Internet, Radio|author=Charles Warner|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4443-5927-5|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 1985, '''Quantum Computer Services''', an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video, with Kimsey as [[chief executive officer]], and [[Marc Seriff]] as [[chief technology officer]]. The technical team consisted of [[Marc Seriff]], Tom Ralston, Ray Heinrich, Steve Trus, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Craig Dykstra, Doug Coward, and Mike Ficco. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to take over the role of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.&lt;ref name=Warner /&gt;

Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]] computers, originally called [[Quantum Link]] (&quot;Q-Link&quot; for short).&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from [[PlayNET|PlayNet, Inc]], (founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl). The service was different from other online services as it used the computing power of the Commodore 64 and the [[Apple II]] rather than just a &quot;dumb&quot; terminal. It passed tokens back and forth and provided a fixed price service tailored for home users. In May 1988, Quantum and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] launched [[AppleLink]] Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Triangulation|201|Peter Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for [[IBM]]-compatible [[personal computer|PCs]] developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm |title=History of Computing Industrial Era (1985–1990) |work=The History of Computing Project |accessdate=September 24, 2005 |date=March 20, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051103111647/http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm| archivedate= November 3, 2005 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html |title=Apple II history chapter 22 |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=September 24, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828233812/http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html |archivedate=August 28, 2005 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Case promoted and sold AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in contrast to [[CompuServe]], which was well established in the technical community.&lt;ref name=Warner /&gt;

From the beginning, AOL included [[online game]]s in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:
* Graphical chat environments [[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]] (1986–1988) and [[Club Caribe]] (1988) from [[LucasArts]].
* The first online interactive fiction series [[QuantumLink Serial]] by [[Tracy Reed (writer)|Tracy Reed]] (1988).
* [[Quantum Space]], the first fully automated [[play-by-mail game]] (1989–1991).

[[File:America Online logo.svg|200px|thumb|left|First AOL logo as &quot;America Online&quot;, used from 1991 to 2005.]]
In February 1991, AOL for [[DOS]] was launched using a [[GeoWorks]] interface followed a year later by AOL for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], and [[GEnie]]. 1991 also saw the introduction of an original [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] title called ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' from [[Stormfront Studios]]; which was one of the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bladekeep.com/nwn/index2.htm|title=The Original Neverwinter Nights 1991–1997|work=bladekeep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue. Advertisements invited modem owners to &quot;Try America Online FREE&quot;, promising free software and trial membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;aol199408&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine

This also coincided with a new &quot;carpet bombing&quot; marketing campaign by CMO [[Jan Brandt]] to distribute as many free trial AOL trial disks as possible through nonconventional distribution partners.

Over the next several years, AOL launched services with the [[National Education Association]], the [[American Federation of Teachers]], ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Library of Congress]], [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|ASCD]], [[National School Boards Association|NSBA]], NCTE, [[Discovery Communications|Discovery Networks]], [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] Education Services ([[CNN Newsroom]]), [[NPR]], [[The Princeton Review]], [[Stanley Kaplan]], [[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], [[Highlights for Kids]], the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]], and many other education providers. AOL offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by children, for children (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers' Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit ([[Library of Congress]], 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Netstudy|author=Michael Wolff|publisher=Dell Publishing|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOL purchased search engine [[WebCrawler]] in 1995, but the next year sold it to [[Excite]] in a deal that makes Excite the exclusive search and directory service on AOL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://money.cnn.com/1996/11/25/technology/excite/ | title=AOL gets Excited – Nov. 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the deal closed in March 1997, AOL launched its own branded search engine, based on Excite, called NetFind.

=== 2015–present: Division of Verizon ===
[[File:AOL Silicon Valley office.jpg|thumb|left|AOL's Silicon Valley branch office.]]
On May 12, 2015, [[Verizon]] announced plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. The transaction was completed on June 23. [[Tim Armstrong (executive)|Armstrong]], who continued to lead the firm following regulatory approval, called the deal the logical next step for AOL. &quot;If you look forward five years, you're going to be in a space where there are going to be massive, global-scale networks, and there's no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon.&quot; he said. &quot;It's really not about selling the company today. It's about setting up for the next five to 10 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout-cnbc&quot; /&gt;

Analyst David Bank said he thought the deal made sense for Verizon.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout-cnbc&quot; /&gt;  The deal will broaden Verizon's advertising sales platforms and increase its video production ability through websites such as ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', [[TechCrunch]], and [[Engadget]].&lt;ref name=BBCbuy&gt;{{cite news|title = Verizon buys AOL for $4.4bn|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32702558|publisher=BBC|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate = May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Craig Moffett said it was unlikely the deal would make a big difference to Verizon's bottom line.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout-cnbc&quot; /&gt; AOL had about two million dial-up subscribers at the time of the buyout.&lt;ref name=BBCbuy /&gt;  The announcement caused AOL's stock price to rise 17%, while Verizon's stock price dropped slightly.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout-cnbc&quot; /&gt;

Shortly before the Verizon purchase, on April 14, 2015, AOL launched ONE by AOL, a digital marketing programmatic platform that unifies buying channels and audience management platforms to track and optimize campaigns over multiple screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AOL Corp|url = http://corp.aol.com/2015/04/14/aol-launches-one-by-aol/|website = AOL Corp|access-date = January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, on September 15, AOL expanded the product with ONE by AOL: Creative, which is geared towards creative and media agencies to similarly connect marketing and ad distribution efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AOL Corp|url = http://corp.aol.com/2015/09/15/aol-expands-one-by-aol-platform-to-drive-data-driven-personaliz/|website = AOL Corp|access-date = January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2015, AOL reported its first-quarter revenue of $625.1 million, $483.5 million of which came from advertising and related operations, marking a 7% increase from Q1 2014. Over that year, the AOL Platforms division saw a 21% increase in revenue, but a drop in adjusted OIBDA due to increased investments in the company's video and programmatic platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Quarterly Earnings – Investor Relations – AOL|url = http://ir.aol.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=147895&amp;p=quarterlyearnings|website = ir.aol.com|access-date = February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2015, AOL announced a deal with [[Microsoft]] to take over the majority of its digital advertising business. Under the pact, as many as 1,200 Microsoft employees involved with the business will be transferred to AOL, and the company will take over the sale of display, video, and mobile ads on various Microsoft platforms in nine countries, including Brazil, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, [[Google Search]] will be replaced on AOL properties with [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]]—which will display advertising [[Bing Ads|sold by Microsoft]]. Both advertising deals are subject to [[affiliate marketing]] [[revenue sharing]].&lt;ref name=nyt-aolads&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL in Deal With Microsoft to Take Over Display Ad Business|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/business/aol-in-deal-with-microsoft-to-take-over-display-ad-business.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 30, 2015|work=The New York Times|first=Dino|last=Grandoni|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-bingaolads&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL Takes Over Majority of Microsoft's Ad Business, Swaps Google Search For Bing|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/06/29/aol-takes-over-majority-of-microsofts-ad-business-swaps-google-search-for-bing/|accessdate=June 30, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|first1=Mike|last1=Shields|first2=Shira|last2=Ovide|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2015, AOL received two News and Documentary Emmy nominations, one for MAKERS in the Outstanding Historical Programming category, and the other for ''True Trans With [[Laura Jane Grace]]'', which documented the story of Laura Jane Grace, a [[transgender]] musician best known as the founder, lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the punk rock band [[Against Me!]], and her decision to come out publicly and overall transition experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://emmyonline.com/download/news_36th_nominations_revised-10.29.15.pdf|title =NOMINEES FOR THE 36th ANNUAL NEWS &amp; DOCUMENTARY EMMY® AWARDS ANNOUNCED|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160205061528/http://emmyonline.com/download/news_36th_nominations_revised-10.29.15.pdf|archivedate =February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AOL Desktop''' is an internet suite produced by AOL from 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208214123/http://daol.aol.com:80/software/|title=Free Software From AOL - Discover AOL|date=2007-12-08|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012033324/http://beta.aol.com/projects.php?project=helix|title=AOL® Desktop™ / AOL Helix|date=2007-10-12|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that integrates a [[web browser]], a [[Media player (application software)|media player]] and an [[instant messenger]] client.&lt;ref name=&quot;daol.aol.com&quot; /&gt; Version 10.X was based on [[AOL OpenRide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/projects/chat/chat_logs/20070808_Helix_FormalChat.html|title=August 8th Helix Beta Chat|work=aol.com|access-date=April 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072101/http://beta.aol.com/projects/chat/chat_logs/20070808_Helix_FormalChat.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is an upgrade from such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2007/07/26/aol-heads-in-new-direction-with-helix/|title=AOL Heads in New Direction with 'Helix'|work=BetaNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[macOS]] version is based on [[WebKit]].

AOL Desktop version 10.X was different from previous [[AOL Explorer|AOL browsers]] and AOL Desktop versions. Its features are focused on web browsing as well as [[email]]. For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser. In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. Primary buttons include &quot;MAIL&quot;, &quot;IM&quot;, and several shortcuts to various web pages. The first two require users to sign in, but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication. AOL Desktop version 10.X was late marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the AOL Desktop 9.X versions.

Version 9.8 was released, replacing the Internet Explorer components of the internet browser with [[Chromium Embedded Framework|CEF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/|title=Beta – Main|website=beta.aol.com|access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chromium Embedded Framework) to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of [[Google Chrome|Chrome]]

Version 11 of AOL Desktop, currently in Beta, is a total rewrite but maintains a similar user interface to the previous 9.8.X series of releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;beta.aol.com&quot; /&gt;

In 2017, a new paid version called AOL Desktop Gold was released, available for $4.99 per month after trial. It replaced the previous free version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.daytondailynews.com/lifestyles/free-aol-desktop-being-discontinued/O4gj3yO8S6oHqw7gzCNXWO/ | title=Free AOL Desktop is being discontinued}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[File:NoMoreAolCDs in Aachen.JPG|thumb|200px|A collection of AOL CDs sent to a student dormitory in Germany, 2002]]
In its earlier incarnation as a &quot;[[Closed platform|walled garden]]&quot; community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3.5-inch floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/aol-discs-90s/ | title=Comment How Much Did It Cost AOL To Send Us Those CDs In The 90s? &quot;A Lot!,&quot; Says Steve Case | publisher=Tech Crunch | date=December 27, 2010 | accessdate=June 11, 2013 | author=Siegler, M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marketing tactic was criticized for its environmental cost, and AOL CDs were recognized as ''[[PC World]]''{{'}}s most annoying tech product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dornin |first=Rusty |title=CD overload?

=== Community leaders ===
{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}Prior to mid-2005, AOL used [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]] called [[AOL Community Leader Program|Community Leaders]], or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries.  AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers]] dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link]] service in 1985.  Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.  Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN.  Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help.  During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.

Two former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]] against AOL, citing violations of [[United States labor law|U.S. labor laws]] in its use of community leaders.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;cisn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi = 10.1177/1367877909337858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000.  The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005.  Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.

Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.

In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a US$15&amp;nbsp;million payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of US$1.2&amp;nbsp;million for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.

Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual &quot;strike&quot; or &quot;sit-in&quot; to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).

=== Billing disputes ===
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.

AOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBB-AOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&amp;compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Account cancellation ===
Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or &quot;save&quot; subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or &quot;save&quot; half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or &quot;save&quot; percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum &quot;save&quot; rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&amp;nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBB-AOL&quot;/&gt; However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld.com&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |magazine= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13447232 |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Popken, Ben.

Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 3, 2006, [[Time Warner]] announced that the company would be dissolving AOL's retention centers due to its profits hinging on $1&amp;nbsp;billion in cost cuts. The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/aol/timewarner-dissolves-aol-retention-centers-191878.php AOL: TimeWarner Dissolves AOL Retention Centers].

=== Direct marketing of disks ===
[[File:AOL promotional CDs in Canada.jpg|thumb|Some promotional [[CD-ROM]]s distributed in Canada.]]
Prior to 2006, AOL was infamous for the unsolicited mass [[direct mail]] of 3½&quot; [[floppy disks]] and [[CD-ROM]]s containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/internet/10/17/aol.discs/ |title=Campaign: Send AOL CDs back |publisher=CNN  |author=Rusty Dornin |date=October 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''PC World'', in the 1990s &quot;you couldn't open a magazine (''PC World'' included) or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld.com&quot;/&gt;

The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups. One such was No More AOL CDs, a web-based effort by two IT workers&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030423062842/http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/home/aol_discs/ What to do with those AOL CDs], a March 2003 [[CBC News]] article&lt;/ref&gt; to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomore&quot;/&gt;  The website was started in August 2001, and an estimated 410,176 CDs were collected by August 2007 when the project was shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomore&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184342/http://www.nomoreaolcds.com/ Internet Archive Wayback Machine 2007 Aug 20 archive of NoMoreAOLCDs.com main page].

=== Software ===
In 2000, AOL was served with an $8&amp;nbsp;billion lawsuit alleging that its AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15&amp;nbsp;million, without admission of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardencitygroup.com/cases/pdf/AOL/AOLNotice.pdf Gardencitygroup.com] (PDF). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The AOL software then was given a feature called AOL Dialer, or AOL Connect on {{nowrap|[[macOS|Mac OS X]]}}. This feature allowed users to connect to the ISP without running the full interface. This allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use, especially if they do not favor the AOL Browser.

AOL 9.0 was once identified by [[Stopbadware]] as being ''under investigation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706 Stopbadware.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220101412/http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706 |date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for installing additional software without disclosure, and modifying browser preferences, toolbars, and icons. However, as of the release of AOL 9.0 VR (Vista Ready) on January 26, 2007, it was no longer considered badware due to changes AOL made in the software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol90vr StopBadware.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729205843/http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol90vr |date=July 29, 2012}}. StopBadware.org (January 26, 2007). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usenet newsgroups ===
When AOL gave clients access to [[Usenet]] in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: ''alt.aol-sucks''. AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to &quot;Flames and complaints about America Online&quot;. With AOL clients swarming [[Usenet]] newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as [[Eternal September]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/pages/chapter03/ch03_.html &quot;The Making of an Underclass: AOL&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505003755/http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/pages/chapter03/ch03_.html |date=May 5, 2011}} ''[[net.wars]]'' Chapter 3, Wendy M. Grossman, NYU Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June 25, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betanews.com/article/AOL_Pulls_Plug_on_Newsgroup_Service/1106664611 AOL Pulls Plug on Newsgroup Service]. BetaNews. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, [[Google Groups]]. AOL then provided community-based [[Internet Forum|message boards]] in lieu of Usenet.

=== Terms of Service (TOS) ===
AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the [[Terms of Service]] (TOS, also known as Conditions of Service, or COS in the UK). It is separated into three different sections: ''Member Agreement'', ''Community Guidelines'' and ''Privacy Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=221224 AOL Member Agreement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102134253/http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=221224 |date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.aol.co.uk/conditions-of-service/article/20060802090809990001 Conditions of Service – AOL Help&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501135751/http://help.aol.co.uk/conditions-of-service/article/20060802090809990001 |date=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.

There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolwatch.org/censory.htm Aolwatch.org].

=== Certified email ===
In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a [[certified email]] system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by [[spam filter]]s.

This decision drew fire from [[MoveOn]], which characterized the program as an &quot;email tax&quot;, and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004398.php | title=AOL, Yahoo and Goodmail: Taxing Your Email for Fun and Profit | author=[[Cindy Cohn]] |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |date=February 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A website called Dearaol.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dearaol.com/ |title=Stop AOL's Email Tax |publisher=dearaol.com |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104175854/http://www.dearaol.com/ |archivedate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL's use of Goodmail.

[[Esther Dyson]] defended the move in an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', saying &quot;I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and AOL, they will also be shared with the individual recipients.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/opinion/17dyson.html?ex=1300251600&amp;en=04138dcf8237c907&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=You've Got Goodmail | author=[[Esther Dyson|Dyson, Esther]] |work=New York Times |date=March 17, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search data ===
{{Main|AOL search data scandal}}
On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search [[Index term|keywords]] for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled ''A Picture of Search''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir.iit.edu/~abdur/publications/pos-infoscale.pdf IR.iit.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819050834/http://www.ir.iit.edu/~abdur/publications/pos-infoscale.pdf |date=August 19, 2006}}.

=== User list exposure ===
In 2003, Jason Smathers, an AOL employee, was convicted of stealing America Online's 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer. Smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8985989 |title=Ex-AOL worker who stole e-mail list sentenced |publisher=NBC News}}, August 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSG-PairNabbed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0623042aol1.html |title=Pair Nabbed in AOL Spam Scheme |publisher=[[TheSmokingGun.com]] |date= June 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smathers pled guilty to violations of the US [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/internet/02/04/aol.spam.plea/ Ex-AOL employee pleads guilty in spam case] CNN, February 4, 2005.

=== AOL's Computer Checkup &quot;scareware&quot; ===
On February 27, 2012, a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]] was filed against [[Support.com]], Inc. and partner [[AOL, Inc.]] The lawsuit alleged Support.com and AOL's Computer Checkup &quot;[[scareware]]&quot; (which uses software developed by Support.com) misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers, offered to perform a free “scan,” which often found problems with users' computers. The companies then offered to sell software—for which AOL allegedly charged $4.99 a month and Support.com $29—to remedy those problems.&lt;ref name=MediaPost&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/200692/aol-supportcom-settle-scareware-lawsuit-for-85.html | title=AOL, Support.Com Settle Scareware Lawsuit For $8.5 Million | work=MediaPost | date=May 20, 2013 | accessdate=October 7, 2014 | author=Davis, Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both AOL, Inc. and Support.com, Inc. settled on May 30, 2013, for $8.5 million. This included $25.00 to each valid class member and $100,000 each to [[Consumer Watchdog]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2012cv00609/251021/61/ |title=FINAL JUDGMENT ORDER. Signed by Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on 5/30/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Jacqueline Scott Corley]] wrote: “Distributing a portion of the [funds] to Consumer Watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here,” and “EFF’s mission includes a strong consumer protection component, especially in regards to online protection.”&lt;ref name=MediaPost/&gt;

=== NSA Prism program ===
Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including AOL. According to leaks of said program, AOL joined the PRISM program in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = Glenn | last2 = MacAskill | first2 = Ewen | title = NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others | date = June 7, 2013 | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hosting of user profiles changed, then discontinued ===
At one time, most AOL users had an online &quot;profile&quot; hosted by the [[AOL Hometown]] service.  When AOL Hometown was discontinued, users had to create a new profile on [[Bebo]]. This was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with Facebook.  When the value of Bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the $850 million AOL paid for it, users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again, on a new service called [[AOL Lifestream]].

AOL took the decision to shut down Lifestream on February 24, 2017, and gave users one month's notice to save off photos and videos that had been uploaded to Lifestream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AOL Lifestream Sunset Notification|url=https://help.aol.com/articles/aol-lifestream-sunset-notification|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the shutdown, AOL no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles.

During the Hometown/Bebo/Lifestream era, another user's profile could be displayed by clicking the &quot;Buddy Info&quot; button in the AOL Desktop software. After the shutdown of Lifestream, clicking &quot;Buddy Info&quot; does something that provides no information whatsoever about the selected buddy: it causes the [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] home page (www.aim.com) to be displayed.
