'''Alder''' is the common name of a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s ('''''Alnus''''') belonging to the birch [[family (biology)|family]] [[Betulaceae]]. The genus comprises about 35&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Northwest Trees: Identifying and Understanding the Region's Native Trees|last = Arno|first = Stephen|publisher = Mountaineers Books|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59485-041-7|location = Seattle, WA|pages = 165|last2 = Hammerly|first2 = Ramona}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[species]] of [[Plant sexual morphology|monoecious]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s, a few reaching a large size, distributed throughout the [[Temperate climate|north temperate zone]] with a few species extending into [[Central America]], as well as the northern and southern [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=6245|title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|author=|date=|website=apps.kew.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The common name ''alder'' evolved from the Old English word ''alor'', which in turn is derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''aliso''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com|access-date=29 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|alder}}  The generic name ''Alnus'' is the equivalent [[Latin]] name (which is also the source for ''Alamo'', the Spanish term for the tree).&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com|access-date=29 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Latin and the Germanic words derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''el-'', meaning &quot;red&quot; or &quot;brown&quot;, which is also a root for the English words ''[[Elk (disambiguation)|elk]]'' and another tree: ''[[elm]]'', a tree distantly related to the alders.&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt;

== Description ==

With a few exceptions, alders are [[deciduous]], and the leaves are alternate, simple, and [[serration|serrated]]. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly [[wind-pollinated]], but also visited by bees to a small extent. These trees differ from the [[birch]]es (''Betula'', another genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many [[conifer cone]]s.

The largest species are [[red alder]] (''A. rubra'') on the west coast of North America, and [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]] (''A. glutinosa''), [[native plant|native]] to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching over 30 m. By contrast, the widespread ''[[Alnus alnobetula]]'' (green alder) is rarely more than a 5-m-tall shrub.

== Ecology ==
Alders are commonly found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. Sometimes where the prevalence of alders is particularly prominent these are called [[alder carr]]s.  In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the [[Alnus rhombifolia|white alder]] (Alnus rhombifolia) unlike other northwest alders, has an affinity for warm, dry climates, where it grows along watercourses, such as along the lower [[Columbia River]] east of the Cascades and the Snake River, including Hells Canyon.

Alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on alders|butterflies and moths]].

''A. glutinosa'' and ''A. viridis'' are classed as environmental weeds in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayson|first=Howell|title=Consolidated list of environmental weeds in New Zealand|publisher=Department of Conservation|location=Wellington|date=May 2008|isbn=978-0-478-14412-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients.

=== Nitrogen fixation ===

Alder is particularly noted for its important [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with ''[[Frankia alni]]'', an [[actinomycete]], [[Filamentation|filamentous]], nitrogen-fixing [[bacteria|bacterium]]. This bacterium is found in [[root nodule]]s, which may be as large as a human fist, with many small lobes, and light brown in colour. The bacterium absorbs [[nitrogen]] from the air and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with [[sugar]]s, which it produces through [[photosynthesis]]. As a result of this mutually beneficial relationship, alder improves the [[Fertility (soil)|fertility of the soil]] where it grows, and as a [[pioneer species]], it helps provide additional nitrogen for the [[Ecological succession|successional]] species which follow.

[[Image:Alnus_rubra_seeds.jpg|right|thumb|A red alder seed is a tiny [[samara (fruit)|samara]] like those of all alders]]
Because of its abundance, red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils.  Red alder stands have been found to supply between 120 and 290 pounds of nitrogen per acre (130 to 320&amp;nbsp;kg per ha) annually to the soil.  From Alaska to Oregon, ''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''sinuata'' (''A. sinuata'', Sitka Alder or Slide Alder), characteristically pioneer fresh, gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers.  Studies show that Sitka alder, a more shrubby variety of alder, adds nitrogen to the soil at an average of 55 pounds per acre (60 per ha) per year, helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest.  Alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc.  Alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad-leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers.  Their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well, and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires.  In addition, the light weight of alder seeds (650,000 per pound, or 1.5 million per kg) allows for easy dispersal by the wind.  Although it outgrows coastal Douglas-fir for the first 25 years, it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than 100 years.  Red alder is the Pacific Northwest's largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad-leaved tree in the coastal Northwest.  Groves of red alder 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter intermingle with young Douglas-fir forests west of the Cascades, attaining a maximum height of 100 to 110 feet (30 to 33 m) in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in.  Alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Northwest Trees: Identifying and Understanding the Region's Native Trees|last = Arno|first = Stephen|publisher = The Mountaineers Books|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59485-041-7|location = Seattle, WA|pages = 165–69|last2 = Hammerly|first2 = Ramona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Wappen at grossarl.png|thumb|right|Alder coat of arms of [[Grossarl]], [[Austria]]]]

The [[catkin]]s of some alder species have a degree of edibility,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edible Alder Catkins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/DatabaseSearhResult.aspx|title=Plant Search Result|author=|date=|website=www.pfaf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be rich in protein. Reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste, they are more useful for survival purposes. The wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items such as coffee, salmon and other seafood.

Most of the pilings that form the foundation of Venice were made from alder trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakasako|first1=Eric|title=A Look at Venice: Past and Present|url=http://illumin.usc.edu/130/a-look-at-venice-past-and-present/|website=Illumin|publisher=University of Southern California|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alder bark contains the anti-inflammatory [[salicin]], which is metabolized into [[salicylic acid]] in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Ewing |title=The Great Alaska Nature Factbook: A Guide to the State's Remarkable Animals, Plants, and Natural Features |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLCCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT142 |date=2012 |publisher=Graphic Arts Books |isbn=978-0-88240-868-2 |pages=106,142 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Native American cultures use red alder bark (''[[Alnus rubra]]'') to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations. Blackfeet Indians have traditionally used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis. Recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains [[betulin]] and [[lupeol]], compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West |first=Gregory L. |last=Tilford |isbn=0-87842-359-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner bark of the alder, as well as [[red osier dogwood]], or [[chokecherry]], is used by some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in smoking mixtures, known as ''kinnikinnick'', to improve the taste of the [[bearberry]] leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Staff |year=2009 |url=http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=1355 |title=Bearberry |work=Discovering Lewis and Clark |publisher=The Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation |access-date=29 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218093355/http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=1355 |archive-date=18 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the Austrian town of [[Grossarl]].

Electric guitars, most notably those manufactured by the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]], have been built with alder bodies since the 1950s. Alder is appreciated for its claimed tight and even balanced tone, especially when compared to mahogany, and has been adopted by many electric guitar manufacturers.

As a [[hardwood]], alder is used in making furniture, cabinets, and other woodworking products. For example, in the television series ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' season 3 episode &quot;Things Become Extinct&quot; (1992), Native American Ira Wingfeather makes duck [[flute]]s out of alder tree branches while [[Ed Chigliak]] films.

Alder bark and wood (like [[oak]] and [[sweet chestnut]]) contain [[tannin]] and are traditionally used to tan leather.

A red dye can also be extracted from the outer bark, and a yellow dye from the inner bark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/ethnobotany/dyes.shtml|title=Native Plant Dyes|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
