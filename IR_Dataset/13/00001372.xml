'''Amber''' is [[fossil]]ized tree [[resin]], which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since [[Neolithic]] times.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; Much valued from antiquity to the present as a [[gemstone]], amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.&lt;ref name=Jersey&gt;&quot;Amber&quot; (2004). In Maxine N. Lurie and Marc Mappen (eds.) ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey'', Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|0813533252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amber is used in [[jewelry]]. It has also been used as a healing agent in folk medicine.

There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20161208&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=That Thing With Feathers Trapped in Amber?

(1995) ''The quest for life in amber''. Basic Books, {{ISBN|0-201-48928-7}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word ''amber'' derives from [[Arabic]]  {{lang|ar-Latn|ʿanbar}} {{lang|ar|عنبر|rtl=yes}}&lt;ref name=etym/&gt; (cognate with [[Middle Persian]] ''ambar''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinics.org/pahlavi/MacKenzie-PahlDict.pdf A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary, D N MacKenzie, Oxford University Press, 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203034323/http://www.rabbinics.org/pahlavi/MacKenzie-PahlDict.pdf |date=3 December 2012 }}, {{ISBN|0 19 713559 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) via [[Middle Latin]] ''ambar'' and [[Middle French]] ''ambre''. The word was adopted in [[Middle English]] in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as ''[[ambergris]]'' (''ambre gris'' or &quot;grey amber&quot;), a solid waxy substance derived from the [[sperm whale]]. 
In the [[Romance languages]], the sense of the word had come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century. At first called white or yellow amber (''ambre jaune''), this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main sense of the word.&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{OEtymD|amber}} and {{OED|amber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two substances (&quot;yellow amber&quot; and &quot;grey amber&quot;) conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats, whereas amber is too dense to float, though less dense than stone.&lt;ref&gt;see: Abu Zaid al Hassan from Siraf &amp; Sulaiman the Merchant (851), ''Silsilat-al-Tawarikh (travels in Asia)''.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;!--&quot;see&quot; this for what? what is this substantiating?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The classical names for amber, [[Latin]] ''electrum'' and [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἤλεκτρον#Ancient Greek|ἤλεκτρον]]}}  (''ēlektron''), are connected to a term ἠλέκτωρ (''ēlektōr'') meaning &quot;beaming [[Sun]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=King1&gt;
[[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] ([[Iliad]] 6.513, 19.398). The feminine {{lang|grc|ἠλεκτρίς}} being later used as a name of the [[Moon]].

==History== 
[[Theophrastus]] discussed amber in the 4th century BC, as did [[Pytheas]] (c. 330 BC), whose work &quot;On the Ocean&quot; is lost, but was referenced by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 to 79 AD), according to whose ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|The Natural History]]'' (in what is also the earliest known mention of the name ''[[Germania]]''):&lt;ref name=&quot;pliny37-11&quot;&gt;''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D11 37.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924171950/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D11 |date=24 September 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Pytheas says that the [[Gutones]], a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of [[Abalus]], upon the shores of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbors, the [[Teutones]].}}

Earlier&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23172;layout=;loc=4.26 IV.27.13] or IV.13.95 in the Loeb edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny says that Pytheas refers to a large island - three days' sail from the [[Scythia]]n coast and called [[Baltia|Balcia]] by [[Xenophon of Lampsacus]] (author of a fanciful travel book in Greek) - as ''Basilia'' - a name generally equated with ''Abalus''. Given the presence of amber, the island could have been [[Heligoland]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], the shores of [[Bay of Gdansk]], the [[Sambia Peninsula]] or the [[Curonian Lagoon]], which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
It is assumed{{by whom|date=March 2018}} that there were well-established trade routes for amber connecting the Baltic with the Mediterranean (known as the &quot;[[Amber Road]]&quot;). Pliny states explicitly that the Germans exported amber to [[Pannonia]], from where the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]] distributed it onwards.

The ancient Italic peoples of southern Italy used to work amber; the National Archaeological Museum of Siritide (Museo Archeologico Nazionale della Siritide) at [[Policoro]] in the [[province of Matera]] ([[Basilicata]]) displays important surviving examples.
Amber used in antiquity as at [[Mycenae]] and in the prehistory of the Mediterranean comes from deposits of [[Sicily]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:Gouttes-drops-resine-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Wood [[resin]], the source of amber]]
Pliny also cites the opinion of [[Nicias]] ({{circa}} 470–413 BC), according to whom amber{{quote|is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany.}} Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is &quot;produced by the Sun&quot;, Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of ''succinum'' (''sūcinum'', from ''sucus'' &quot;juice&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[succinic acid]] as well as ''succinite'', a term given to a particular type of amber by [[James Dwight Dana]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 37, section XI of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', Pliny wrote:

{{quote|
Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of &quot;succinum&quot; and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |p=Book 37.XI }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the [[electrostatic]] properties of amber, by saying that &quot;in Syria the women make the [[spindle whorl|whorl]]s of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of ''harpax'' [from ἁρπάζω, &quot;to drag&quot;] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues&quot;.

Pliny says that the German name of amber was ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/glasą#Proto-Germanic|glæsum]]'', &quot;for which reason the Romans, when [[Germanicus Caesar]] commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these islands the name of Glæsaria, which by the barbarians was known as Austeravia&quot;. This is confirmed by the recorded [[Old High German]] word ''glas'' and by the [[Old English]] word ''[[:wikt:glær#Old English|glær]]'' for &quot;amber&quot; (compare ''[[wikt:glass|glass]]'').
In [[Middle Low German]], amber was known as ''berne-, barn-, börnstēn'' (with etymological roots related to &quot;burn&quot; and to &quot;stone&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bernstein|title=Bernstein - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326142339/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bernstein|archivedate=26 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Low German term became dominant also in [[High German]] by the 18th century, thus modern German ''Bernstein'' besides [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''barnsteen''.

In the [[Baltic languages]], the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] term for amber is ''gintaras'' and the [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''dzintars''. These words, and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''jantar''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%8F%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C|title=янтарь — Викисловарь|website=ru.wiktionary.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619064023/https://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%8F%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hungarian ''gyanta'' ('resin'), are thought{{by whom|date=March 2018}} to originate from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''jainitar'' (&quot;sea-resin&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Early in the nineteenth century, the first reports of amber found in North America came from discoveries in [[New Jersey]] along [[Crosswicks Creek]] near [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], at [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], and near [[Woodbury, New Jersey|Woodbury]].&lt;ref name=Jersey/&gt;

==Composition and formation==
Amber is [[heterogeneous]] in composition, but consists of several [[resin]]ous bodies more or less soluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]], associated with an insoluble [[Bitumen|bituminous]] substance. Amber is a [[macromolecule]] by free [[radical polymerization]] of several precursors in the [[labdane]] family, e.g. [[communic acid]], [[cummunol]], and [[biformene]].{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}}&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Villanueva-García, Antonio Martínez-Richa, and Juvencio Robles [http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1567/EJ-1567C.asp Assignment of vibrational spectra of labdatriene derivatives and ambers: A combined experimental and density functional theoretical study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412074659/http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1567/EJ-1567C.asp |date=12 April 2006 }} [[Arkivoc]] (EJ-1567C) pp. 449–458&lt;/ref&gt; These labdanes are [[diterpene]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three [[alkene]] groups for [[polymerization]]. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as [[isomerization]] reactions, [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] and [[cyclization]].

Heated above {{convert|200|C}}, amber decomposes, yielding an '''oil of amber''', and leaves a black residue which is known as &quot;amber colophony&quot;, or &quot;amber pitch&quot;; when dissolved in oil of [[turpentine]] or in [[linseed oil]] this forms &quot;amber varnish&quot; or &quot;amber lac&quot;.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}}

===Formation===
Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into [[copal]]. Sustained heat and pressure drives off [[terpene]]s and results in the formation of amber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Patty C.|last=Rice|title=Amber: Golden Gem of the Ages. 4th Ed.|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4259-3849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this to happen, the resin must be resistant to decay. Many trees produce resin, but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes. Exposure to sunlight, rain, microorganisms (such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]), and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate the resin. For the resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them.&lt;ref&gt;Poinar, George O. (1992) ''Life in amber''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, p. 12, {{ISBN|0804720010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botanical origin===
[[File:Bernstein Bitterfeld, Gedanit, Bruchstücke 5658.jpg|thumb|Amber from Bitterfeld]]
Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the ''[[Agathis]]'' group.  Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus ''[[Hymenaea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=JB |last2=Poinar Jr |first2=GO |year=2002 |title=Amber: the organic gemstone |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=628–36 |doi=10.1021/ar0001970 |pmid=12186567}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from family [[Sciadopitys|Sciadopityaceae]] plants that once lived in north Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=A.

===Physical attributes===
Most amber has a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]], a [[refractive index]] of 1.5–1.6, a [[specific gravity]] between 1.06 and 1.10, and a melting point of 250–300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Poinar | first=George O. | last2=Poinar | first2=Hendrik N. | last3=Cano | first3=Raul J. | title=Ancient DNA | chapter=DNA from Amber Inclusions | publisher=Springer New York | location=New York, NY | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-387-94308-4 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4318-2_6 | pages=92–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusions===
[[File:Baltic-amber-fossils-inclusions.jpg|thumb|Baltic amber with inclusions]]
The abnormal development of resin in living trees (''succinosis'') can result in the formation of amber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherborn|first1=Charles Davies|title=Natural Science: A Monthly Review of Scientific Progress, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCzPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=succinosis&amp;q=succinosis|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped onto the ground, so the material may be useless except for varnish-making. Such impure amber is called ''firniss''.

Such [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]] of other substances can cause amber to have an unexpected color. [[Pyrites]] may give a bluish color.  ''Bony amber'' owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}} However, so-called ''black amber'' is really only a kind of [[Jet (lignite)|jet]].

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm |title=BBC News, &quot; Secret 'dino bugs' revealed&quot;, 1 April 2008 |work=BBC News |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828135744/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm| archivedate= 28 August 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraction and processing==

=== Distribution and mining ===
[[File:Baltic-amber-deposit-Yantarny.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Open cast]] amber mine &quot;Primorskoje&quot; in Jantarny, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]]

Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.
Historically, the [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] coast west of [[Königsberg]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] was the world's leading source of amber. The first mentions of amber deposits here date back to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leta.st/blog/2016/07/history-of-russian-amber-1/ &quot;The History of Russian Amber, Part 1: The Beginning&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315013751/https://leta.st/blog/2016/07/history-of-russian-amber-1/ |date=15 March 2018 }}, Leta.st&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in that area, which became the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706182814/http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm |date=6 July 2012 }}. Gurukul.ucc.american.edu. Retrieved on 19 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of ''blue earth'' have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

[[Caribbean amber]], especially [[Dominican amber|Dominican]] [[blue amber]], is mined through [[bell pit]]ting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Wichard, Wilfred and Weitschat, Wolfgang (2004) Im Bernsteinwald. – Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, {{ISBN|3-8067-2551-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] and polish it with whitening and water or with [[rotten stone]] and oil. The final luster is given by friction with flannel.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with [[linseed oil]], heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due.

Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of &quot;ambroid&quot; or &quot;pressed amber&quot;.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}} The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light.

Amber has often been imitated by other resins like [[copal]] and [[kauri gum]], as well as by [[celluloid]] and even [[glass]]. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called &quot;true amber&quot;.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

== Appearance ==
[[File:Colours of Baltic Amber.jpg|thumb|Unique colors of Baltic amber. Polished stones.]]

Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color &quot;amber&quot;, amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as &quot;cherry amber&quot;), green amber, and even [[blue amber]], which is rare and highly sought after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/amber/amber-gemstone-information-and-education.php|title=Amber: Natural Organic Amber Gemstone &amp; Jewelry Information; GemSelect|website=www.gemselect.com|access-date=2017-08-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828193355/https://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/amber/amber-gemstone-information-and-education.php|archivedate=28 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees, and despite the name it can be translucent, yellow, orange, or brown colored. Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah &quot;straw&quot; plus rubay &quot;attract, snatch&quot;, referring to its electrical properties), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba (which later became the Arabic word for [[electricity]], كهرباء ''kahrabā&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation—easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry.
Much of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as &quot;bony amber&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Amber&quot;. (1999). In G. W. Bowersock, Peter Brown, Oleg Grabar (eds.)

[[File:Ambre bleu dominicain 21207.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue amber]] from Dominican Republic]]
Although all [[Dominican amber]] is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is blue amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly [[ultraviolet]] light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about {{convert|100|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manuel A.

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and [[stalactite]]s, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}} It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.

==Classification==
Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. [[Terpenoid]]s, produced by [[conifers]] and [[angiosperms]], consist of ring structures formed of [[isoprene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) units.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; [[Phenolic resin]]s are today only produced by [[angiosperms]], and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct [[Medullosales|medullosan]]s produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of [[pyrolysis]]–[[gas chromatography]]–[[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0146-6380(92)90051-X|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—II.

{{technical|section|date=June 2019}}

===Class I===
This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or [[ozic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt; It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), while Ic uses ''enantio'' labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, ''enantio'' biformenes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0617.ch006|title=Amber, Resinite, and Fossil Resins|year=1996|last1=Anderson|first1=Ken B.|volume=617|pages=105–129|chapter=New Evidence Concerning the Structure, Composition, and Maturation of Class I (Polylabdanoid) Resinites|series=ACS Symposium Series|isbn=978-0-8412-3336-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ia====
Class Ia includes ''Succinite'' (= 'normal' Baltic amber) and ''Glessite''.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii/&gt; They have a communic acid base, and they also include much succinic acid.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

[[Baltic amber]] yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or ''bony'' varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name ''succinite''. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}} It can be distinguished from other ambers via [[IR spectroscopy]] due to a specific [[carbonyl]] absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of [[abietic acid]].&lt;ref name=Rottlaender1970&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natmus.dk/cons/reports/2002/amber/amber.pdf |title=Degradation and inhibitive conservation of Baltic amber in museum collections |year=2007 |author=Shashoua, Yvonne |work=Department of Conservation, The National Museum of Denmark |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511212102/http://www.natmus.dk/cons/reports/2002/amber/amber.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ib====
Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack [[succinic acid]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

====Ic====
This class is mainly based on ''enantio''-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and [[zanzibaric acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt; Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt;

Dominican amber differentiates itself from [[Baltic amber]] by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of [[fossil]] inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.&lt;ref&gt;George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. ''The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World'', (Princeton University Press) {{ISBN|0-691-02888-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resin from the extinct species ''[[Hymenaea protera]]'' is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not &quot;[[succinite]]&quot; but &quot;[[retinite]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, D. A. (1996) Amber – Window to the Past. – American Museum of Natural History, New York, {{ISBN|0810919664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class II===
These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as [[cadinene]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

===Class III===
These ambers are [[polystyrenes]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

===Class IV===
Class IV is something of a wastebasket;{{clarify|date=April 2018}} its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of [[cedrene]]-based sesquiterpenoids.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

===Class V===
Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and ''n''-alkyl compounds. Their main variety is ''[[Copaline|Highgate copalite]]''.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0146-6380(93)90111-N|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—III.

==Geological record==
[[File:HALAMB48.JPG|thumb|200px|Typical amber specimen with a number of indistinct inclusions]]
The oldest amber recovered dates to the [[Carboniferous|Upper Carboniferous]] period ({{Ma|Upper carboniferous|round=-1}}).&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1179328|pmid=19797645|title=Pushing Back Amber Production|year=2009|last1=Grimaldi|first1=D.|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5949|bibcode=2009Sci...326...51G|pages=51–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bray2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1177539|title=Identification of Carboniferous (320 Million Years Old) Class Ic Amber|year=2009|last1=Bray|first1=P.

Amber becomes abundant long after the Carboniferous, in the [[Early Cretaceous]], {{Ma|early cretaceous|round=-1}},&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; when it is found in association with [[Prehistoric insects|insects]]. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Levant, from Lebanon and Jordan. This amber, roughly 125–135 million years old, is considered of high scientific value, providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PoinarOthers2011a&quot;&gt;Poinar, P.O., Jr., and R.K. Milki (2001) ''Lebanese Amber: The Oldest Insect Ecosystem in Fossilized Resin.'' Oregon State University Press, Corvallis. {{ISBN|0-87071-533-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lebanon, more than 450 outcrops of Lower Cretaceous amber were discovered by Dany Azar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azar|first=Dany|title=Lebanese amber: a &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;|journal=Annales Universitatis Paedagogicae Cracoviensis|year=2012|volume=111|pages=44–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a Lebanese paleontologist and entomologist. Among these outcrops, 20 have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods. Even older, [[Jurassic]] amber has been found recently in Lebanon as well. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan including the oldest [[zoraptera]]ns, [[Cleridae|clerid beetles]], umenocoleid [[cockroach|roaches]], and achiliid [[planthopper]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PoinarOthers2011a&quot;/&gt;

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}}) is found as irregular [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s in marine [[Glauconite|glauconitic]] sand, known as ''blue earth'', occurring in the Lower [[Oligocene]] strata of [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] in [[Prussia]] (in historical sources also referred to as ''Glaesaria'').{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}} After 1945, this territory around [[Königsberg]] was turned into [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]], where amber is now systematically mined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jean|last=Langenheim|title=Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany|publisher=Timber Press Inc.|year=2003|isbn=978-0-88192-574-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears, however, to have been partly derived from older [[Eocene]] deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as [[glacial drift]]. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern [[Asia]] and the southern part of [[North America]]. [[Heinrich Göppert]] named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests ''Pinites succiniter'', but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called ''Pinus succinifera''. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

===Paleontological significance===
{{Paleontology}}

Amber is a unique [[Fossil|preservational mode]], preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms;&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/amber.shtml BBC – Radio 4 – Amber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212064001/http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/amber.shtml |date=12 February 2006 }}.

The preservation of prehistoric organisms in amber forms a key plot point in [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' and the [[Jurassic Park (film)|1993 movie adaptation]] by [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Making of Jurassic Park| author=Don Shay &amp; Jody Duncan| year=1993| p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, scientists are able to extract the preserved blood of [[dinosaurs]] from prehistoric [[mosquitoes]] trapped in amber, from which they genetically clone living dinosaurs.

In [[ancient China]], it was customary to burn amber during large festivities.

The modern name for amber is thought to come from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word, ambar, meaning [[ambergris]].&lt;ref name=Aber&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.emporia.edu/earthsci/amber/amber.htm|author = Aber, Susie Ward |publisher = Emporia State University|title = Welcome to the World of Amber|accessdate = 11 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428124042/http://www.emporia.edu/earthsci/amber/amber.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patent-invent.com/electricity/inventions/electron.html |title=Origin of word Electron |publisher=Patent-invent.com |accessdate=30 July 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114060214/http://www.patent-invent.com/electricity/inventions/electron.html |archivedate=14 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of [[sperm whale]]s and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern.

The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and/or the plant resin [[labdanum]], but due to the [[endangered species]] status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://teresacasimiro.com.sapo.pt/Bibliographic_References/21.pdf|title=Characterization of the Portuguese-Grown Cistus ladanifer Essential Oil|authors=Gomes, Paula B, Mata, Vera G, Rodrigues, A E|journal=Journal of Essential Oil Research|year=2005|doi=10.1080/10412905.2005.9698864|volume=17|issue=2|pages=160–165|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324060544/http://teresacasimiro.com.sapo.pt/Bibliographic_References/21.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8772}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;amber&quot; is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. [[Benzoin (organic compound)|Benzoin]] is usually part of the recipe. [[Vanilla]] and [[clove]]s are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

&quot;Amber&quot; perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum, [[benzoin resin]], [[copal]] (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), vanilla, [[Dammara resin]] and/or synthetic materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amber&quot;/&gt;

== Imitation ==

=== Imitation made in natural resins ===

Young resins, these are used as imitations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matushevskaya|2013|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Kauri resin from ''[[Agathis australis]]'' trees in New Zealand.
* The [[copal]]s ([[subfossil]] resins). The African and American ([[Colombia]]) copals from ''[[Fabaceae|Leguminosae]]'' trees family (genus ''[[Hymenaea]]''). [[Dominican amber|Amber of the Dominican]] or Mexican type ([[#Class I|Class I]] of fossil resins). Copals from Manilia ([[Indonesia]]) and from New Zealand from trees of the genus ''[[Agathis]]'' (family [[Araucariaceae]])
* Other fossil resins: [[burmite]] in [[Burma]], [[rumenite]] in [[Romania]], simetite in [[Sicilia]].
* Other natural resins — [[cellulose]] or [[chitin]], etc.

* Epoxy [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|novolac]] (phenolic resins), unofficial name &quot;antique amber&quot;, not in the use at present
* [[Polyesters]] (Polish amber imitation) with [[styrene]]. Ex.: unsaturated polyester resins (polymals) are produced by Chemical Industrial Works &quot;[[Organika]]&quot; in [[Sarzyna]], [[Poland]]; estomal are produced by [[Laminopol]] firm. Polybern or sticked amber is artificial resins the curled chips are obtained, whereas in the case of amber – small scraps. &quot;African amber&quot; (polyester, synacryl is then probably other name of the same resine) are produced by Reichhold firm; Styresol trade mark or alkid resin (used in Russia, Reichhold, Inc. patent, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wagner-Wysiecka|2013|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
