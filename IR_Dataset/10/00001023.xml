'''Anarcho-capitalism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[economic theory]] that advocates the elimination of centralized [[State (polity)|state]]s in favor of [[self-ownership]], [[private property]] and [[free market]]s. Anarcho-capitalists hold that in the absence of [[statute]] (which they describe as law by arbitrary autocratic [[decree]]s, or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[legislation]] swayed by transitory political special interest groups), society tends to [[contract]]ually self-regulate and civilize through the spontaneous and organic discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a &quot;[[voluntary society]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morris|first=Andrew|editor-first=Ronald|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|chapter=Anarcho-capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC|year=2008|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]]|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n8|isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4|oclc=750831024|lccn=2008009151|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham.

''Anticapitalism''. One World Publications. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anarcho-capitalist society, [[Police|law enforcement]], [[court]]s and all other security services would be operated by [[Private defense agency|privately funded competitors]] selected by consumers rather than &quot;centrally through confiscatory [[taxation]]&quot;. Money, along with all other goods and services, would be [[Free banking|privately and competitively provided]] in an [[open market]]. Personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would therefore be regulated directly by consumers and their directly selected agents through market-based dispute resolution organizations{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} under [[tort]] and [[contract]] law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under &quot;political [[monopolies]]&quot;, which they believe tend to generate corruption through the collectivization of property and distortion of market signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;&gt;Stacy, Don (2011).

Anarcho-capitalists believe that business [[Regulatory economics|regulations]], such as corporate [[Corporate social responsibility|standards]], [[public relations]], product [[Mandatory labeling|labels]], rules for [[consumer protection]], [[Business ethics|ethics]], and labor relations would be [[Industry self-regulation|self regulated]] via the use of competitive [[trade association]]s, [[professional association|professional societies]], and [[Standards organization|standards bodies]]. In theory, this would establish market-recourse for businesses' decisions and allow the market to communicate effectively with businesses by the use of [[Consumer organization|consumer unions]], instead of centralized [[Financial regulation|regulatory mandates]] for companies &quot;imposed by the state&quot;, which anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians argue are inefficient&lt;ref&gt;Yilmaz, Yesim (April 20, 1998).

Cato Institute. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[regulatory capture]].

According to anarcho-capitalists, various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. However, the first person to use the term in the mid-20th century was [[Murray Rothbard]], who synthesized elements from the [[Austrian School]], [[classical liberalism]] and 19th-century American [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|individualist anarchists]] [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (while rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the norms they derived from it).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the ''laissez-faire'' economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.&quot; Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard's anarcho-capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed-upon libertarian &quot;legal code which would be generally accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. For A New Liberty. [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty11.asp &quot;12 The Public Sector, III: Police, Law, and the Courts&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; This pact would recognize self-ownership, property, contracts, and tort law, in keeping with the universal [[non-aggression principle]].

Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from [[minarchists]], who advocate a small [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] [[night-watchman state]] limited to protecting individuals and their properties from foreign and domestic aggression; and from other [[anarchists]], who oppose private ownership of the [[means of production]] (tools, factories, raw materials, etc.), [[Renting|rent]], and other aspects of [[capitalism]] such as wage labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secB3.html#secb31|title=B.3 Why are anarchists against private property? - Anarchist Writers|website=anarchism.pageabode.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114010322/http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secB3.html#secb31|archivedate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/socialism-marxism-private-property-person-lennon-imagine-kenny-loggins/|title=End Private Property, Not Kenny Loggins|website=jacobinmag.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026190844/https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/socialism-marxism-private-property-person-lennon-imagine-kenny-loggins/|archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VforVoluntary normal.svg|thumb|190px|Symbol of [[voluntaryism]] using anarcho-capitalism colors]]
Anarcho-capitalists argue for a society based on the voluntary trade of [[private property]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] (in sum, all relationships that they believe are not caused by threats or violence, including exchanges of money, consumer goods, land and capital goods) in order to minimize conflict while maximizing individual liberty and prosperity. However, they also recognize charity and communal arrangements as part of the same voluntary ethic.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Karl. [http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/dop.html The Death of Politics]. Interview in Playboy Magazine, March 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Although anarcho-capitalists are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some propose that non-state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho-capitalist society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holcombe&quot;/&gt; For them, what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from the &quot;compulsory [[State (polity)|state]]&quot;. Deontological anarcho-capitalists believe that the only just and most economically beneficial way to acquire property is through voluntary trade, gift, or labor-based [[Homestead principle (ethics)|original appropriation]], rather than through aggression or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]].

Anarcho-capitalists see [[free-market]] [[capitalism]] as the basis for a free and prosperous society. [[Murray Rothbard]], who is credited with coining the term anarcho-capitalism,&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Modugno Crocetta, [https://mises.org/journals/scholar/roberta.pdf Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism in the contemporary debate.

For an earlier published use of &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; by Rothbard, see his [http://anthonyflood.com/rothbardknowyourrights.htm &quot;Know Your Rights&quot;] ''WIN: Peace and Freedom through Nonviolent Action'', Volume 7, No. 4, 1 March 1971, 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; said that the difference between free-market capitalism and [[state capitalism]] is the difference between &quot;peaceful, voluntary exchange&quot; and a collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N., [https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559 A Future of Peace and Capitalism]; Murray N. Rothbard, [https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?control=910 Left and Right: The Prospects for Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt; As anarcho-capitalists employ the term, capitalism is not to be confused with [[state monopoly capitalism]], [[crony capitalism]], [[Corporatism#Fascist corporatism|corporatism]], or contemporary [[mixed economies]], wherein market incentives and disincentives may be altered by state action.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press 2001. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore reject the state, seeing it as an entity which steals property (through taxation and [[Confiscation|expropriation]]), initiates aggression, has a compulsory monopoly on the use of force, uses its coercive powers to benefit some businesses and individuals at the expense of others, creates artificial monopolies and restricts trade and personal freedoms via [[drug laws]], [[compulsory education]], [[conscription]], laws on food and morality.

Anarchists view capitalism as an inherently [[authoritarian]] and hierarchical system and seek the abolishment of private property.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph]] (1840).

''Anarchism''.&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter holds that the abolishment of private property would require expropriation which is &quot;counterproductive to order&quot; and would in their opinion require a state.&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;/&gt; On the [[Nolan chart]], anarcho-capitalists are located at the extreme edge of the libertarian quadrant since they reject state involvement in both economic and personal affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan Chart&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nolanchart.com/faq/faq8.php |title=Q8.

Anarcho-capitalists argue that the state relies on initiating force because force can be used against those who have not [[Theft|stolen personal property]], [[Vandalism|vandalized private property]], [[Assault|assaulted anyone]], or [[Fraud|committed fraud]]{{Clarify|date=February 2020}}. Many also argue that [[Subsidy|subsidized]] [[Monopoly|monopolies]]{{Examples|date=February 2020}} tend to be corrupt and inefficient. Murray Rothbard argued that all government services, including defense, are inefficient because they lack a market-based [[pricing mechanism]] regulated by the voluntary decisions of consumers purchasing services that fulfill their highest-priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Power and Market: Defense services on the Free Market|author=Murray Rothbard|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes.asp|page=1051|quote=It is all the more curious, incidentally, that while ''laissez-faireists'' should by the logic of their position, be ardent believers in a single, unified world government, so that no one will live in a state of &quot;anarchy&quot; in relation to anyone else, they almost never are.|author-link=Murray Rothbard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anarcho-capitalists also argue that [[Private defense agency|private defense]] and [[court]] agencies would have to have a good reputation in order to stay in business. Furthermore, [[Linda and Morris Tannehill]] argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market and that a government's citizenry can not desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency.&lt;ref&gt;Linda and Morris Tannehill. ''[https://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf The Market for Liberty]'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard bases his philosophy on [[natural law]] grounds and also provides economic explanations of why he thinks anarcho-capitalism is preferable on pragmatic grounds as well. [[David D. Friedman]] says he is not an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] rights theorist, but is also &quot;not a [[utilitarian]]&quot;. However, he does believe that &quot;utilitarian arguments are usually the best way to defend libertarian views&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David D. The Machinery of Freedom.

{{quote|I define anarchist society as one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against the person or property of any individual.

Rothbard used the term anarcho-capitalism to distinguish his philosophy from anarchism that opposes private property&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-234237 &quot;Libertarianism&quot;] (2007).

While the Friedmanian formulation of anarcho-capitalism is robust to the presence of violence and in fact assumes some degree of violence will occur,&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David D. (1982) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_41.html &quot;Chapter 41: Problems&quot;] The Machinery of Freedom. Retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; anarcho-capitalism as formulated by Rothbard and others holds strongly to the central libertarian nonaggression [[axiom]]:

{{quote|The basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a self owner, having absolute jurisdiction over his own body. In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person. It follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or &quot;mixes his labor with&quot;. From these twin axioms – self-ownership and &quot;homesteading&quot; – stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society. This system establishes the right of every man to his own person, the right of donation, of bequest (and, concomitantly, the right to receive the bequest or inheritance), and the right of contractual exchange of property titles.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf &quot;Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution&quot;] Cato Journal 2, No. 1 (Spring 1982): pp. 55–99. Retrieved 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1982.2&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp ''The Ethics of Liberty''] Humanities Press {{ISBN|978-0-8147-7506-6}} p. 162 Retrieved 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the non-aggression axiom can be said to be a prohibition against the initiation of force, or the threat of force, against persons (i.e. direct violence, assault, murder) or property (i.e. fraud, burglary, theft and taxation).&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1973). [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty.asp ''For a new Liberty''] Collier Books, A Division of Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York: pp. 24–25. Retrieved 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The initiation of force is usually referred to as [[aggression]] or [[coercion]]. The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[List of libertarian political parties|libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military. However, others might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of &quot;state intervention&quot;, defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and—as the only entity in human society that derives its income from &quot;legal aggression&quot;—an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1982.2&quot;/&gt;

Some anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the non-aggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis. It is in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]] that Rothbard defined anarchism, &quot;a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']&quot;; and wrote that &quot;what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1975) [https://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_01.pdf ''Society Without A State (pdf)''] ''Libertarian Forum'' newsletter (January 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in the libertarian journal ''New Banner'', Rothbard said that &quot;capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html ''Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard''] The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal (25 February 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property ===
==== Private property ====
Central to Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism are the concepts of [[self-ownership]] and [[original appropriation]] that combines [[personal property|personal]] and [[private property]]:

{{quote|Everyone is the proper owner of his own physical body as well as of all places and nature-given goods that he occupies and puts to use by means of his body, provided only that no one else has already occupied or used the same places and goods before him. This ownership of &quot;originally appropriated&quot; places and goods by a person implies his right to use and transform these places and goods in any way he sees fit, provided only that he does not change thereby uninvitedly the physical integrity of places and goods originally appropriated by another person. In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in John Locke's phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary&amp;nbsp;– contractual&amp;nbsp;– transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoppe-2002&quot;&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2002) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html &quot;Rothbardian Ethics&quot;] Retrieved 23 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anarcho-capitalism uses the following terms in ways that may differ from common usage or various anarchist movements.
* Anarchism: any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (includes opposition to the state)
* Contract: a voluntary binding agreement between persons
* Coercion: physical force or threat of such against persons or property
* Capitalism: economic system where the means of production are privately owned and where investments, production, distribution, income and prices are determined through the operation of a free market rather than by statutory regulation
* Free market: a market where all decisions regarding transfer of money, goods (including capital goods) and services are voluntary
* Fraud: inducing one to part with something of value through the use of dishonesty
* State: an organization that taxes and engages in regularized and institutionalized aggressive coercion
* Voluntary: any action not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by any human agency

The root of anarcho-capitalist [[property rights]] differ from that of anarchism, especially forms of anarchism such as [[anarcho-communism]], where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed &quot;according to need&quot; (which is to be determined and enforced collectively).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e. private) ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual &quot;needs&quot; or does not &quot;need&quot;. After property is transformed through labor, it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift – forced transfers are considered illegitimate (anarcho-capitalists do not consider wage labour to be a forced transfer). Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same &quot;absolute right&quot; as his own body, and retaining those rights forever, regardless if the resource is still being used by them. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it—it is only by using land and by mixing one's labor with it that original appropriation is legitimized: &quot;Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be&quot;. Rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the person's property as &quot;for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1962&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1962).

Rothbard writes:

{{quote|It is not enough to call simply for defense of &quot;the rights of private property&quot;; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be &quot;private&quot; must now be defended by libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;}}

In ''Justice and Property Right'', Rothbard writes that &quot;any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property&quot;. In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases &quot;the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed&quot;. He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the &quot;homestead principle&quot;. If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and &quot;return to the private sector&quot;, writing that &quot;any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible&quot;. For example, he proposes that [[State university|state universities]] be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally &quot;private property&quot; if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers, writing: &quot;What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not 'private' property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property&quot;. Likewise, Karl Hess says that &quot;libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private [...] Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Karl (1969) ''[https://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf Letter From Washington]'' The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:

{{quote|For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, rape, trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the ethics of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoppe-2002&quot;/&gt;}}

==== Common property ====
Although anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers and portions of oceans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holcombe&quot;&gt;Holcombe, Randall G., [https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_1.pdf Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 19, No. 2 (Spring 2005):3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist theorist [[Roderick T. Long]] gives the following example:

{{quote|Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community it's hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen branches in the way. But over time the way is cleared and a path forms&amp;nbsp;– not through any coordinated efforts, but simply as a result of all the individuals walking by that way day after day. The cleared path is the product of labor&amp;nbsp;– not any individual's labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the villagers together have earned.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T. 199. &quot;A Plea for Public Property&quot;. ''Formulations'' 5, no. 3 (Spring)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, since anarcho-capitalists believe that property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;/&gt; to the extent of the number of owners—and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely—anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional [[communal]] arrangements. [[Privatization]], [[decentralization]] and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. However, in some cases they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Anarcho-capitalists tend to concur with [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalists]] regarding the &quot;environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements&quot;. Air, water and land pollution, for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. They believe that central governments generally strike down individual or [[class action]] censure of polluters in order to benefit &quot;the many&quot; and legal or economic [[subsidy]] of [[heavy industry]] is justified by many politicians for [[job creation]] within a political territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;/&gt;

=== Economics ===
[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926–1995) coined the word anarcho-capitalism]]
Rothbard attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating &quot;private property anarchism&quot; in 1949 and later came up with the alternative name &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot;. He was probably the first to use &quot;libertarian&quot; in its current United States pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an anti-[[Statism|statist]] and anti-[[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]], but later had a falling-out. When interventionist [[Cold War]]riors of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], gained influence in the Republican Party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with left-wing [[antiwar]] groups. He believed that the Cold Warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to [[Trotskyist]] theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard16.html LewRockwell.com]. Retrieved 10 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard opposed the founding of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists.

=== Contractual society ===
[[File:Althing-stamp.jpg|thumb|A postage stamp celebrating the thousandth anniversary of the Icelandic parliament—according to a theory associated with the economist [[David D. Friedman]], medieval Icelandic society had some features of anarcho-capitalism; chieftaincies could be bought and sold and were not geographical monopolies; and individuals could voluntarily choose membership in any chieftain's clan]]
The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the &quot;contractual society&quot;—i.e. &quot;a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1962&quot;/&gt; in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements (contracts) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.

One particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer insurance and [[Bereavement benefit|death benefits]] to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]—another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.

Rothbard argues that corporations would exist in a free society as they are &quot;simply the pooling of capital&quot;. He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: &quot;Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1962&quot;/&gt; However, corporations created in this way would not be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that &quot;limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy &amp; State with Power and Market, [https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11 Mises.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothbard-1982.2&quot;/&gt; and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will and which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nozick-1973&quot;&gt;[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, [[David D. Friedman]] has expressed preference for a society where &quot;almost everyone is self-employed&quot; and &quot;instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper &amp; Row. pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.

=== Law and order and the use of violence ===
Different anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Morris and Linda Tannehill object to any [[Statute|statutory]] law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see [[tort]]) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Susan Love, ''The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View'', Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, Rothbard supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.

Unlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an [[ideological]] commonality of ethics and [[morality]] as a requirement, David D. Friedman proposes that &quot;the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;koltwm&quot;&gt;Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom''. Second edition. La Salle, Ill, Open Court, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society &quot;remains to be proven&quot;. He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs, but he thinks this would be rare. He reasons that &quot;if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims, that law [...] will not survive in an anarcho-capitalist society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism''. Harper &amp; Row. pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty (i.e. courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. However, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation, but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force—that is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. If competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would also be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists. According to Molinari: &quot;Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molinari-1849&quot;&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] ''(trans.

The defense of those unable to pay for such protection might be financed by charitable organizations relying on voluntary donation rather than by state institutions relying on coercive taxation, or by cooperative self-help by groups of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N.

Anarcho-capitalists believe that [[subrogation]], which allows remuneration for losses and damages to be funded by the aggressors, reduces insurance costs and could operate as a business in itself—converting victims from paying customers into direct beneficiaries. The concept of restitution transfer and recoupment (RTR) has been explored by freenation theorist John Frederic Kosanke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.seasteading.org/index.php/Restitution_Transfer_and_Recoupment|title=Restitution Transfer and Recoupment - Seasteading|website=wiki.seasteading.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTR agencies would employ [[performance bond|bonding]] agencies, [[private investigators]], private dispute resolution organizations and private aggressor containment agencies as required. Instead of having to pay for restitution, victims sell restitution rights to the RTR agencies. This arrangement can be compared{{weasel inline|date=June 2019}} to the contractual nature of the Goðorð system employed in the Icelandic Commonwealth by competing chieftains.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Edward Stringham argues that private adjudication of disputes could enable the market to internalize externalities and provide services that customers desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=Private Governance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stringham 60&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caplan|first1=Bryan|last2=Stringham|first2=Edward|title=Privatizing the Adjudication of Disputes|journal=Theoretical Inquiries in Law|date=2008|volume=9|issue=2|pages=503–28|ssrn=1674441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.jpg|thumb|Murray Rothbard admired the [[American Revolutionary War]] and believed it is the only United States war that can be justified]]
Like [[classical liberalism]] and unlike [[anarcho-pacifism]], anarcho-capitalism permits the use of force as long as it is in the defense of persons or property. The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. [[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe prisons or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf &quot;Retribution versus Restitution&quot;] Legal Notes No. 5, Libertarian Alliance {{ISBN|978-1-870614-22-1}} Retrieved 19 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce L. Benson]] argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, &quot;standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Bruce|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]]|year=1998|pages=235–38|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. However, the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|url=https://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf|pages=105–06|isbn=978-0-930073-08-4|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]]) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire the [[American Revolution]] as &quot;the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[Tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties&quot;. In fact, according to Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) [http://www.antiwar.com/orig/rothbard_on_war.html Interview] ''Reason'' February 1973. Retrieved 10 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some anarcho-capitalists, such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], feel that violent revolution is counter-productive and prefer voluntary forms of [[economic secession]] to the extent possible.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

== Branches ==
The two principal moral approaches to anarcho-capitalism differ in regard to whether anarcho-capitalist society is justified on [[deontological]] or [[consequentialist]] ethics, or both. Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56&quot;&gt;Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on &quot;[[market failure]]&quot;, but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see [[government failure]]) to compare the net result, nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-1973&quot;/&gt;

Kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since in the absence of statutory law the [[non-aggression principle]] is naturally enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace. For him, the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state, or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form.&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;/&gt;

In both its [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist]] forms, anarchism is usually considered a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing]] and [[anti-capitalist]] ideology that promotes socialist economic theories such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[communism]], [[syndicalism]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite book |quote=Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism, from the hyperrationalism of Godwin, to the egoism of Stirner, to the libertarians and anarcho-capitalists of today |last=Brooks |first=Frank H. |year=1994 |title=The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908) |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page=xi|isbn=1-56000-132-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joseph Kahn|title= Anarchism, the Creed That Won't Stay Dead; The Spread of World Capitalism Resurrects a Long-Dormant Movement |year=2000|journal=[[The New York Times]]|issue=5 August |ref=harv}}{{cite journal |author=Colin Moynihan |title=Book Fair Unites Anarchists.

It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they argue that capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which is incompatible with an anarchist society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56&quot;/&gt;

Murray Rothbard argues that the capitalist system of today is not properly anarcho-capitalist because it so often colludes with the state. According to Rothbard, &quot;what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fpc&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1973). &quot;[https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559 A Future of Peace and Capitalism]&quot;.

Rothbard maintains that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism—the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he argues that any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology, such as &quot;redistribution of private property&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N (25 February 1972). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard]. ''The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society, such as cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses and so on.

Moreover, anarcho-capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of anarchist ideals as advocated by what they term &quot;[[left-wing anarchists]]&quot; would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. Based on their understanding of anarchism, in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital, which they believe is a goal of those anarchists, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. They conclude that this body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is what anarcho-capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under a &quot;coercively&quot; egalitarian-anarchist system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, anarchists argue that a state is required to maintain private property and for capitalism to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rocker |first=Rudolf |date=1938 |title=Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice.

Rothbard also wrote a piece published posthumously entitled &quot;Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?&quot; in which he traced the etymological roots of anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that &quot;we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines&quot;. Furthermore, he wrote: &quot;We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/2801|title=Mises Daily|work=Mises Institute|date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Classical liberalism ===
{{main|Classical liberalism}}
Classical liberalism is the primary influence with the longest history on anarcho-capitalist theory. Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]] while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Frédéric Bastiat]] (''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]''), who wrote: &quot;The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else&quot;. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote: &quot;I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Literature/Thoreau/CivilDisobedience.html Civil Disobedience]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}

The early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The &quot;normative core&quot; of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of ''laissez-faire'', a [[spontaneous order]] of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants.&lt;ref&gt;Razeen, Sally. ''Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History'', Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|978-0-415-16493-1}}, 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So they advocated what may be seen as{{weasel inline|date=July 2019}} classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. In the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same.

In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: &quot;No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity&quot;. Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers &quot;had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035217/http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm |date=10 June 2009 }}, Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society vs. state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molinari-1849&quot;/&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].

In the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the Old Right.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]] and [[H. L. Mencken]]. In the 1950s, the new &quot;fusion conservatism&quot;, also called &quot;[[Cold War]] conservatism&quot;, took hold of the right-wing in the United States, stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the Libertarian Party.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== 19th-century individualist anarchism in the United States ===
{{main article|Individualist anarchism in the United States}}
[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]] like [[Lysander Spooner]] (1808–1887) influenced anarcho-capitalism]]
Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[...] only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by these men. Most had not evolved consciously from this tradition; they had been a rather automatic product of the American environment.&quot; DeLeon, David. ''[[The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism]]''. [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1978, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; (who were also influenced by classical liberalism{{Fact|date=January 2020}}). In the winter of 1949, influenced by several 19th century individualists anarchists, Rothbard decided to reject minimal state ''laissez-faire'' and embrace individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, David. ''The Essential Rothbard''. Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he said: &quot;[[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin R. Tucker]] were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spooner-Tucker Doctrine&quot;&gt;&quot;The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View.&quot; ''A Way Out''. May–June 1965. Later republished in ''Egalitarianism As A Revolt Against Nature''  by Rothbard, 1974. Later published in ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', 2000. [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View]&lt;/ref&gt; He thought they had a faulty understanding of economics as the 19th century individualists had a [[labor theory of value]] as influenced by the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] and Rothbard was a student of [[Austrian Economics|Austrian economics]] which does not agree with the labor theory of value. He sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: &quot;There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;&quot;[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View], Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}} He held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.

Rothbard disagreed with this as he explains in ''The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View''. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Tucker held a labor theory of value and as a result he thought that in a free market people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or &quot;usury&quot; was taking place. As he explains in ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. As an Austrian economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory and believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to [[marginal utility]] rather than to labor amounts in the free market. He did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.

Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of &quot;sovereignty of the individual&quot;, a market economy and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the state. Tucker said: &quot;[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. &quot;Instead of a Book&quot; (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical precedents ==
Several libertarians have discussed historical precedents of what they believe were examples of anarcho-capitalism.

=== Free cities of medieval Europe ===
Economist and libertarian scholar [[Bryan Caplan]] cites the free cities of medieval Europe as important examples of anarchist or nearly anarchistic societies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm|title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2|website=econfaculty.gmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One case that has inspired both sorts of anarchists is that of the free cities of medieval Europe. The first weak link in the chain of feudalism, these free cities became Europe's centers of economic development, trade, art, and culture. They provided a haven for runaway serfs, who could often legally gain their freedom if they avoided re-capture for a year and a day. And they offer many examples of how people can form mutual-aid associations for protection, insurance, and community. Of course, left-anarchists and anarcho-capitalists take a somewhat different perspective on the free cities: the former emphasize the communitarian and egalitarian concerns of the free cities, while the latter point to the relatively unregulated nature of their markets and the wide range of services (often including defense, security, and legal services) which were provided privately or semi-privately.}}

=== Medieval Iceland ===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as David D. Friedman and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society]]
According to the libertarian theorist [[David D. Friedman]]: &quot;Medieval Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-79&quot;&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979). &quot;[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]&quot;. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the legal system of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] comes close to being a real-world anarcho-capitalist legal system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|edition=3rd|pages=203–204|chapter=Private Law Enforcement, Medieval Iceland, and Libertarianism|author=Friedman, David D|isbn= 978-1507785607|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so it provides some evidence of how such a society would function. &quot;Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially 'public' offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman-79&quot;/&gt; Commenting on its political structure, libertarian scholar [[Roderick Long]] remarks:&lt;ref name=&quot;lewrockwell.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/06/roderick-t-long/the-vikings-were-libertarians|title=The Vikings Were Libertarians|publisher=LewRockwell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The legal system's administration, insofar as it had one, lay in the hands of a parliament of about 40 officers whom historians call, however inadequately, &quot;chieftains&quot;. This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year. In addition to their parliamentary role, chieftains were empowered in their own local districts to appoint judges and to keep the peace; this latter job was handled on an essentially fee-for-service basis. The enforcement of judicial decisions was largely a matter of self-help (hence Iceland's reputation as a land of constant private feuding), but those who lacked the might to enforce their rights could sell their court-decreed claims for compensation to someone more powerful, usually a chieftain; hence even the poor and friendless could not be victimized with impunity. The basis of a chieftain's power within the political order was the power he already possessed outside it, in civil society. The office of chieftaincy was private property, and could be bought or sold; hence chieftaincies tended to track private wealth. But wealth alone was not enough. As economic historian Birgir Solvason notes in his masterful study of the period, &quot;just buying the chieftainship was no guarantee of power&quot;; the mere office by itself was &quot;almost worthless&quot; unless the chieftain could &quot;convince some free-farmers to follow him&quot;. Chieftains did not hold authority over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with other chieftains from the same geographical area.}}

Long observes how the system of free contract between farmers and chieftains was threatened when harassment from Norwegian kings that began around AD 1000 forced the people of Iceland to accept Christianity as the national religion, which paved the way for the introduction of a compulsory tax in AD 1096 which was to be paid to the local chieftain who owned a churchstead. This, he believes, gave an unfair advantage to some chieftains who at least in part did not need to rely upon the voluntary support of their clients in order to receive some income. This gradually lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few big chieftains, enabling them to restrict competition and eventually establish effective monopolies. Although the Commonwealth was politically stable for over three centuries,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} longer than any democracy has lasted,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} its eventual downfall was brought about according to Long &quot;not through having too much privatization, but through having too little&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewrockwell.com&quot;/&gt; He notes:

{{quote|[T]he Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament – i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall – while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.}}

=== American Old West ===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that &quot;private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved&quot; and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P.

Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The land clubs and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land.

Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}

According to Anderson, &quot;[d]efining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic.

=== Gaelic Ireland ===
In his work ''[[For a New Liberty]]'', [[Murray Rothbard]] has claimed ancient [[Gaelic Ireland]] as an example of nearly anarcho-capitalist society.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;&gt;M. Rothbard, [https://mises.org/sites/default/files/For%20a%20New%20Liberty%20The%20Libertarian%20Manifesto_3.pdf ''For a New Liberty, The Libertarian Manifesto'']&lt;/ref&gt; In his depiction, citing the work of Professor Joseph Peden,&lt;ref&gt;Peden [https://peacerequiresanarchy.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/stateless-societies-ancient-ireland/ Stateless Societies: Ancient Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; the basic political unit of ancient Ireland was the tuath, which is portrayed as &quot;a body of persons voluntarily united for socially beneficial purposes&quot; with its territorial claim being limited to &quot;the sum total of the landed properties of its members&quot;. Civil disputes were settled by private arbiters called &quot;brehons&quot; and the compensation to be paid to the wronged party was insured through voluntary surety relationships. Commenting on the &quot;kings&quot; of tuaths, Rothbard states:

{{quote|The king was elected by the tuath from within a royal kin-group (the derbfine), which carried the hereditary priestly function. Politically, however, the king had strictly limited functions: he was the military leader of the tuath, and he presided over the tuath assemblies. But he could only conduct war or peace negotiations as agent of the assemblies; and he was in no sense sovereign and had no rights of administering justice over tuath members. He could not legislate, and when he himself was party to a lawsuit, he had to submit his case to an independent judicial arbiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;}}

{{quote|The law merchant, admiralty law, and much of the common law began to be developed by privately competitive judges, who were sought out by litigants for their expertise in understanding the legal areas involved.

== Criticism ==
=== State, justice and defense ===
Many anarchists like [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]] argue that anarcho-capitalism does not in fact get rid of the state. He says that anarcho-capitalists &quot;simply replaced the state with private security firms, and can hardly be described as anarchists as the term is normally understood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Morris, &quot;Global Anti-Capitalism&quot;, pp. 170–176, ''Anarchist Studies'', vol. 14, no. 2, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; As anarchist Peter Sabatini notes:

{{quote|Within [right] Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist vendors&amp;nbsp;... Rothbard sees nothing at all wrong with the amassing of wealth, therefore those with more capital will inevitably have greater coercive force at their disposal, just as they do now.|Peter Sabatini, &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy|title=Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy|author=Peter Sabatini}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likewise, [[Bob Black]] argues that an anarcho-capitalist wants to &quot;abolish the state to his own satisfaction by calling it something else&quot;. He states that they do not denounce what the state does, they just &quot;object to who's doing it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Black (1992), &quot;The Libertarian As Conservative&quot;, ''The Abolition of Work and Other Essays'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that anarcho-capitalism dissolves into [[city states]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarian Alliance&quot;/&gt;

Some critics argue that anarcho-capitalism turns [[justice]] into a commodity; private defense and court firms would favour those who pay more for their services.&lt;ref name=&quot;holcombe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_holcombe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randall G. Holcombe]] argues that defense agencies could form cartels and oppress people without fear of competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;holcombe&quot;/&gt; Philosopher [[Albert Meltzer]] argued that since anarcho-capitalism promotes the idea of private armies, it actually supports a &quot;limited State&quot;. He contends that it &quot;is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Albert|title=Anarchism: Arguments For and Against|publisher=[[AK Press]]|year=2000|page=[https://archive.org/details/anarchism00albe/page/50 50]|isbn=978-1873176573|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anarchism00albe/page/50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Nozick]] argues that a competitive legal system would evolve toward a monopoly government—even without violating individuals rights in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Paul, Fred Dycus Miller (1993). ''Liberalism and the Economic Order''. Cambridge University Press. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', Nozick argues that an anarcho-capitalist society would inevitably transform into a [[night watchman state|minarchist state]] through the eventual emergence of a monopolistic private defense and judicial agency that no longer faces competition. He argues that anarcho-capitalism results in an unstable system that would not endure in the real world. While anarcho-capitalists such as [[Roy Childs]] and [[Murray Rothbard]] have rejected Nozick's arguments,&lt;ref&gt;See Childs's incomplete essay, &quot;Anarchist Illusions&quot;, ''Liberty against Power: Essays by Roy A. Childs, Jr.'', ed. Joan Kennedy Taylor (San Francisco: Fox 1994) 179–183.&lt;/ref&gt; John Jefferson actually advocates Nozick's argument and states that such events would best operate in ''[[laissez-faire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Paul, Fred Dycus Miller (1993). ''Liberalism and the Economic Order. Cambridge University Press. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Birch argues that legal disputes involving several jurisdictions and different legal systems will be too complex and costly, therefore the largest private protection business in a territory will develop into a [[natural monopoly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarian Alliance&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birch|first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Birch (writer) |title=Anarcho-capitalism Dissolves Into City States|journal=Libertarian Alliance|year=1998|volume=no. 28|series=Legal Notes|page=4|url=http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan028.pdf|accessdate=5 July 2010|issn=0267-7083}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Ellickson]] states that anarcho-capitalists &quot;by imagining a stable system of competing private associations, ignore both the inevitability of territorial monopolists in governance, and the importance of institutions to constrain those monopolists' abuses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert C.|last=Ellickson|title=A Hayekian Case Against Anarcho-Capitalism: Of Street Grids, Lighthouses, and Aid to the Destitute|date=26 January 2017|journal=Yale Law &amp; Economics Research Paper No. 569|ssrn=2906383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists counter that this argument is circular because they believe monopolies are artificial constructs that can only be maintained by political immunity to natural market processes, or by perpetual provision of superior quality products and services. Unless competitors are prevented from entering a market, they believe that the profit incentive, which is fueled by &quot;constant demand for improvement&quot;, proportionately draws them into it.&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, they believe that the medieval systems in Ireland and Iceland demonstrate that treating the right to justice as a property means that it is sold (not purchased) by victims.{{non sequitur |date=August 2019}} Some libertarians propose a [[Restorative justice|restitution system of justice]] in which the right to restitution created by the violation of the victims' property could be [[Homestead principle|homesteaded]] by [[bounty hunter]]s that would bring criminals to justice, thus creating the incentive for people to work defending the rights of victims that otherwise would not be able to pay for the service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== Rights and freedom ===
[[Negative and positive rights]] are rights that oblige either action (positive rights) or inaction (negative rights). Anarcho-capitalists believe that negative rights should be recognized as legitimate, but positive rights should be rejected as an intrusion. Some critics reject the distinction between positive and negative rights.&lt;ref&gt;Sterba, James P. (October 1994). &quot;From Liberty to Welfare&quot;. Ethics. Cambridge: Blackwell). 105 (1): 237–241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] also states that the anarcho-capitalist definition of freedom is entirely [[Negative liberty|negative]] and that it cannot guarantee the [[positive freedom]] of individual autonomy and independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;demanding impossible&quot;/&gt;

About anarcho-capitalism, [[Noam Chomsky]] says:

{{quote|Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There isn't the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. The idea of &quot;free contract&quot; between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else.|Noam Chomsky, &quot;On Anarchism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19961223.htm|title=On Anarchism: Noam Chomsky interviewed by Tom Lane|website=chomsky.info|date=23 December 2006|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Economics and property ===
Most anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which violates anarchist principles.&lt;ref name=AFAQinfoshop&gt;{{cite web|title=Section F – Are 'anarcho'-capitalists really anarchists?|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionF1|work=[[An Anarchist FAQ]]|publisher=[[Infoshop.org]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2013|author=Iain McKay|date=21 January 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Graeber]] noted his skepticism about anarcho-capitalism along the same lines:

{{quote|To be honest I'm pretty skeptical about the idea of anarcho-capitalism. If a-caps imagine a world divided into property-holding employers and property-less wage laborers, but with no systematic coercive mechanisms [...] well, I just can't see how it would work. You always see a-caps saying &quot;if I want to hire someone to pick my tomatoes, how are you going to stop me without using coercion?&quot; Notice how you never see anyone say &quot;if I want to hire myself out to pick someone else's tomatoes, how are you going to stop me?&quot; Historically nobody ever did wage labor like that if they had pretty much ANY other option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I am David Graeber, an anthropologist, activist, anarchist and author of Debt. AMA.|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17fi6l/i_am_david_graeber_an_anthropologist_activist/c850ma5?context=3|publisher=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=User-generated content is generally considered unreliable|date=September 2019}}}}

Some critics argue that the anarcho-capitalist concept of voluntary choice ignores constraints due to both human and non-human factors, such as the need for food and shelter, and active restriction of both used and unused resources by those enforcing property claims.&lt;ref name=marketfailure&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=David|title=Market Failure: The Case for and Against Government|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/mps_iceland_talk/Iceland%20MP%20talk.htm|work=Do We Need a Government?|publisher=www.daviddfriedman.com|accessdate=14 July 2010|authorlink=David D. Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person requires employment in order to feed and house himself, the employer–employee relationship could be considered involuntary. Another criticism is that employment is involuntary because the economic system that makes it necessary for some individuals to serve others is supported by the enforcement of coercive private property relations.

Some philosophies view any ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate.&lt;ref name=wendymcelroy&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]] (1995). &quot;[http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libhe/libhe014.htm Intellectual Property: The Late Nineteenth Century Libertarian Debate]&quot;. ''Libertarian Heritage'' No. 14 {{ISBN|1-85637-281-2}}. Retrieved 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some libertarian critics of anarcho-capitalism who support the full privatization of capital, such as [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]], argue that [[Land (economics)|land]] and the raw materials of nature remain a distinct [[Factors of production|factor of production]] and cannot be justly converted to private property because they are not products of human labor. Some [[Socialism|socialists]], including other market anarchists such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], adamantly oppose absentee ownership. Anarcho-capitalists have strong abandonment criteria – one maintains ownership (more or less) until one agrees to trade or gift it. Anti-state critics of this view tend to have comparatively weak abandonment criteria; for example, one loses ownership (more or less) when one stops personally occupying and using it. Furthermore, the idea of perpetually binding original appropriation is anathema to socialism and traditional schools of anarchism as well as to any moral or economic philosophy that takes equal natural rights to land and the Earth's resources as a premise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarian Alliance&quot;/&gt;

On the other hand, anarcho-capitalists believe that the prohibition of private property eliminates the incentives and accountability of ownership and [[Black market|blackens markets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;libertarianpapers&quot;/&gt;

=== Fiction ===
Anarcho-capitalism has been examined in certain works of literature, particularly science fiction. An early example{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} is [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1966 novel ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'' in which he explores what he terms &quot;rational anarchism&quot;.

[[Cyberpunk]] and [[postcyberpunk]] authors have been particularly fascinated by the idea of the breakdown of the nation-state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} Several stories of [[Vernor Vinge]], including ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' and ''[[The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge#Conquest by Default|Conquest by Default]]'', feature anarcho-capitalist societies, sometimes portrayed in a favorable light and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Jim|title=Reviews by Jim Henry: Vernor Vinge|url=http://jimhenry.conlang.org/review/vinge_v.htm|accessdate=Mar 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}} [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', [[Max Barry]]'s ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and [[L. Neil Smith]]'s ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' all explore anarcho-capitalist ideas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The cyberpunk portrayal of anarchy varies from the downright grim to the cheerfully optimistic and it need not imply anything specific about the writer's political views. In particular, Neal Stephenson refrains from sweeping political statements when deliberately provoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/36481.html |title=Neal Stephenson's Past, Present, and Future; The author of the widely praised Baroque Cycle on science, markets, and post-9/11 America |accessdate=11 August 2007 |last=Godwin |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Godwin |author2=Neal Stephenson |date=February 2005 |format=print article |magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810173200/http://www.reason.com/news/show/36481.html |archivedate=10 August 2007 |url-status=dead |author2-link=Neal Stephenson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/20/1518217 |title=Neal Stephenson Responds With Wit and Humor |accessdate=11 August 2007 |author=Roblimo |authorlink= |author2=Neal Stephenson |date=20 October 2004 |format=email exchange |website= |publisher=Slashdot }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Matt Stone's (Richard D. Fuerle) novelette ''On the Steppes of Central Asia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchism.net/steppes.htm |title=On the Steppes of Central Asia |accessdate=10 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an American grad student is invited to work for a newspaper in Mongolia and discovers that the Mongolian society is indeed stateless in a semi-anarcho-capitalist way.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The novelette was originally written to advertise Fuerle's 1986 economics treatise ''The Pure Logic of Choice''.

''Sharper Security: A Sovereign Security Company Novel'', part of a series by Thomas Sewell, is &quot;set a couple of decades into the near-future with a liberty view of society based on individual choice and free market economics&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharper Security Series|url=http://catallaxymedia.com/SharperSecurity|publisher=Catallaxy Media|accessdate=23 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130118231506/http://catallaxymedia.com/SharperSecurity|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features a society where individuals hire a security company to protect and insure them from crime. The security companies are sovereign, but customers are free to switch between them. They behave as a combination of insurance/underwriting and para-military police forces. Anarcho-capitalist themes abound, including an exploration of not honoring sovereign immunity, privately owned road systems, a ''laissez-faire'' market and competing currencies.

[[Sandy Sandfort]]'s, [[Scott Bieser]]'s and [[Lee Oaks]]'s Webcomic ''[[Escape from Terra]]'' examines a market anarchy based on Ceres and its interaction with the aggressive statist society Terra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapefromterra.com/ |title=Big Head Press – Thoughtful Stories, Graphic Novels Online And In Print – Escape From Terra – by Sandy Sandfort, Scott Bieser, Leila Del Duca and Lee Oaks! |publisher=Escape From Terra |accessdate=22 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515145012/http://www.escapefromterra.com/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
