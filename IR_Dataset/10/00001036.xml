'''Aalborg Municipality''' is a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') in [[Region Nordjylland]] on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in northern [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=CVDE&gt;Bridgwater, W. &amp; Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The municipality straddles the [[Limfjord]], the waterway which connects the [[North Sea]] and the [[Kattegat]] east-to-west, and which separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north-to-south. It has a land area of 1,143.99&amp;nbsp;km², population 197,426 (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;FOLK1: Population 1 January&quot;/&gt; and belongs to [[Region Nordjylland]] (&quot;North Jutland Region&quot;).

It is also the name of the municipality's main city [[Aalborg]] and the site of its municipal council, as well as the name of a [[seaport]].

The municipality and the town have chosen to retain the traditional spelling of the name as ''Aalborg'', although the new spelling ''Ålborg'' is used in other contexts, such as Ålborg [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] (''Ålborg Bugt''), the body of water which lies to the east of the Jutland peninsula.

==Municipal reform of 2007==
As of 1 January 2007 Aalborg municipality joined with the municipalities of [[Hals Municipality|Hals]], [[Nibe]], and [[Sejlflod]] to form a new Aalborg municipality. The former Aalborg municipality, including the island of [[Egholm]], covered an area of {{convert|560|km2|abbr=on}}, with a total population of 192,353 (2005).  Its last mayor was Henning G. Jensen, a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]]. The former municipality was bordered by Sejlflod and Hals to the east, [[Dronninglund]] and [[Brønderslev]] to the north, [[Aabybro]] and Nibe to the west, and [[Støvring]] and [[Skørping]] to the south. It belonged to [[North Jutland County]].

==Geography==

===Surroundings===
The waters in the [[Limfjord]] splitting the municipality are called ''Langerak'' to the east and ''[[Gjøl Bredning]]'' to the west.  The island of [[Egholm]] is located in ''Gjøl Bredning'', and is connected by [[ferry]] to the city of Aalborg at its southern shore.

The area is typical for the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake (salt water), with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is [[Store Vildmose]] (&quot;Greater Wild bog&quot;), a swamp where a mirage is sometimes seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar [[Lille Vildmose]] (&quot;Lesser Wild bog&quot;).  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest [[Bog|moor]] in Denmark.

===Urban areas in Aalborg Municipality===
[[Aalborg]] City has a total population at 123,432. The [[metropolitan area]] is a [[conurbation]] of the Aalborg urban area in [[Himmerland]] (102,312) and the [[Nørresundby]] urban area in [[Vendsyssel]] (21,120).
