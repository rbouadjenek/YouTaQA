Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Tach VeTat|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''Antisemitismus'' (&quot;antisemitism&quot;) was first used in print in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' (&quot;Jew-hatred&quot;),{{sfn|Lipstadt|2019|p=22–25}}{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

The origin of &quot;antisemitic&quot; terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: &quot;The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the &quot;Semites&quot; as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=978-0-8386-3252-9 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: &quot;The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how '[[Semitic Race|Semitic races]]' were inferior to '[[Aryan race]]s'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices).

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and &quot;progress&quot; had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase &quot;the Jews are our misfortune&quot; which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term &quot;Semitic&quot; almost synonymously with &quot;Jewish&quot;, in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9780313353840 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9780521774789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to &quot;stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own &quot;antisemitism&quot; and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both &quot;Jewry&quot; (the Jews as a collective) and &quot;jewishness&quot; (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/Marr-Wilhelm-Der-Sieg-des-Judenthums-ueber-das-Germanenthum-2-2 Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet]''. Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word &quot;Semitismus&quot; (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: &quot;Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!&quot; (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!) (p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marr |first=Wilhem |author-link=Wilhelm Marr |url=http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Marr-Text-English.pdf |title=The Victory of Judaism over Germanism: Viewed from a Nonreligious Point of View |translator-first=Gerhard |translator-last=Rohringer |year=1879 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of &quot;[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]&quot; which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', &quot;antisemitism&quot;.

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the &quot;Anti-Kanzler-Liga&quot; (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name=&quot;MZ1987&quot;/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, &quot;In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use (&quot;Allg. Zeit. d. Jud.&quot; 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term &quot;[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]&quot; was used as early as 1881.&lt;ref name=philosemitism&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Jews in Germany|magazine=[[The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art]] (originally [[The Contemporary Review]])|publisher=[[Jonathan Leavitt (publisher)|Leavitt, Trow &amp; Company]]|volume=XXXIII|date=March 1881|page=350|quote=...the position of German Liberals in this matter of philo-Semitism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
From the outset the term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MWdef&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Lipstadt|2019|p=22–25}}&lt;ref name=&quot;JustJews&quot; /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of antisemitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' could be construed as [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages, this is not how the term is commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9781400849567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018|isbn=9781550025538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHRA1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/memo-on-spelling-of-antisemitism_final-1.pdf|title=Memo on Spelling of Antisemitism|publisher=[[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]]|date=April 2015|quote=...the hyphenated spelling allows for the possibility of something called ‘Semitism’, which not only legitimizes a form of pseudo- scientific racial classification that was thoroughly discredited by association with Nazi ideology, but also divides the term, stripping it from its meaning of opposition and hatred toward Jews.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on &quot;the existence of something called 'Semitism'&quot;, &quot;the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (author) |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7EUdvSQs70C&amp;pg=PT421 |isbn=978-0618219087 |pages=628–629 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MZ1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism. It is doubtful whether the term which was first publicizes in an institutional context (the Anti-Semitic League) would have appeared at all if the &quot;Anti-Chancellor League,&quot; which fought Bismarck's policy, had not been in existence since 1875. The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of &quot;anti&quot; and &quot;league,&quot; and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term &quot;Jew&quot; for &quot;Semite&quot; which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form &quot;Sem&quot; is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sevenster1975&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended. Already in 1936 Bolkestein, for example, wrote an article on ''Het &quot;antisemietisme&quot; in de oudheid'' (Anti-Semitism in the ancient world) in which the word was placed between quotation marks and a preference was expressed for the term hatred of the Jews… Nowadays the term anti-Judaism is often preferred. It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, &quot;mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an &quot;umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pogromsriots&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as &quot;a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews.&quot;

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, &quot;Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;pogromsriots&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of &quot;cosmic evil.&quot; Thus, &quot;it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic&quot; unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html &quot;The New Anti-Semitism&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908010822/http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html |date=8 September 2011 }}, ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that &quot;while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses.&quot; For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean &quot;hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.&quot;&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/40258.htm &quot;Report on Global Anti-Semitism&quot;], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: &quot;Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.&quot; It also adds that &quot;such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,&quot; but that &quot;criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.&quot; It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Evolution of usage===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, &quot;Marr, Wilhelm (1819–1904)&quot; in {{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=vol. 2, pp. 445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was &quot;Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet &quot;[[Auto-Emancipation]]&quot;, published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartlett2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

Having analyzed Judeophobia as an hereditary form of demonopathy, peculiar to the human race, and represented Jew-hatred as based upon an inherited aberration of the human mind, we must draw the important conclusion, that we must give up contending against these hostile impulses, just as we give up contending against every other inherited predisposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Leon Pinsker|last1=Pinsker|first1=Leon|translator-last=Blondheim|translator-first=D.S.|title=Auto-Emancipation|date=1906|publisher=The Maccabaean Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=3, 4|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hw5rcs;view=1up;seq=15}}, [[s:Auto-Emancipation|English]] and [https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%98%D7%95-%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%94 Hebrew] translations.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: &quot;The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938. Cited in [[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction''. Harper Collins, 2006, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when &quot;Jew&quot; was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]
Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the &quot;origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods.&quot; König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create &quot;serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Lindbergh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates &quot;economic antisemitism&quot; and merges &quot;political&quot; and &quot;nationalistic&quot; antisemitism into &quot;ideological antisemitism&quot;. Harap also adds a category of &quot;social antisemitism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, &quot;pushy,&quot; vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior &quot;race&quot;),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms &quot;Judeophobia&quot; has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-&quot;Zionism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that &quot;The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a [[political ideology]] that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups which are [[anti-liberalism|opposed to liberalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wisse |first=Ruth |authorlink=Ruth Wisse|url=https://tikvahfund.org/library/podcast-ruth-wisse-on-the-nature-and-functions-of-anti-semitism/ |title=Podcast: Ruth Wisse on the Nature and Functions of Anti-Semitism |publisher=Tikvah |date=17 May 2018 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisse&quot; /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===
Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as &quot;that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, &quot;Jewish&quot; culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of &quot;Jewishness&quot; as a &quot;religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education.&quot; According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing &quot;unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flannery1985&quot;/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, &quot;most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: &quot;The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]].&quot; From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, &quot;the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.&quot;

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial antisemitism, as in his statement that &quot;From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent antisemitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that &quot;are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor&quot;
:b) Jews are &quot;leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination&quot;

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit &quot;their own kind&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as &quot;[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as &quot;scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted&quot;, but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as &quot;clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is &quot;distinct and nearly constant&quot; but theological antisemitism is &quot;often subdued&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of antisemitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded &quot;that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D'Acunto, Francesco, et al.

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism &quot;Anti-Semitism&quot;], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or &quot;Aryans&quot;, were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. &quot;The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.&quot; However, with racial antisemitism, &quot;Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power.&quot; Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to &quot;lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises&quot; while seeking to &quot;exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.

Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;New-AS-List&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and &quot;proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 &quot;Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem&quot;] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New-AS-List&quot;/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: &quot;ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&quot;&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===
The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Flannery1985&quot;/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the &quot;absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]&quot;, making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gruen&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses &quot;in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life.&quot; [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] &quot;not to adore the gods.&quot; Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially &quot;cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flannery1985&quot;/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]], as well as [[Rintfleisch massacres|Rintfleisch knights]] in 1298.

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]].

Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by issuing two [[papal bull]]s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burned alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' (&quot;The greatest epidemics in history&quot;), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[File:Vertreibung der Juden 1614.jpg|thumb|Etching of the [[Frankfurter Judengasse#The Fettmilch Rising|expulsion of the Jews from Frankfurt]] in 1614]]
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed.&quot; [http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/religion/judaism/timeline.html Judaism Timeline 1618–1770], [[CBS News]].

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ.

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called &quot;protected&quot; Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the &quot;protected&quot; Jews had an alternative to &quot;either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]&quot; (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that &quot;Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution.&quot;

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s &quot;Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. &quot;Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence.&quot; Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H.

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish &quot;financial aristocracy&quot; along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a &quot;deicidal people&quot; driven by hatred to &quot;enslave&quot; Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael1&quot; /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a &quot;Bible of modern antisemitism&quot; and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael1&quot; /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner].

[[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the &quot;black czar&quot; and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that &quot;One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: &quot;I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.&quot;&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: &quot;…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt….&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
[[File:L Agitation-Antisemite.jpg|thumb|Anti-Semitic agitators in Paris burn an effigy of Mathieu Dreyfus during the [[Dreyfus affair]]]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called &quot;the inventor of modern antisemitism&quot;&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly &quot;German&quot; art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

{{quote|According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;}}

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in &quot;The Good Bargain&quot; (&quot;''Der gute Handel&quot;'') and &quot;[[The Jew Among Thorns]]&quot; (''&quot;Der Jude im Dorn&quot;'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe.

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented modern incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]]s in Europe. During the [[Russian Civil War]], close to 50,000 Jews were killed in pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Russian_Civil_War|title=Russian Civil War|last=Abramson|first=Henry|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that &quot;in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americaitsjewsri00arad/page/174 174] |url=https://archive.org/details/americaitsjewsri00arad/page/174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was &quot;more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized&quot;. The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In Germany, [[Nazism]] led [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], who [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights.{{sfn|Majer|2014|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (7 April 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between &quot;Aryans&quot; and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (&quot;race disgrace&quot;) and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became &quot;subjects of the state&quot;).{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

After [[Operation Barbarossa|the beginning]] of the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder, conducted by the [[Einsatzgruppen]], culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic [[genocide]]: [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;saul1&quot;&gt;[[Saul Friedländer]] (2008): ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews''.

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s.

Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA9 Page 9] in: {{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes|author=Bernard Lazare|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=9781596056015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in [[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|stereotypes of Jews]]), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of [[Moneylender|money lending]] was operated by Jews.&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaloAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=154 Page 154] in: {{cite book|title=The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day|author=Walter Laqueur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199774739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions,&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006/&gt; while the [[Christian Church]] declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral &quot;[[usury]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hawthorne's secret: an un-told tale|jstor=41398742|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=38|issue=3|pages=664–666|author=Philip Young|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Libya =====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930s, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews canceled.

===== Morocco =====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}
[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morocco&quot;&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand per year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021224192927/http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

===== Tunisia =====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}
Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a suicide bombing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrucci|first=Filippo|last2=Fois|first2=Marisa|date=2016-03-03|title=Attitudes towards Israel in Tunisian political debate: from Bourguiba to the new constitution|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=21|issue=3|pages=392–410|doi=10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|issn=1362-9387}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]].

In modern-day Tunisia, there have been many instances of antisemitic acts and statements. Since the government is not quick to condemn them, antisemitism spreads throughout Tunisian society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Israeli|first=Raphael|chapter=Anti-Semitism under the Guise of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Israelism|pages=149–189|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315124933|doi=10.4324/9781315124933-6|title=Muslim Anti-Semitism in Christian Europe|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Ben Ali regime, there have been an increasing number of public offenses against Jews in Tunisia. For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted &quot;Death to the Jews&quot; as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheik told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist antisemitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In response to the prevalent antisemitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

===== South Africa =====
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}
Antisemitism has been present in the history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that &quot;Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism,&quot; and &quot;Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Algemeiner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Wins Iranian Festival Prize|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/11/anti-semitic-cartoon-wins-iranian-festival-prize/|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Algemeiner|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocker|first=Simon|title=Iran gives antisemitic cartoon top prize|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/69827/iran-gives-antisemitic-cartoon-top-prize|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Declared Winner Of Iranian 'Wall Street Downfall' Festival|url=http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|website=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111113637/http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|archive-date=11 January 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = &quot;mgjmsp&quot; /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = &quot;mgjmsp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119121332/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm |date=19 November 2012 }}, The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a &quot;tsunami of antisemitism&quot; was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: &quot;A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, &quot;We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall.&quot; He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of [[incitement]], as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand [[terrorist]] and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|last=Shamee|first=Maureen|title='Proactive' response needed to escalation of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, says European Jewish Congress|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=European Jewish Press|date=6 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105102040/http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|archive-date=5 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the &quot;Jewish banker class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israel's Ambassador to Ukraine, the antisemitism occurs here much less frequently than in other European countries, and has more a hooligan's nature rather than a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Посол Ізраїлю заперечив, що в Україні є &quot;системний антисемітизм&quot;|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2016/01/19/7095928/|website=Ukrayinska Pravda|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antisemitism report for 2017 that Israel's [[Ministry of Diaspora Affairs]] under [[Naftali Bennett]] published in January 2018 stated that &quot;A striking exception in the trend of decrease in antisemitic incidents in Eastern Europe was Ukraine, where the number of recorded antisemitic attacks was doubled from last year and surpassed the tally for all the incidents reported throughout the entire region combined.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report 2017: Ukraine had more antisemitic cases than all former USSR countries combined |url=https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Antisemitism/Report-Ukraine-had-more-antisemitic-incidents-than-all-former-Soviet-countries-combined-540096 |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often &quot;praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s&quot;, that &quot;Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students&quot; and that &quot;Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]&quot;. Additionally, &quot;while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews&quot;, saying that it says in &quot;the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews&quot;. Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly &quot;to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted &quot;Hitler&quot; in the streets.

In 2017 an [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]] survey found that the levels of antisemitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple antisemitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41241353 |title=Over a quarter of British people 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes', study finds |last=May |first=Callum |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpr-201709&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf |title=Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain |author=L.

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campaign Against Antisemitism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antisemitism.uk/crime|title=National Antisemitic Crime Audit|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=1 May 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: &quot;Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campaign Against Antisemitism&quot;/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, [[far-left antisemitism]] and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006.

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the &quot;ADL Global 100&quot;, a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that &quot;Jews have too much power in the business world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published.

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a &quot;distinctive religious symbol&quot; was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon.

The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes.

The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, &quot;with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.&quot; The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720070101/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ |date=20 July 2012 }}.

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, &quot;While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions.
