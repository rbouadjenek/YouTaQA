From 1939 to 1945, following its forced division and partial incorporation into [[Nazi Germany]], the state did not ''de facto'' exist but [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|its government-in-exile]] continued to operate.

From 1948 to 1990, Czechoslovakia was part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with a [[command economy]]. Its economic status was formalized in membership of [[Comecon]] from 1949 and its defense status in the [[Warsaw Pact]] of May 1955. A period of political liberalization in 1968, known as the [[Prague Spring]], was forcibly ended when the Soviet Union, assisted by several other Warsaw Pact countries, [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]] Czechoslovakia. In 1989, as [[Marxist–Leninist]] governments and [[socialism]] were [[Revolutions of 1989|ending]] all over Europe, Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the [[Velvet Revolution]]; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the two sovereign states of the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].

==Characteristics==
;Form of state
*1918 – 1938: A [[democratic republic]] championed by [[Tomáš Masaryk]].
*1938 – 1939: After annexation of [[Sudetenland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938, the region gradually turned into a state with loosened connections among the Czech, Slovak, and Ruthenian parts. A large strip of southern Slovakia and [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] was annexed by Hungary, and the [[Teschen conflict|Zaolzie region]] was annexed by Poland.
*1939 – 1945: The region was split into the '''[[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]''' and the '''[[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]]'''. A [[Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|government-in-exile]] continued to exist in London, supported by the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and their [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]; after the [[German invasion of Soviet Union]], it was also recognized by the [[Soviet Union]]. Czechoslovakia adhered to the [[Declaration by United Nations]] and was a founding member of the [[United Nations]].
*1946 – 1948: The country was governed by a [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|coalition government]] with [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|communist]] ministers, including the prime minister and the minister of interior. [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was ceded to the Soviet Union.
*1948 – 1989: The country became a [[Marxist-Leninist state]] under [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet domination]] with a [[command economy]]. In 1960, the country officially became a socialist republic, the '''[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]'''. It was a [[satellite state]] of the [[Soviet Union]].
*1989 – 1990: The [[federal republic]] consisted of the '''[[Czech Socialist Republic]]''' and the '''[[Slovak Socialist Republic]]'''.
*1990 – 1992: Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], the state was renamed the '''[[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic]]''', consisting of the Czech Republic (Czechia) and the Slovak Republic (Slovakia), and reverted to a democratic republic.

;Neighbours
*[[Austria]] 1918 – 1938, 1945 – 1992
*[[Germany]] (Both predecessors, [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], were neighbors between 1949 and 1990.)
*[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]
*[[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]
*[[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] 1918 – 1938
*[[Soviet Union]] 1945 – 1991
*[[Ukraine]] 1991 – 1992 ([[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Union member]] until 1991)
;Topography
The country was of generally irregular terrain. The western area was part of the north-central European uplands. The eastern region was composed of the northern reaches of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and lands of the [[Danube River]] basin.

;Climate

The area was long a part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] until the empire collapsed at the end of [[World War I]]. The new state was founded by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|year=1933|title=Czechs Celebrate Republic's Birth, 1933/11/06 (1933)|url=https://archive.org/details/1933-11-06_Czechs_Celebrate_Republics_Birth|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=22 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407122843/https://archive.org/details/1933-11-06_Czechs_Celebrate_Republics_Birth|archivedate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1850–1937), who served as its first president from 14 November 1918 to 14 December 1935. He was succeeded by his close ally, [[Edvard Beneš]] (1884–1948).

The roots of Czech nationalism go back to the 19th century, when philologists and educators, influenced by [[Romanticism]], promoted the [[Czech language]] and pride in the [[Czech people]]. Nationalism became a mass movement in the second half of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the limited opportunities for participation in political life under Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as historian [[František Palacký]] (1798–1876) founded many patriotic, self-help organizations which provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life prior to independence. Palacký supported [[Austro-Slavism]] and worked for a reorganized and federal Austrian Empire, which would protect the Slavic speaking peoples of Central Europe against Russian and German threats.

An advocate of democratic reform and Czech autonomy within Austria-Hungary, Masaryk was elected twice to the ''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'' (Austrian Parliament), first from 1891 to 1893 for the [[Young Czech Party]], and again from 1907 to 1914 for the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1889 with [[Karel Kramář]] and [[Josef Kaizl]].

During World War I small numbers of Czechs and Slovaks, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]], fought with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in France and Italy, while large numbers deserted to Russia in exchange for its support for the independence of Czechoslovakia from the Austrian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;PRECLÍK, Vratislav.

With Edvard Beneš and [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]], Masaryk visited several Western countries and won support from influential publicists.&lt;ref&gt;Z. A. B. Zeman, ''The Masaryks: The Making of Czechoslovakia'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Czechoslovak Republic===
{{main|First Czechoslovak Republic}}

====Formation====
[[File:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]
The [[Bohemian Kingdom]] ceased to exist in 1918 when it was incorporated into Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was founded in October 1918, as one of the successor states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of [[World War I]] and as part of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. It consisted of the present day territories of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], Slovakia and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. Its territory included some of the most industrialized regions of the former Austria-Hungary.

==== Ethnicity ====
{{see also|Ethnic minorities in Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]

The new country was a multi-ethnic state, with Czechs and Slovaks as ''constituent peoples''. The population consisted of [[Czechs]] (51%), [[Slovaks]] (16%), [[Germans]] (22%), [[Hungarians]] (5%) and [[Rusyns]] (4%).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The War of the World&quot;, [[Niall Ferguson]] Allen Lane 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles&lt;ref name=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |title=Playing the blame game |accessdate=30 June 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630084718/http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |archivedate=30 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}, ''[[Prague Post]]'', 6 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This policy led to unrest among the non-Czech population, particularly in German-speaking [[Sudetenland]], which initially had proclaimed itself part of the [[Republic of German-Austria]] in accordance with the self-determination principle.

The state proclaimed the official ideology that there were no separate Czech and Slovak nations, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see [[Czechoslovakism]]), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II (after the country had been divided during the war), the conflict between the [[Czechs]] and the [[Slovaks]] surfaced again. The governments of Czechoslovakia and other eastern European nations deported ethnic Germans to the West, reducing the presence of minorities in the nation. Most of the Jews had been killed during the war by the Nazis and their allies.

====Interwar period====
During the period between the two world wars, democracy thrived in Czechoslovakia. Of all the new states established in central Europe after 1918, only Czechoslovakia preserved a democratic government until the war broke out. Thus, despite regional disparities, its level of development was much higher than that of neighboring states.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The population was generally literate, and contained fewer alienated groups. The influence of these conditions was augmented by the political values of Czechoslovakia's leaders and the policies they adopted. Under [[Tomas Masaryk]], Czech and Slovak politicians promoted progressive social and economic conditions that served to defuse discontent.

Foreign minister Beneš became the prime architect of the Czechoslovak-Romanian-Yugoslav alliance (the &quot;[[Little Entente]]&quot;, 1921–38) directed against Hungarian attempts to reclaim lost areas. Beneš worked closely with France. Far more dangerous was the German element, which after 1933 became allied with the Nazis in Germany. The increasing feeling of inferiority among the Slovaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nazis-take-czechoslovakia|title=Nazis take Czechoslovakia|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were hostile to the more numerous Czechs, weakened the country in the late 1930s. Many Slovaks supported an extreme nationalist movement and welcomed the puppet Slovak state set up under Hitler's control in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Czechoslovak Republic (1939).svg|thumb|Territory of the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic]] (1938–1939)]]

In September 1938, [[Adolf Hitler]] demanded control of the [[Sudetenland]]. On 29 September 1938, Britain and France ceded control in the [[Appeasement]] at the [[Munich Conference]]; France ignored the military alliance it had with Czechoslovakia. During October 1938, [[Nazi Germany]] occupied and annexed the Sudetenland border region, effectively crippling Czechoslovak defences.

On 15 March 1939, the remainder (&quot;rump&quot;) of Czechoslovakia was invaded and divided into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the puppet [[Slovak State]].

Much of Slovakia and all of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] were annexed by Hungary. Poland [[Teschen conflict|occupied]] Zaolzie, an area whose population was majority Polish, in October 1938.

The eventual goal of the German state under Nazi leadership was to eradicate Czech nationality through assimilation, deportation, and extermination of the Czech intelligentsia; the intellectual elites and middle class made up a considerable number of the 200,000 people who passed through concentration camps and the 250,000 who died during German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;''Universities in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (1800–1945), Walter Rüegg Cambridge University Press (28 October 2004), page 353&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Generalplan Ost]], it was assumed that around 50% Czechs would be fit for [[Germanization]]. The Czech intellectual elites were to be removed not only from Czech territories but from Europe completely. The authors of Generalplan Ost believed it would be best if they emigrated overseas, as even in [[Siberia]] they were considered a threat to German rule. Just like Jews, Poles, Serbs, and several other nations, Czechs were considered to be [[untermenschen]] by the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=HITLER'S PLANS FOR EASTERN EUROPE Selections from Janusz Gumkowski and Kazimierz Leszczynski POLAND UNDER NAZI OCCUPATION |accessdate=13 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012554/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm|archivedate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, in a secret Nazi plan for the Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia it was declared that those considered to be of racially Mongoloid origin and the Czech intelligentsia were not to be Germanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/nca/nca-01/nca-01-13-spoliation-02.html| title= Nazi Conspiracy &amp; Aggression Volume I Chapter XIII Germanization &amp; Spoliation Czechoslovakia| access-date= 27 September 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150928022926/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/nca/nca-01/nca-01-13-spoliation-02.html| archive-date= 28 September 2015| url-status= live| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportation of Jews to concentration camps was organized under the direction of [[Reinhard Heydrich]], and the fortress town of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]] was made into a ghetto way station for Jewish families. On 4 June 1942 Heydrich died after being wounded by an assassin in [[Operation Anthropoid]]. Heydrich's successor, Colonel General [[Kurt Daluege]], ordered mass arrests and executions and the destruction of the villages of [[Lidice]] and [[Ležáky]]. In 1943 the German war effort was accelerated. Under the authority of [[Karl Hermann Frank]], German minister of state for Bohemia and Moravia, some 350,000 Czech laborers were dispatched to the Reich. Within the protectorate, all non-war-related industry was prohibited. Most of the Czech population obeyed quiescently up until the final months preceding the end of the war, while thousands were involved in the [[resistance movement]].

For the Czechs of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] was a period of brutal oppression. Czech losses resulting from political persecution and deaths in concentration camps totaled between 36,000 and 55,000. The Jewish population of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] (118,000 according to the 1930 census) was virtually annihilated. Many Jews emigrated after 1939; more than 70,000 were killed; 8,000 survived at Terezín. Several thousand Jews managed to live in freedom or in hiding throughout the occupation.

Despite the estimated 136,000 deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime, the population in the Reichsprotektorate saw a net increase during the war years of approximately 250,000 in line with an increased birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vaclav Havel – A Political Tragedy in 6 Acts&quot; by John Keane, published 2000, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 1945, the third US Army of General Patton entered Pilsen from the south west. On 9 May 1945, Soviet Red Army troops entered Prague.

===Socialist Czechoslovakia===
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|Czechoslovak Socialist Republic}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1961-1989).svg|thumb|upright|Socialist [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|coat of arms]] in 1960–1990]]

After World War II, pre-war Czechoslovakia was re-established, with the exception of Sub[[carpathian Ruthenia]], which was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The [[Beneš decrees]] were promulgated concerning ethnic Germans (see [[Potsdam Agreement]]) and ethnic Hungarians. Under the decrees, [[citizenship]] was abrogated for people of German and Hungarian [[ethnic origin]] who had accepted German or Hungarian citizenship during the occupations. In 1948, this provision was cancelled for the Hungarians, but only partially for the Germans. The government then confiscated the property of the Germans and [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled about 90% of the ethnic German population]], over 2 million people. Those who remained were [[Collective accountability|collectively accused]] of supporting the Nazis after the [[Munich Agreement]], as 97.32% of Sudeten Germans had voted for the [[NSDAP]] in the December 1938 elections. Almost every decree explicitly stated that the sanctions did not apply to antifascists. Some 250,000 Germans, many married to Czechs, some antifascists, and also those required for the post-war reconstruction of the country, remained in Czechoslovakia. The Beneš Decrees still cause controversy among nationalist groups in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol11num1_2/special/rupnik.html East European Constitutional Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515002848/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol11num1_2/special/rupnik.html |date=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spartakiáda - 1960.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Spartakiad (Czechoslovakia)|Spartakiad]]'' in 1960]]

[[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (Podkarpatská Rus) was occupied by (and in June 1945 formally ceded to) the Soviet Union. In the 1946 parliamentary election, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] was the winner in the [[Czech lands]], and the [[Democratic Party (Slovakia, 1944)|Democratic Party]] won in Slovakia. In February 1948 the Communists seized power. Although they would maintain the fiction of political pluralism through the existence of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]], except for a short period in the late 1960s (the [[Prague Spring]]) the country had no [[liberal democracy]]. Since citizens lacked significant electoral methods of registering protest against government policies, periodically there were street protests that became violent. For example, there were riots in the town of [[Plzeň uprising of 1953|Plzeň in 1953]], reflecting economic discontent. Police and army units put down the rebellion, and hundreds were injured but no one was killed. While its economy remained more advanced than those of its neighbors in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia grew increasingly economically weak relative to Western Europe.

The currency reform of 1953 caused dissatisfaction among Czechoslovak laborers.  Prior to World War II, the Czech purchasing power surpassed that of the Soviet Union by 115-144%.  This disparity was noted after Czechoslovakia came under the [[Soviet Bloc]]. To equalize the wage rate, Czechoslovaks had to turn in their old money for new at a decreased value. This lowered the real value of wages by about 11%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Vaclav|date=June 1954|title=Czechoslovakia under Communism|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banks also confiscated savings and bank deposits to control the amount of money in circulation.  The economy continued to suffer as production achievements of bituminous coal was less than anticipated.  Bituminous coal powered 85% of Czechoslovakia's economy.  Because of low production, coal was utilized in industry only.  Pre-war years, consumers used both coal and lignite for fuel, however due to low production, coal was for industrial use only which meant the consumer was only able to utilize lignite.  In 1929, a typical family of four consumed approximately 2.34 tons of lignite, but by 1953 it was allowed to use only 1.6-1.8 tons per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Czechoslovakia.png|thumb|Czechoslovakia after 1969]]

In 1968, when the reformer [[Alexander Dubček]] was appointed to the key post of First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, there was a brief period of liberalization known as the [[Prague Spring]]. In response, after failing to persuade the Czechoslovak leaders to change course, five other [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|members of the Warsaw Pact invaded]]. Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia on the night of 20–21 August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/N.-Korea-Seize-U.S.-Ship/12303153093431-9/#title &quot;Russia Invades Czechoslovakia: 1968 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831120907/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/N.-Korea-Seize-U.S.-Ship/12303153093431-9/#title |date=31 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soviet Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] viewed this intervention as vital for the preservation of the Soviet, socialist system and vowed to intervene in any state that sought to replace [[Marxism-Leninism]] with [[Capitalism (Marxism)|capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (New York: The Penguin Press), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In the week after the invasion there was a spontaneous campaign of [[civil resistance]] against the occupation. This resistance involved a wide range of acts of non-cooperation and defiance: this was followed by a period in which the Czechoslovak Communist Party leadership, having been forced in Moscow to make concessions to the Soviet Union, gradually put the brakes on their earlier liberal policies.&lt;ref&gt;Philip WIndsor and [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], ''Czechoslovakia 1968: Reform, Repression and Resistance'' (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1969), pp. 97–143.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1969 Dubček was finally dismissed from the First Secretaryship of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Meanwhile, one plank of the reform program had been carried out: in 1968–69, Czechoslovakia was turned into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. The theory was that under the federation, social and economic inequities between the Czech and Slovak halves of the state would be largely eliminated. A number of ministries, such as education, now became two formally equal bodies in the two formally equal republics. However, the centralized political control by the Czechoslovak Communist Party severely limited the effects of federalization.

The 1970s saw the rise of the dissident movement in Czechoslovakia, represented among others by [[Václav Havel]]. The movement sought greater political participation and expression in the face of official disapproval, manifested in limitations on work activities, which went as far as a ban on professional employment, the refusal of higher education for the dissidents' children, police harassment and prison.

===After 1989===
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1989–1992)}}
[[File:Foundation of the Visegrád Group.tiff|thumb|The [[Visegrád Group]] signing ceremony in February 1991]]

In 1989, the [[Velvet Revolution]] restored [[democracy]]. This occurred at around the same time as the fall of communism in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.

The word &quot;socialist&quot; was removed from the country's full name on 29 March 1990 and replaced by &quot;federal&quot;.

In 1992, because of growing [[nationalist]] tensions in the government, Czechoslovakia was [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]] by parliament. On 1 January 1993 it formally separated into two independent countries, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Politics of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After World War II, a political monopoly was held by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ). [[Gustáv Husák]] was elected first secretary of the KSČ in 1969 (changed to general secretary in 1971) and president of Czechoslovakia in 1975. Other parties and organizations existed but functioned in subordinate roles to the KSČ. All political parties, as well as numerous mass organizations, were grouped under umbrella of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]]. Human rights activists and religious activists were severely repressed.

Czechoslovakia had the following constitutions during its history (1918–1992):
*Temporary constitution of 14 November 1918 (democratic): see [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)]]
*The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]] (The Constitutional Document of the Czechoslovak Republic), democratic, in force until 1948, several amendments
*The Communist 1948 [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]]
*The Communist [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia|1960 Constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] with major amendments in 1968 ([[Constitutional Law of Federation]]), 1971, 1975, 1978, and 1989 (at which point the leading role of the Communist Party was abolished). It was amended several more times during 1990–1992 (for example, 1990, name change to Czecho-Slovakia, 1991 incorporation of the human rights charter)

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia}}
*1918–1923: Different systems in former Austrian territory ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], a small part of [[Silesia]]) compared to former Hungarian territory (Slovakia and [[Ruthenia]]): three lands (''země'') (also called district units (''kraje'')): Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, plus 21 counties (''župy'') in today's Slovakia and three counties in today's Ruthenia; both lands and counties were divided into districts (''[[okres]]y'').
*1923–1927: As above, except that the Slovak and Ruthenian counties were replaced by six (grand) counties (''(veľ)župy'') in Slovakia and one (grand) county in Ruthenia, and the numbers and boundaries of the ''okresy'' were changed in those two territories.
*1928–1938: Four lands (Czech: ''země'', Slovak: ''krajiny''): Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia, divided into districts (''okresy'').
*Late 1938 – March 1939: As above, but Slovakia and Ruthenia gained the status of &quot;autonomous lands&quot;. Slovakia was called ''Slovenský štát'', with its own currency and government.
*1945–1948: As in 1928–1938, except that Ruthenia became part of the Soviet Union.
*1949–1960: 19 regions (''kraje'') divided into 270 ''okresy''.
*1960–1992: 10 ''kraje'', [[Prague]], and (from 1970) [[Bratislava]] (capital of Slovakia); these were divided into 109–114 okresy; the kraje were abolished temporarily in Slovakia in 1969–1970 and for many purposes from 1991 in Czechoslovakia; in addition, the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic were established in 1969 (without the word ''Socialist'' from 1990).

==Population and ethnic groups==
{{Main|Demographics of Czechoslovakia}}

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Czechoslovakia}}
Before World War II, the economy was about the fourth in all industrial states in Europe. The state was based on strong economy, manufacturing cars ([[Škoda Auto|Škoda]], [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]), trams, aircraft ([[Aero Vodochody|Aero]], [[Avia]]), ships, ship engines ([[Škoda Works|Škoda]]), canons, shoes ([[Bata Shoes|Baťa]]), turbines, guns ([[Zbrojovka Brno]]). It was the industrial workshop for Austro-Hungarian empire. The Slovak lands were more in agriculture.

After World War II, the economy was centrally planned, with command links controlled by the communist party, similarly to the [[Soviet Union]]. The large metallurgical industry was dependent on imports of iron and non-ferrous ores.
*Industry: Extractive industry and manufacturing dominated the sector, including machinery, chemicals, food processing, metallurgy, and textiles. The sector was wasteful in its use of energy, materials, and labor and was slow to upgrade technology, but the country was a major supplier of high-quality machinery, instruments, electronics, aircraft, airplane engines and arms to other socialist countries.
*Agriculture: Agriculture was a minor sector, but collectivized farms of large acreage and relatively efficient mode of production enabled the country to be relatively self-sufficient in food supply. The country depended on imports of grains (mainly for livestock feed) in years of adverse weather. Meat production was constrained by shortage of feed, but the country still recorded high per capita consumption of meat.
*Foreign trade: Exports were estimated at US$17.8 billion in 1985. Exports were machinery (55%), fuel and materials (14%), and manufactured consumer goods (16%). Imports stood at estimated US$17.9 billion in 1985, including fuel and materials (41%), machinery (33%), and agricultural and forestry products (12%). In 1986, about 80% of foreign trade was with other socialist countries.
*Exchange rate: Official, or commercial, rate was crowns (Kčs) 5.4 per US$1 in 1987. Tourist, or non-commercial, rate was Kčs 10.5 per US$1. Neither rate reflected purchasing power. The exchange rate on the [[black market]] was around Kčs 30 per US$1, which became the official rate once the currency became convertible in the early 1990s.
*Fiscal year: Calendar year.
*Fiscal policy: The state was the exclusive owner of means of production in most cases. Revenue from state enterprises was the primary source of revenues followed by [[turnover tax]]. The government spent heavily on social programs, subsidies, and investment. Budget was usually balanced or left small surplus.

==Resource base==
{{Main|Resource base of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After World War II, the country was short of energy, relying on imported [[crude oil]] and natural gas from Soviet Union, domestic [[Lignite|brown coal]], and [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[hydroelectric energy]]. Energy constraints were a major factor in the 1980s.

==Transport and communications==
{{Main|Transport in Czechoslovakia}}
{{section expand|date=September 2016}}
Slightly after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, there was a lack of needful infrastructure in many areas – paved roads, railways, bridges etc. Massive improvement in the following years enabled Czechoslovakia to develop its industry. Prague's civil airport in Ruzyně became one of the most modern terminals in the world, when it was finished in 1937. [[Tomáš Baťa]], Czech entrepreneur and visionary outlined his ideas in the publication &quot;Budujme stát pro 40 milionů lidí&quot;, where he described the future motorway system. Construction of the first motorways in Czechoslovakia begun in 1939, nevertheless, they were stopped after Nazi occupation during the World War II.

==Society==
{{Main|Society of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Czechoslovakia}}

Education was free at all levels and compulsory from age 6 to 15. The vast majority of the population was literate. There was a highly developed system of apprenticeship training and vocational schools supplemented general secondary schools and institutions of higher education.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Czechoslovakia}}
In 1991: [[Roman Catholics]] 46%, [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheran]] 5.3%, [[Atheist]] 30%, n/a 17%, but there were huge differences in religious practices between the two constituent republics; see Czech Republic and Slovakia.

==Health, social welfare and housing==
{{Main|Health and social welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After World War II, [[Universal healthcare|free health care]] was available to all citizens. National health planning emphasised preventive medicine; factory and local health care centres supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. There was substantial improvement in rural health care during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Mass media==
{{Main|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia}}

During the era between the World Wars, Czechoslovak democracy and liberalism facilitated conditions for free publication. The most significant daily newspapers in these times were Lidové noviny, Národní listy, Český deník and Československá republika.

During Communist rule, the mass media in Czechoslovakia were controlled by the Communist Party. Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this information monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were [[Censorship|reviewed]] by the government's Office for Press and Information.

==Sports==
{{see also|Czechoslovakia at the Olympics}}
The [[Czechoslovakia national football team]] was a consistent performer on the international scene, with eight appearances in the [[FIFA World Cup]] Finals, finishing in second place in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]. The team also won the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976]], came in third in [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]] and won the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold]] in [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]].

Well-known football players such as [[Pavel Nedvěd]], [[Antonín Panenka]], [[Milan Baroš]], [[Tomáš Rosický]], [[Vladimír Šmicer]] or [[Petr Čech]] were all born in Czechoslovakia.

The [[International Olympic Committee]] code for Czechoslovakia is TCH, which is still used in historical listings of results.

The [[Czechoslovak national ice hockey team]] won many medals from the world championships and Olympic Games. [[Peter Šťastný]], [[Jaromír Jágr]], [[Dominik Hašek]], [[Peter Bondra]], [[Petr Klíma]], [[Marián Gáborík]], [[Marián Hossa]], [[Miroslav Šatan]] and [[Pavol Demitra]] all come from Czechoslovakia.

[[Emil Zátopek]], winner of four Olympic gold medals in [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], is considered one of the top athletes in Czechoslovak history.

[[Věra Čáslavská]] was an Olympic gold medallist in gymnastics, winning seven gold medals and four silver medals. She represented Czechoslovakia in three consecutive Olympics.

Several accomplished professional [[tennis]] players including [[Ivan Lendl]], [[Jan Kodeš]], [[Miloslav Mečíř]], [[Hana Mandlíková]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Jana Novotna]], [[Petra Kvitová]] and [[Daniela Hantuchová]] were born in Czechoslovakia.
