It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|8th most extensive]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|21st most populous]] U.S. state. The estimated population of Colorado is 5,770,545 as of 2019, an increase of 14.7% since the [[2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEstUS&quot;/&gt;

The state was named for the [[Colorado River]], which [[Conquistador#North America exploration|early Spanish explorers]] named the ''Río Colorado'' (&quot;Red River&quot;) for the [[wikt:ruddy|ruddy]] [[silt]] the river carried from the mountains. The [[Territory of Colorado]] was organized on February 28, 1861,&lt;ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/&gt; and on August 1, 1876, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state.&lt;ref name=ColoradoStatehoodProclamation/&gt; Colorado is nicknamed the &quot;[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]&quot; because it became a state one century after the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Colorado is bordered by [[Wyoming]] to the north, [[Nebraska]] to the northeast, [[Kansas]] to the east, [[Oklahoma]] to the southeast, [[New Mexico]] to the south, [[Utah]] to the west, and touches [[Arizona]] to the southwest at the [[Four Corners]]. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], mesas, canyons, [[plateau]]s, rivers and desert lands. Colorado is part of the [[Western United States|western]] and [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] United States and is one of the [[Mountain States]].

[[Denver]] is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[Colorado municipalities by population|most populous city]] of Colorado.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Colorado}}
[[File:Colorado geographic map-en.svg|upright=1.13|thumb|Map of Colorado]]
Colorado is notable for its diverse [[geography]], which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. In 1861, the [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress|United States Congress]] defined the boundaries of the new [[Territory of Colorado]] exclusively by lines of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], stretching from [[37th parallel north|37°N]] to [[41st parallel north|41°N]] latitude, and from [[25th meridian west from Washington|102°02'48&quot;W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|109°02'48&quot;W]] longitude ([[25th meridian west from Washington|25°W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|32°W]] from the [[Washington Meridian]]).&lt;ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/36th-congress/session-2/c36s2ch59.pdf|title=An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado|format=PDF|publisher=[[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]]|date=February 28, 1861|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After {{age|1861|02|28}} years of government surveys, the borders of Colorado are now officially defined by 697 [[boundary marker]]s and 697 [[Border|straight boundary lines]].&lt;ref name=FM&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fascinating Maps|title=Colorado is NOT a perfect rectangle|url=https://fascinatingmaps.com/colorado-is-not-a-perfect-rectangle/|accessdate=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617202941/https://fascinatingmaps.com/colorado-is-not-a-perfect-rectangle/|archive-date=June 17, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado, [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] are the only states that have their borders defined solely by straight boundary lines with no natural features.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Big Think, Inc.|title=Colorado is a rectangle?

[[File:Calhanpm.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Calhan Paint Mines]] on the Colorado Eastern Plains]]

===Plains===
A little less than half of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains are the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the section of the Great Plains within Nebraska at elevations ranging from roughly {{convert|3350|to|7500|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/colorado-county-highpoints/532245|title=Colorado County Highpoints|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colorado plains are mostly prairies but also include [[deciduous forests]], [[butte]]s, and canyons. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] averages {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm}} annually.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php|title=Climate of Colorado|last1=Doesken|first1=Nolan J.|last2=Pielke|first2=Roger A., Sr.|authorlink2=Roger A.

Eastern Colorado is presently mainly farmland and rangeland, along with small farming villages and towns. Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.

===Front Range===
[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]

Roughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The &quot;Front Range&quot; includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in Western Colorado (which is not considered the &quot;Front Range&quot;) are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].

===Continental Divide===
[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]
The [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

===Southern region===
[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]] in southern Colorado]]
In southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.
[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]

===Peaks===
{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}
To the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round.

Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.

===Colorado Western Slope===
[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Valley in Western Colorado, a large valley made up of high desert terrain. The city of Grand Junction is located in the heart of the valley]]
The Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.

From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger|pid=5689|name=Pikes Peak, Colorado|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado. Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].

The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.

[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction. The monument is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.]]
[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]], with [[Ute Mountain]] in the distance]]
[[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.

The Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].

Higher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.

The [[Four Corners Monument]] in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]]; the only such place in the United States.

==Climate==
[[File:Colorado Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Colorado]]
The [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.

As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

===Eastern Plains===
The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsFRUC1978&quot;&gt;{{cite report |last=Hansen |first=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer, this area can have many days above 95&amp;nbsp;°F (35&amp;nbsp;°C) and often 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate of Colorado&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to −10&amp;nbsp;°F (−4 to −23&amp;nbsp;°C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&amp;refer=&amp;cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21&amp;nbsp;°C) or higher in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America&quot; /&gt; The average July temperature is 55&amp;nbsp;°F (13&amp;nbsp;°C) in the morning and 90&amp;nbsp;°F (32&amp;nbsp;°C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&amp;nbsp;°F (−8&amp;nbsp;°C) in the morning and 48&amp;nbsp;°F (9&amp;nbsp;°C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&amp;nbsp;°F (20&amp;nbsp;°C).

===Front range foothills===
Just west of the plains and into the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090433/http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme weather===
[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]

Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern Plains, especially the northeast part of the state. Hail is the most commonly reported warm season severe weather hazard, and occasionally causes human injuries, as well as significant property damage, and crop and livestock injury when hailstorms happen to traverse over such areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Childs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |last = Childs  |first = Samuel J.  |author2 = R. S. Schumacher  |title = An Updated Severe Hail and Tornado Climatology for Eastern Colorado  |journal = J. Appl. Meteorol. Climatol.  |volume = 58  |issue = 10  |pages = 2273–2293  |date = 2019  |doi = 10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0098.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern Plains are subject to some of the biggest hail storms in North America.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; Notable examples are the severe hailstorms that hit Denver on July 11, 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/07/11/historic-denver-hailstorm-was-called-worst-in-american-history/|title=Historic Denver Hailstorm Was Called Worst in American History|date=July 11, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and May 8, 2017, the latter being the costliest ever in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/23/hailstorm-costliest-ever-metro-denver/|title=Hailstorm that hammered west metro Denver May 8 is costliest ever for Colorado|date=May 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [[Tornado Alley]]; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the small town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Slater  |first =Jane  |title =Thursday's Tornado State's 4th Costliest Disaster  |publisher =[[KMGH]]  |date =May 28, 2008  |url =http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16408116/detail.html  |access-date =January 25, 2009  |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080604044140/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16408116/detail.html  |archive-date =June 4, 2008  |url-status =dead  |df =mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the eastern Plains see especially frequent tornadoes, both those spawned from [[mesocyclone]]s in [[supercell]] thunderstorms and from less intense [[landspout]]s, such as within the [[Denver convergence vorticity zone]] (DCVZ).&lt;ref name=&quot;Childs&quot;/&gt;

The Plains are also susceptible to occasional floods and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Notable examples include the [[1965 Denver Flood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/news/the-1965-flood-how-denvers-greatest-disaster-changed-the-city-6668119|title=The 1965 Flood: How Denver's Greatest Disaster Changed the City|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 29, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Big Thompson River]] flooding of 1976 and the [[2013 Colorado floods]]. Hot weather is common during summers in Denver. The city's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90&amp;nbsp;°F (32&amp;nbsp;°C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =Denver's Consecutive 90 Degree Streaks  | publisher =[[National Weather Service]]  | accessdate =October 10, 2009  | url =http://www.crh.noaa.gov/bou/?n=consec90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Colorado is very dry, with the state averaging only {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year statewide. The state rarely experiences a time when some portion is not in some degree of drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf|title=A History of Drought|format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the [[Hayman Fire]] of 2002, one of the largest wildfires in American history, and the [[Fourmile Canyon#Fourmile Canyon Fire|Fourmile Canyon Fire]] of 2010, which until the [[Waldo Canyon Fire]] and [[High Park Fire]] of June 2012, and the [[Black Forest Fire]] of June 2013, was the most destructive wildfire in Colorado's recorded history.

[[File:Overlook of Yampa River.jpg|thumb|The Yampa River, from a high overlook]]

However, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River]], the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.

Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

===Earthquakes===
Despite its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively quiet seismically. The U.S. [[National Earthquake Information Center]] is located in [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]].

On August 22, 2011, a [[2011 Colorado earthquake|5.3 magnitude earthquake]] occurred {{convert|9|mi|km}} west-southwest of the city of [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US2/36.38.-106.-104.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117052953/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US2/36.38.-106.-104.php|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no casualties and only a small amount of damage was reported. It was the second-largest earthquake in Colorado's history. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake was recorded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-08-23/Largest-Colorado-quake-since-1973-shakes-homes/50102314/1 |title=Largest Colorado quake since 1973 shakes homes |accessdate=August 23, 2011 | work=USA Today |date=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early morning hours of August 24, 2018, four minor earthquakes rattled the state of Colorado ranging from magnitude 2.9 to 4.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outtherecolorado.com/four-earthquakes-rumble-in-colorado/|title=Four earthquakes rumble Colorado overnight {{!}} OutThere Colorado|date=August 24, 2018|work=OutThere Colorado|access-date=September 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Colorado|Timeline of Colorado history}}
The region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13,000 years. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the valleys and mesas of the [[Colorado Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]&quot;, Discovery News, September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].

[[File:La conquista del Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] discovering Colorado in 1540, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]. [[García López de Cárdenas]] can be seen overlooking the [[Grand Canyon]]]]

The Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to U.S. involvement in the region. The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa Fé de Nuevo México]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.

The U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835–36 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.

[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Mexican Cession]], with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [[Republic of Texas]]) after the [[Mexican–American War]]. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]

Most American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].
[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

===Territory act===
{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Colorado Territory}}
[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]
Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/&gt; The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.&lt;ref name=Colorado_River&gt;Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=Macomb&gt;Report of the exploring expedition from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt. J. N. Macomb, Corps of topographical engineers, Volume 1 [https://archive.org/stream/reportofexplorin00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up @ archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River.

On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.

In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Blood &amp; treasure : Confederate Empire in the Southwest|last=Frazier |first=Donald Shaw |date=1995|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|isbn=0585303304|edition=1st|location=College Station|oclc=45732362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].

In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.

The discovery of a major silver lode near [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]] in 1878 triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum|popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered. Between the 1880s and 1930s, Denver's floriculture industry developed into a major industry in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Shu Liu and Linda M.

Poor labor conditions and discontent among miners resulted in several major clashes between strikers and the [[Colorado Army National Guard|Colorado National Guard]], including the [[Colorado Labor Wars|1903-1904 Western Federation of Miners Strike]] and [[Colorado Coalfield War]], the latter of which included the [[Ludlow massacre]] that killed a dozen women and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Ross 1969&quot;&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, &quot;American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome,&quot; The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

Three warships of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River. The later two ships were named in honor of the state, including the battleship USS ''[[USS Colorado (BB-45)|Colorado]]'' which served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941. At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], this USS ''Colorado'' was located at the naval base in San Diego, Calif. and hence went unscathed.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [[income tax]], regardless of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal ''adjusted gross income'', Colorado taxes are based on ''taxable income''—income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado individual income tax return (2005) [http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf Revenue.state.co.us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217015546/http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }}.

Retrieved September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado's state [[sales tax]] is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, according to Colorado's [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]] legislation, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates, in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

Real estate and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break was scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

{{as of|2018|December|}}, the state's unemployment rate was 4.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/ |title=Local Area Unemployment Statistics Home Page |website=Bls.gov |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
[[File:Grand Junction Trip 92007 131.JPG|thumb|An [[oil well]] in western Colorado]]
Colorado has significant [[hydrocarbon]] resources. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Colorado hosts seven of the Nation's 100 largest natural gas fields, and two of its 100 largest [[oil field]]s. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically account for more than 5 percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado's [[oil shale]] deposits hold an estimated {{convert|1|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil—nearly as much oil as the entire world's proven oil reserves; the economic viability of the oil shale, however, has not been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial deposits of [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], [[sub-bituminous coal|subbituminous]], and [[lignite]] coal are found in the state.

[[Uranium mining in Colorado]] goes back to 1872, when pitchblende ore was taken from gold mines near Central City, Colorado. The Colorado uranium industry has seen booms and busts, but continues to this day. Not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate, Colorado is considered to have the third-largest uranium reserves of any U.S. state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico.

Uranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted a number of companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. Price drops and financing problems in late 2008 forced these companies to cancel or scale back uranium-mining project. Currently, there are no uranium producing mines in Colorado.

Colorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal electricity|geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny, and could produce [[solar power in Colorado|solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for [[ethanol]] production.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Colorado}}
[[File:Colorado.JPG|thumb|left|A Colorado state welcome sign]]

Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&amp;nbsp;25]] (I-25) is the primary north–south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|I-70]] is the primary east–west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver, and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Many smaller communities are only connected to this network via county roads.

[[File:DIA.jpg|thumb|right|The main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the [[Front Range]].]]

[[Denver International Airport]] (DIA) is the fifth-busiest domestic U.S. airport and [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|twentieth busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn%3Daci%26cp%3D1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219174500/http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado, and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States.

Extensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services. The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus &amp; Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]]. {{as of|2013|January|}} the RTD rail system had 170 light-rail vehicles, serving {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track.

[[File:California Zephyr--Eastbound meets Westbound in Glenwood Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The westbound and eastbound ''[[California Zephyr]]s'' meet in the [[Glenwood Canyon]].]] 
[[Amtrak]] operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the [[California Zephyr]] and [[Southwest Chief]]. Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the &quot;Rio Grande&quot; acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.

Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606044205/https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |archivedate=June 6, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State government===

Like the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado's [[Constitution of the State of Colorado|state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.

The [[Governor of Colorado]] heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is [[Jared Polis]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Colorado]] (elected on a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with the Governor), [[Secretary of State of Colorado]], [[Colorado State Treasurer]], and [[Attorney General of Colorado]], all of whom serve four-year terms.

The seven-member [[Colorado Supreme Court]] is the highest judicial court in the state.
The state legislative body is the [[Colorado General Assembly]], which is made up of two houses, the [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Colorado Senate|Senate]]. The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. {{as of|2018}}, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] holds a 19 to 16 majority in the Senate and a 41 to 24 majority in the House.

Most Coloradans are native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title =State of Residence in 2000 by State of Birth
 | publisher =[[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]]
 | accessdate =October 10, 2009
 | url =https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t38/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is illustrated by the fact that the state did not have a native-born governor from 1975 (when [[John David Vanderhoof]] left office) until 2007, when [[Bill Ritter]] took office; [[2006 Colorado gubernatorial election|his election]] the previous year marked the first electoral victory for a native-born Coloradan in a gubernatorial race since 1958 (Vanderhoof had ascended from the Lieutenant Governorship when [[John Arthur Love]] was given a position in [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in 1973). In the 2016 election, the Democratic party won the Colorado electoral college votes.

Tax is collected by the [[Colorado Department of Revenue]].

===Counties===
{{Main|List of counties in Colorado}}
[[File:Map of Colorado counties, labelled.svg|thumb|An enlargeable map of the [[List of counties in Colorado|64 counties]] of the State of Colorado]]
The State of Colorado is divided into 64 [[County (United States)|counties]].&lt;ref name=CountiesCO&gt;{{cite web|date=January 8, 2007 |url=http://www.dola.state.co.us/dlg/local_governments/counties.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202163455/http://www.dola.state.co.us/dlg/local_governments/counties.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 2, 2007 |title=Colorado Counties |publisher=State of Colorado, Department of Local Affairs |accessdate=January 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counties are important units of government in Colorado since the state has no secondary civil subdivisions such as [[Township (United States)|townships]]. Two of these counties, the [[Denver|City and County of Denver]] and the [[Broomfield, Colorado|City and County of Broomfield]], have [[consolidated city-county|consolidated city and county governments]].

Nine Colorado counties have a population in excess of 250,000 each, while eight Colorado counties have a population of less than 2,500 each. The ten most populous Colorado counties are all located in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]].

===Special districts===
The state of Colorado has more than 3,000 [[Special district (United States)|districts with taxing authority]]. These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.

Some of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three &quot;tiers&quot; among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties
* The Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District, approved by voters to pay for and help build the [[Colorado Rockies]]' stadium [[Coors Field]]
* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County

Colorado is considered a [[swing state]] in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Colorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

The state of Colorado is represented by its two [[United States Senate|United States Senators]]:
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]] – [[Cory Gardner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015–
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]] – [[Michael Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009–
Colorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:
* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]] – [[Diana DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997–
* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]] – [[Joe Neguse]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019-
* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district]] – [[Scott Tipton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011–
* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]] – [[Ken Buck]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015–
* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district]] – [[Doug Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2007–
* [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]] – [[Jason Crow]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019–
* [[Colorado's 7th congressional district]] – [[Ed Perlmutter]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2007–

===Significant bills passed in Colorado===
On the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified.

In 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting [[Colorado Amendment 64|&quot;personal use&quot; of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=Healy/&gt;

On May 29, 2019, Governor [[Jared Polis]] signed House Bill 1124 immediately prohibiting law enforcement officials in Colorado from holding [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]] solely on the basis of a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1124|title=Protect Colorado Residents From Federal Government Overreach {{!}} Colorado General Assembly|website=leg.colorado.gov|access-date=May 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
