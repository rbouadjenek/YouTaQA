'''Aaliyah Dana Haughton''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑ:|ˈ|l|iː|ə}}; January 16, 1979&amp;nbsp;– August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. Born in [[Brooklyn]] and raised in [[Detroit]], she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and performed in concert alongside [[Gladys Knight]]. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold 3 million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].

Aaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'', which sold 3 million copies in the United States and more than 8 million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single &quot;[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]&quot;. The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this goal. &quot;Try Again&quot; also earned Aaliyah a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocalist. After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her role in ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'', and released her [[Aaliyah (album)|self-titled third and final studio album]] in 2001.

On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were [[Death of Aaliyah|killed in a plane crash]] in [[the Bahamas]] after filming the music video for the single &quot;[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]&quot;. The pilot, Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and [[toxicology]] tests revealed that he had traces of [[cocaine]] and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. Aaliyah's music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. She has been credited for helping to redefine [[contemporary R&amp;B]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/10-craziest-things-we-learned-from-the-aaliyah-lifetime-movie-20141117|title=10 Craziest Things We Learned From the Aaliyah Lifetime Movie|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=December 14, 2015|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nicknames]] the &quot;Princess of R&amp;B&quot; and &quot;Queen of Urban Pop&quot;. ''Billboard'' lists her as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history.

Throughout Aaliyah's life, she had a good relationship with Rashad, who recalled Aaliyah having a beautiful voice as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farley22-23&quot;&gt;Farley 2002, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when they moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt;

Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, [[Barry Hankerson]], was an [[entertainment law]]yer who had been married to [[Gladys Knight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG rock&quot; /&gt; As a child, Aaliyah traveled with Knight and worked with an agent in New York to audition for commercials and television programs, including ''[[Family Matters]]''; she went on to appear on ''[[Star Search]]'' at the age of ten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot; /&gt; Aaliyah chose to begin auditioning. Her mother made the decision to drop her surname.&lt;ref name=JenniferWarner /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2005|p=15|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; She auditioned for several record labels and at age 11 appeared in concerts alongside Knight.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG rock&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/aaliyah-755377.html|title=Aaliyah – Obituaries, News|last=Perrone|first=Pierre|date=August 27, 2001|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=April 4, 2009|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606064412/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/aaliyah-755377.html|archivedate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had several pet animals during her childhood, including ducks, snakes and iguanas. Her cousin Jomo had a pet alligator, which Aaliyah felt was too much, remarking, &quot;that was something I wasn't going to stroke.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt;

Her grandmother died in 1991. Years after her death, Aaliyah said her grandmother supported everyone in the family and always wanted to hear her sing, as well as admitting that she &quot;spoiled&quot; her and her brother Rashad. She also enjoyed Aaliyah's singing and would have Aaliyah to sing for her. Aaliyah said she thought of her grandmother whenever she fell into depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5NSZQguXKI/UrISESr2cSI/AAAAAAAABdM/yAzUy9B0moU/s1600/tumblr_mxyel4e9l31sck243o4_1280.jpg |title=Photograph of interview|publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah's hands reminded her of her aunt, who died when she was very young and whom Aaliyah remembered as an &quot;amazingly beautiful woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/humor-sweets-delights-article-1.927110|title=HUMOR &amp; SWEETS WERE HER DELIGHTS|first=Lauren|last=Rubin|date=August 28, 2001|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
When she was growing up, Aaliyah attended Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, but she did not stay focused on them. &quot;You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me.&quot; Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had &quot;learned to accept and love&quot; herself and added: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the most important thing is to think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2/&gt;

During her audition for acceptance to the [[Detroit School of Arts|Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts]], Aaliyah sang the song &quot;[[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Ave Maria]]&quot; in its entirety in the [[Italian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage|title=What Lies Beneath?|magazine=[[Vibe Magazine|Vibe]]|page=104|date=August 2001|accessdate=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah, who maintained a perfect 4.0 grade-point average when graduating from high school, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: &quot;I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on.&quot; She did this in her own life, as she planned to &quot;fall back on&quot; another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, &quot;when you pick a career it has to be something you love&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt;

==Career==

===2001: ''Aaliyah''===
After completing ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'', Aaliyah began to work on her second film, ''[[Queen of the Damned]]''. She played the role of an ancient [[vampire]], Queen Akasha, which she described as a &quot;manipulative, crazy, sexual being&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Filming both Romeo Must Die and ''Queen of the Damned'' delayed the release of the album. Aaliyah had not intended for her albums to have such a gap between them. &quot;I wanted to take a break after ''One in a Million'' to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, &quot;Romeo&quot; happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/08/25/aaliyah-final-mtv-interview/|title=Remembering Aaliyah Ten Years Later: The Final MTV Interview|publisher=RAPFIX|date=August 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103000526/http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/08/25/aaliyah-final-mtv-interview/|archivedate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah enjoyed balancing her singing and acting careers. Though she called music a &quot;first&quot; for her, she also had been acting since she was young and had wanted to begin acting &quot;at some point in my career,&quot; but &quot;wanted it to be the right time and the right vehicle&quot; and felt ''Romeo Must Die'' &quot;was it&quot;.&lt;ref name=Billboard2001 /&gt;

Aaliyah was viewed by others as a role model. Emil Wilbekin, described by [[CNN]] as &quot;a friend of Aaliyah's&quot; and follower of her career, explained: &quot;Aaliyah is an excellent role model because she started her career in the public eye at age 15 with a gold album,''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. And then her second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'' went double platinum. She had the leading role in ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'', which was a box office success. She's won numerous awards, several MTV music video awards, and aside from her professional successes, many of her lyrics are very inspirational and uplifting. She also carried herself in a very professional manner. She was well-spoken. She was beautiful, but she didn't use her beauty to sell her music. She used her talent. Many young hip-hop fans greatly admire her.&quot;&lt;ref name=August2001CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/08/27/welbekin.cnna/index.html|title=Vibe Magazine's Emil Wilbekin: Remembering Aaliyah|date=August 27, 2001|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also was seen by others as a [[sex symbol]]. Aaliyah did not have a problem with being considered one. &quot;I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me,&quot; she stated. &quot;It's wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy.

She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she did feel &quot;sexy for sure&quot; and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.&lt;ref name=Vibe2001CoverStory /&gt;

==Personal life==
In her spare time, she was mostly a homebody, which dated back to her younger years, but on occasion went out and played [[laser tag]]. She reasoned this was due to her liking &quot;the simple things in life&quot;.&lt;ref name=Vibe2001CoverStory /&gt; Despite having a prosperous career that allowed her to purchase the vehicle she wanted, Aaliyah revealed during her final interview on August 21, 2001, on ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'' that she had never owned a car because she lived in New York City and could hire a car or driver on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/news/aaliyah-facts-lifetime-movie|title=7 Facts About Aaliyah: Get The Scoop Before You Watch the Lifetime Movie|publisher=[[Biography.com]]|first=Sara|last=Bibel|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Aaliyah's family played a major role in the course of her career.&lt;ref name=Vibe2001CoverStory /&gt; Aaliyah's father Michael Haughton served as her personal manager. Her mother assisted her in her career while brother Rashad Haughton and cousin Jomo Hankerson worked with her consistently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thegrio.com/2011/12/27/drakes-tattoo-to-timbalands-heart-aaliyah-still-idolized-after-all-these-years/|title=Drake's tattoo to Timbaland's heart: Aaliyah still idolized after all these years|date=December 27, 2011|publisher=theGrio|first=Ronda Racha|last=Penrice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's illness ended his co-management of Aaliyah with her mother Diane Haughton. She ran all of her decisions by Rashad.&lt;ref name=Vibe2001CoverStory /&gt;

Aaliyah was known to have usually been accompanied by members of her family and the &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: &quot;It really boggles everyone [that] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad had to take care of my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Farley, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Her friend [[Kidada Jones]] said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. &quot;She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies.&quot;&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aaliyah-1979-2001-20011011?page=2|title=Aaliyah Obituary: Remembering the R&amp;B Star|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 11, 2001|access-date=August 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831083604/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aaliyah-1979-2001-20011011?page=2|archive-date=August 31, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gladys Knight]], who had been married to Aaliyah's uncle [[Barry Hankerson]], was essential to the start of Aaliyah's career as she gave her many of her earlier performances. One of their last conversations concerned Aaliyah having difficulty with &quot;another young artist&quot; that she was trying to work with. Knight felt the argument was &quot;petty&quot; and insisted that she remain being who she was in spite of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623395,00.html|title=Aunt Gladys Knight Remembers Aaliyah|date=January 16, 2002|magazine=[[People.com]]|first=Stephen M.|last=Silverman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal marriage===
With the release of ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number'', rumors circulated of a relationship between Aaliyah and R.

Aaliyah reportedly developed a friendship with Kelly during the recording of her debut album. As she recalled to ''Vibe'' magazine in 1994, she and Kelly would &quot;go watch a movie&quot; and &quot;go eat&quot; when she got tired and would then &quot;come back and work&quot;. She described the relationship between her and Kelly as being &quot;rather close.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://b96.cbslocal.com/2011/08/31/r-kelly-and-aaliyah-secretly-married-on-this-day-in-1994/|title=R.

In December 1994, Aaliyah told the ''Sun-Times'' that whenever she was asked about being married to Kelly, she urged them not to believe &quot;all that mess&quot; and that she and Kelly were &quot;close&quot; and &quot;people took it the wrong way.&quot;&lt;ref name=WBEZ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-07/timeline-life-and-career-r-kelly-107973|title=Timeline: The life and career of R. Kelly|publisher=[[WBEZ 91.5 Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 2011 book ''The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out'', Demetrius Smith Sr., a former member of Kelly's entourage, wrote that Kelly told him &quot;in a voice that sounded as if he wanted to burst into tears&quot; that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://s2smagazine.com/2011/05/25/did-rkelly-impregnate-aaliyah/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084043/http://s2smagazine.com/2011/05/25/did-rkelly-impregnate-aaliyah/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 19, 2014|title=Did R.

[[Jamie Foster Brown]] in the 1994 issue of ''[[Sister 2 Sister]]'' wrote that &quot;R. Kelly told me that he and Aaliyah got together and it was just magic.&quot; Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. &quot;I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and going in and out of his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men.&quot; Brown later added &quot;at 15, you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dywEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=aaliyah#v=onepage&amp;q=aaliyah|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=December 1994|title=R. Kelly marriage to Aaliyah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]'' revealed new details about their relationship and marriage. Jovante Cunningham, a former backup dancer, claimed to have witnessed Kelly having sex with Aaliyah on his tour bus&lt;ref name=&quot;Surviving&quot;&gt;[https://www.essence.com/entertainment/r-kelly-aaliyah-marriage-new-details/ ‘Surviving R.

Aaliyah admitted in court documents that she had lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/kelly/939951,kellya.article |title=Kelly accused of sex with teenage girls |date=December 21, 2000 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516005806/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/kelly/939951%2Ckellya.article |archivedate=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah &quot;got villainized&quot; over her relationship with Kelly and the scandal over the marriage made it difficult to find producers for her second album. &quot;We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was hard for us to get producers on the album.&quot; Hankerson also expressed confusion over why &quot;they were upset&quot; with Aaliyah given her age at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://madamenoire.com/441983/aaliyahs-cousin-says-villainized-r-kelly-marriage-scandal-dont-understand-upset-baby-girl/|title=Aaliyah's Cousin Says She Was 'Villainized' Over R.

Aaliyah was known to avoid answering questions regarding Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if she was still in contact with him and if she would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a &quot;firm, frosty 'no'&quot; to both of the questions.&lt;ref&gt;Farley 2002, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vibe'' magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime &quot;you bring up the marriage with her&quot;.&lt;ref name=VibeAugust2001 /&gt; A spokeswoman for Aaliyah said in 2000 that when &quot;R.

R. Kelly would have other allegations made about him regarding underage girls in the years following her death and his marriage to Aaliyah was used to evidence his involvement with them. He has refused to discuss his relationship with her, citing her death. &quot;Out of respect for her, and her mom and her dad, I will not discuss Aaliyah.

===Engagement===
Aaliyah was dating co-founder of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] [[Damon Dash]] at the time of her death and, though they were not formally engaged, in interviews given after Aaliyah's death, Dash claimed the couple had planned to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calloway|first=Sway|title=Damon Dash Says Every Day with Aaliyah Was Special|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448466/boyfriend-damon-dash-recalls-aaliyah.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=August 5, 2014|author2=Hiatt, Brian |author3=Kroft, Ryan|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah and Dash met in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aaliyah: A Biography|last=Warner|first=Jennifer|publisher=BookCaps Study Guides|year=2014|isbn=978-1-5006-2821-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his accountant and formed a friendship.&lt;ref name=Billboard2011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/467784/damon-dash-talks-losing-aaliyah-nothing-prepares-you-for-that|title=Damon Dash Talks Losing Aaliyah: 'Nothing Prepares You for That'|date=August 24, 2011|work=Billboard|first=Erika|last=Ramirez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dash has said he is unsure of how he and Aaliyah started dating and that the two just understood each other. &quot;I don't know [how we got involved], just spending time, you know, we just saw things the same and it was new, you know what I mean?

Dash expressed his belief that Aaliyah was the &quot;one&quot; and claimed the pair were not officially engaged, but had spoken about getting married prior to her death.&lt;ref&gt;Farley 2002, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aaliyah publicly never addressed the relationship between her and Dash as being anything but platonic. In May 2001, she hosted a party for Dash's 30th birthday at a New York City club, where they were spotted together and Dash was seen escorting her to a bathroom. Addressing this, Aaliyah stated that she and Dash were just &quot;very good friends&quot; and chose to &quot;keep it at that&quot; for the time being.&lt;ref name=VibeAugust2001&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|title=Vibe interview in August 2001|work=Vibe|date=August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two weeks before her death, Aaliyah traveled from New Jersey to East Hampton, New York to visit Dash at the summer house he shared with [[Jay Z]].&lt;ref name=RollingStone /&gt;

The couple were separated for long periods at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to &quot;his own thing&quot;, which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that the time they had together was special. Dash remembered they would &quot;be in a room full of people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room&quot;. Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement.&lt;ref name=Billboard2011 /&gt; The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song &quot;[[Miss You (Aaliyah song)|Miss You]]&quot;, released after her death.

In response to the criticism, T-Pain questioned if Aaliyah's legacy was driven by her death and claimed that were she still alive, she would be seen as trying to emulate [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allhiphop.com/2015/03/30/t-pain-aaliyah-when-someone-dies-people-act-they-were-the-greatest-the-iron-way-girlfriend/ |title=T-Pain On Criticism For Using Aaliyah's Vocals: When Someone Dies People Act Like They Were The Greatest (VIDEO) |date=March 30, 2015 |publisher=AllHipHop |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331003548/http://allhiphop.com/2015/03/30/t-pain-aaliyah-when-someone-dies-people-act-they-were-the-greatest-the-iron-way-girlfriend/ |archivedate=March 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to T-Pain, he was given her vocals from a session she had done prior to her death after being approached to work on a track for a posthumous Aaliyah album and completing the song, calling the exchange &quot;just like a swap.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2015/03/t-pain-says-aaliyah-overhyped-because-death/|title=T-Pain Speaks On Aaliyah's Overly Exclusive Legacy|publisher=Vibe|first=Stacy-Ann|last=Ellis|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
