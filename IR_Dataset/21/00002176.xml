'''Ahmad Shah Massoud''' ([[Dari language|Dari Persian]]/[[Pashto]]: {{lang|fa|احمد شاه مسعود}};&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-fa|ʔæhmæd ʃɒːh mæsʔuːd}}&lt;/ref&gt; September 2, 1953{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 2001) was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] politician and military commander. He was a powerful [[guerilla]] commander during the resistance against the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation]] between 1979 and 1989. In the 1990s he led the government's military wing against rival militias and, after the [[Taliban]] takeover, was the leading opposition commander against their regime,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/09/world/afghan-lion-fights-taliban-with-rifle-and-fax-machine.html|title=Afghan 'Lion' Fights Taliban With Rifle and Fax Machine|first=Barry|last=Bearak|date=November 9, 1999|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who he fought against until his assassination in 2001.

Massoud came from an ethnic [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] background in the [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]] valley of northern Afghanistan. He began studying engineering at [[Polytechnical University of Kabul]] in the 1970s, where he became involved with religious anti-[[communist]] movements around [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], a leading [[Islamist]]. He was part of a failed uprising against [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]'s government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyinanhour.com/2012/07/18/mohammed-daoud-khan-summary/|title=Mohammed Daoud Khan|date=July 18, 2012|work=History in an Hour|access-date=December 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929064911/http://www.historyinanhour.com/2012/07/18/mohammed-daoud-khan-summary/|archive-date=September 29, 2018|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined Rabbani's [[Jamiat-e Islami]] party. During the Soviet–Afghan War, his role as a powerful [[mujahideen]] insurgent leader earned him the nickname of &quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot; ({{lang|fa|شیر پنجشیر}}) among his followers as he successfully resisted the Soviets from taking Panjshir Valley. In 1992 he signed the [[Peshawar Accord]], a peace and power-sharing agreement, in the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Clements |first=Frank |title=Civil War |encyclopedia=Conflict in Afghanistan: A Historical Encyclopedia Roots of Modern Conflict |date=2003 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=bv4hzxpo424C}} |accessdate=March 12, 2015 |pages=49 |isbn=9781851094028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was so appointed as the Minister of Defense as well as the government's main military commander.

Following the rise of the Taliban in 1996, Massoud, who rejected the Taliban's fundamentalist interpretation of Islam,&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad_310&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcela Grad |title=Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310 |publisher=Webster University Press|isbn=}}{{pb}}Also [[Peter Bergen]] (2011), {{Google books |title=The Longest War: The Enduring Conflict Between America and Al-Qaeda |id=kYdLqOUj8lUC |page=8 }}. &quot;Mahmoud [...] espoused a more moderate form of Islamism and an orientation to the West.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; returned to armed opposition until he eventually fled to [[Kulob]], [[Tajikistan]], strategically destroying the [[Salang Tunnel]] on his way north. He became the military and political leader of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan]] or Northern Alliance, which by 2000 controlled only between 5 and 10 percent of the country. In 2001 he visited Europe and in high-level meetings with the [[European Parliament]] urged leaders to pressure [[Pakistan]] on its support for the Taliban. He also asked for humanitarian aid to help the people's gruesome conditions under the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1340726/Ahmad-Shah-Massoud.html|title=Ahmad Shah Massoud|date=September 16, 2001|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud was assassinated at the instigation of [[al-Qaeda]] and Taliban in a [[suicide bombing]] on September 9, 2001.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Two days later the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States occurred, which led to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] [[US invasion of Afghanistan|invading]] Afghanistan, allying with Massoud's forces. His forces eventually won the two-month long war in December 2001, removing the Taliban from power.

Massoud was posthumously named &quot;National Hero&quot; by the order of President [[Hamid Karzai]] after the Taliban were ousted from power. The date of Massoud's death, September 9, is observed as a national holiday known as &quot;Massoud Day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/afghanistan/events|title=Afghanistan Events|date=September 15, 2014|work=Lonely Planet|accessdate=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907051320/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/afghanistan/events|archive-date=September 7, 2008|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; His followers call him ''Amer Sāhib-e Shahīd'' ({{lang|fa|آمر صاحب شهید}}), which translates to &quot;(our) martyred commander.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/afghanistan/story/2004/09/040909_v-afghanmasoud.shtml|title=پنجشير: سه سال پس از مسعود|last=قاريزاده|first=داود|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefactmagazine.com/2016/03/20/the-forgotten-hero-of-afghanistan-the-lion-of-panjshir/ The forgotten hero of Afghanistan] ''Artefact Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud has been described as one of the greatest guerilla leaders of the 20th century and has been compared to [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref&gt;''Soldiers of God'' by Robert D. Kaplan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons for this was because he successfully managed to repeatedly defend his local [[Panjshir Valley]] from being taken by the Soviets and thereafter by the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/138748304|title=MASSOUD told by Reza and Olivier Weber|first=Julie|last=Faucher|date=September 9, 2015|publisher=|via=[[Vimeo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Ahmad Shah Massoud was born in 1953&lt;ref&gt;According to his biographer Michael Barry, his exact date of birth was not recorded (M. Barry, ''Massoud: de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p.56).&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]], [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], to a well-to-do family native to the Panjshir valley. His name at birth was &quot;Ahmed Shah&quot;; he took the name &quot;Massoud&quot; as a ''[[nom de guerre]]'' when he went into the resistance movement in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Michael, ''Massoud: de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Dost Mohammad Khan, was a colonel in the [[Afghan National Army#History|Royal Afghan Army]]. From his native Panjshir, his family moved briefly to [[Herat]] and then to [[Kabul]], where Massoud spent most of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;M. Barry, ''Massoud'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massoud attended the renowned Franco-Afghan [[Lycée Esteqlal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcela Grad |title=Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310 |publisher=Webster University Press|isbn=}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as a gifted student, he studied engineering at [[Kabul University]] after his graduation from the Lycée.&lt;ref name=Vollmer&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vollmer|first=Susan|title=Legends, Leaders, Legacies|year=2007|publisher=Bootheel Publishing|isbn=978-0979523311|page=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2012}} Massoud's native tongue was [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari (Afghan Farsi)]] but could also speak [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]] ([[Lashkari language|Lashkari]]) and [[French language|French]] and had good English reading skills.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcela Grad |title=Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310 |publisher=Webster University Press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his youth, Massoud read the works of Chinese revolutionary [[Mao Zedong]] and Argentine [[Che Guevara]]. He said he learned from Mao, but found Guevara's thinking to be too simple.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

In 1973, former Prime Minister [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] was brought to power in a [[1973 Afghan coup|coup d'état]] backed by the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]], and the [[Republic of Afghanistan]] was established. These developments gave rise to an [[Islamist]] movement opposed to the increasing [[communist]] and Soviet influence over Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During that time, while studying at Kabul University, Massoud became involved with the [[Muslim Youth]] (Sazman-i Jawanan-i Musulman), the student branch of the [[Jamiat-e Islami]] (Islamic Society), whose chairman then was the professor [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. Kabul University was a centre for political debate and activism during that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akbarzadeh &amp; Yasmeen&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Shahram Akbarzadeh |author2=Samina Yasmeen |title=Islam And the West: Reflections from Australia|edition=2005 |pages=81–82 |publisher=University of New South Wales Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1975, the Muslim Youth, with help from the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani intelligence]], staged an uprising against the government in Massoud's Panjshir Valley. The group, which included Massoud, hoped to gain civilian support, but the plan backfired when the locals instead chased them to the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/current.bak/issue/is1.html&lt;/ref&gt; After this failure, a &quot;profound and long-lasting schism&quot; within the Islamist movement began to emerge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} The Islamic Society split between supporters of the more moderate forces around Massoud and Rabbani, who led the Jamiat-i Islami, and more radical Islamist elements surrounding [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], who founded the [[Hezb-i Islami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Akbarzadeh &amp; Yasmeen&quot; /&gt; The conflict reached such a point that Hekmatyar reportedly tried to kill Massoud, then 22 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

==The Soviet invasion and PDPA communism==

===Communist revolution in Afghanistan (1978)===
{{Main|Saur Revolution}}
The government of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] tried to scale back the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]]'s influence, dismissing PDPA members from their government posts, appointing conservatives to replace them, and finally announcing the dissolution of the PDPA, with the arrests of senior party members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi (2)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Neamatollah Nojumi |title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |page=39|publisher=Palgrave, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 1978, the PDPA and military units loyal to it killed Daoud Khan, his immediate family, and bodyguards in a violent coup, and seized control of the capital Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi (3)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Neamatollah Nojumi |title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |page=41|publisher=Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new PDPA government, led by a revolutionary council, did not enjoy the support of the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi (4)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Neamatollah Nojumi |title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |page=42 |publisher=Palgrave, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It announced and implemented a doctrine hostile to political dissent, whether inside or outside the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi (4)&quot;/&gt;

The PDPA started reforms along [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and Soviet lines. The reforms and the PDPA's affinity to the Soviet Union were met with strong resistance by the population, especially as the government attempted to enforce its Marxist policies by arresting or executing those who resisted. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people were estimated to have been arrested and killed by communist troops in the countryside alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver Roy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oliver Roy |title=Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan|edition=1990 |page=95|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the repression, large parts of the country, especially the rural areas, organized into open revolt against the PDPA government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver Roy (2)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oliver Roy |title=Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan|edition=1990 |page=|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} By spring 1979 unrest had reached 24 out of 28 Afghan provinces, including major urban areas. Over half of the Afghan army either deserted or joined the insurrection.

Believing that an uprising against the Soviet-backed communists would be supported by the people, Massoud, on July 6, 1979, started an insurrection in the Panjshir, which initially failed. Massoud decided to avoid conventional confrontation with the larger government forces and to wage a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Isby |title=War in a distant country, Afghanistan: invasion and resistance |year=1989 |publisher=Arms and Armour Press |isbn=0 85368 769 2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/warindistantcoun0000isby/page/107 107] |url=https://archive.org/details/warindistantcoun0000isby/page/107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently took full control of Panjshir, pushing out Afghan communist troops. Oliver Roy writes that in the following period, Massoud's &quot;personal prestige and the efficiency of his military organisation persuaded many local commanders to come and learn from him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver Roy (3)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oliver Roy |title=Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan|edition=1990 |page=132|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance against the Soviet Union (1979–1989)===
{{Main|Soviet–Afghan War}}
[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|Major resistance forces against the Soviets 1985; Army-green depicts locations of [[Jamiat-i Islami]]. [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Massoud's alliance) comprised many Jamiat positions but also those of other groups.]]

Following the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|1979 Soviet invasion]] and occupation of Afghanistan, Massoud devised a strategic plan for expelling the invaders and overthrowing the communist regime. The first task was to establish a popularly based resistance force that had the loyalty of the people. The second phase was &quot;active defense&quot; of the Panjshir stronghold, while carrying out [[asymmetric warfare]]. In the third phase, the &quot;strategic offensive&quot;, Massoud's forces would gain control of large parts of Northern Afghanistan. The fourth phase was the &quot;general application&quot; of Massoud's principles to the whole country, and the defeat of the Afghan communist government.

From the start of the war, Massoud's [[mujahideen]] attacked the occupying Soviet forces, ambushing Soviet and Afghan communist convoys travelling through the [[Salang Pass]], and causing fuel shortages in Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iyer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first2=Pico |last2=Iyer |last1=van Voorst |first1=Bruce |last3=Aftab |first3=Mohammad

Between 1980 and 1985, these offensives were conducted twice a year. Despite engaging more men and hardware on each occasion, the Soviets were unable to defeat Massoud's forces. In 1982, the Soviets began deploying major combat units in the Panjshir, numbering up to 30,000 men. Massoud pulled his troops back into subsidiary valleys, where they occupied fortified positions. When the Soviet columns advanced onto these positions, they fell into ambushes. When the Soviets withdrew, Afghan army garrisons took over their positions. Massoud and his mujahideen forces attacked and recaptured them one by one.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Soviets offered Massoud a temporary truce, which he accepted in order to rebuild his own forces and give the civilian population a break from Soviet attacks. He put the respite to good use. In this time he created the [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Supervisory Council), which subsequently united 130 commanders from 12 Afghan provinces in their fight against the Soviet army. This council existed outside the Peshawar parties, which were prone to internecine rivalry and bickering, and served to smooth out differences between resistance groups, due to political and ethnic divisions. It was the predecessor of what could have become a unified Islamic Afghan army.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Michael (2002). ''Massoud, de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p. 216. Paris: Audibert. {{in lang|fr}} {{ISBN|2-84749-002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations with the party headquarters in [[Peshawar]] were often strained, as Rabbani insisted on giving Massoud no more weapons and supplies than to other Jamiat commanders, even those who did little fighting. To compensate for this deficiency, Massoud relied on revenues drawn from exports of [[emerald]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bowersox, Gary |author2=Snee, Lawrence |author3=Foord, Eugene |author4=Seal, Robert |url=http://www.gems-afghan.com/articles/page26a.jpg|title=''Emeralds of the Panjshir valley, Afghanistan'' |year=1991|publisher= www.gems-afghan.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lapis lazuli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commission-refugies.fr/IMG/pdf/Afghanistan-les_seigneurs_de_guerre.pdf|format=PDF|title=Le pouvoir des seigneurs de guerre et la situation sécuritaire en Afghanistan|language=French|publisher= commission-refugies.fr|accessdate=August 16, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075907/http://www.commission-refugies.fr/IMG/pdf/Afghanistan-les_seigneurs_de_guerre.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2007 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are traditionally exploited in Northern Afghanistan.

To organize support for the mujahideen, Massoud established an administrative system that enforced law and order (''nazm'') in areas under his control. The Panjshir was divided into 22 bases (''qarargah'') governed by a military commander and a civilian administrator, and each had a judge, a prosecutor and a [[public defender]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, L. Will; Shariat, Abdullah (2004). ''Fighting Masoud's War'', Melbourne: Lothian, p. 200. {{ISBN|0-7344-0590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud's policies were implemented by different committees: an economic committee was charged with funding the war effort. The health committee provided health services, assisted by volunteers from foreign [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as [[Aide médicale internationale]]. An education committee was charged with the training of the military and administrative [[En cadre|cadre]]. A culture committee and a judiciary committee were also created.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

This expansion prompted [[Babrak Karmal]] to demand that the Red Army resume their offensives, in order to crush the Panjshir groups. However, Massoud had received warning of the attack through his intelligence agents in the government and he evacuated all 130,000 inhabitants from the valley into the Hindukush mountains, leaving the Soviet bombings to fall on empty ground and the Soviet battalions to face the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the defeat of the Soviet-Afghan attacks, Massoud carried out the next phase of his strategic plan, expanding the resistance movement and liberating the northern provinces of Afghanistan. In August 1986, he captured [[Farkhar District|Farkhar]] in [[Takhar Province]]. In November 1986, his forces overran the headquarters of the government's 20th division at Nahrin in [[Baghlan Province]], scoring an important victory for the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion was also carried out through diplomatic means, as more mujahideen commanders were persuaded to adopt the Panjshir military system.

Despite almost constant attacks by the Red Army and the Afghan army, Massoud increased his military strength. Starting in 1980 with a force of less than 1,000 ill-equipped guerrillas, the Panjshir valley mujahideen grew to a 5,000-strong force by 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iyer&quot; /&gt; After expanding his influence outside the valley, Massoud increased his resistance forces to 13,000 fighters by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Isby, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces were divided into different types of units: the locals (mahalli) were tasked with static defense of villages and fortified positions. The best of the mahalli were formed into units called grup-i zarbati (shock troops), semi-mobile groups that acted as [[Military reserve|reserve]] forces for the defense of several strongholds. A different type of unit was the mobile group (grup-i-mutaharek), a lightly equipped [[commando]]-like formation numbering 33 men, whose mission was to carry out [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] attacks outside the Panjshir, sometimes as far as 100&amp;nbsp;km from their base. These men were professional soldiers, well-paid and trained, and, from 1983 on, they provided an effective strike force against government outposts. Uniquely among the mujahideen, these groups wore uniforms, and their use of the ''[[pakul]]'' made this headwear emblematic of the Afghan resistance.

Massoud's military organization was an effective compromise between the traditional Afghan method of warfare and the modern principles of guerrilla warfare which he had learned from the works of [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Che Guevara]]. His forces were considered the most effective of all the various Afghan resistance movements.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States provided Massoud with comparatively less support than other factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillips&quot; /&gt; Part of the reason was that it permitted its funding and arms distribution to be administered by Pakistan, which favored the rival mujahideen leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In an interview, Massoud said, &quot;We thought the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] knew everything. But they didn't. They supported some bad people [meaning Hekmatyar].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Primary advocates for supporting Massoud were the US [[State Department]]'s [[Edmund McWilliams]] and [[Peter Tomsen]], who were on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Soviet army and the Afghan communist army were mainly defeated by Massoud and his mujahideen in numerous small engagements between 1984 and 1988. In 1989, after describing the Soviet Union's military engagement in Afghanistan &quot;a bleeding wound&quot;, Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began a withdrawal of Soviet troops from the nation. On February 15, 1989, in what was depicted as an improbable victory for the mujahideen, the last Soviet soldier left the nation.

===Fall of the Afghan communist regime (1992)===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)}}

After the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|departure of Soviet troops]] in 1989, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] regime, then headed by [[Mohammad Najibullah]], held its own against the mujahideen. Backed by a massive influx of weapons from the Soviet Union, the Afghan armed forces reached a level of performance they had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. They maintained control over all of Afghanistan's major cities. During the late 1990, helped by Hekmatyar as well as hundreds of Pakistani-trained mujahideen forces, Massoud targeted the [[Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR|Tajik Supreme Soviet]], trying to oust communism from the neighboring Tajikistan to further destabilize the dying Soviet Union, which would also impact the Afghan government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Curtis (British author)|Mark Curtis]], ''Secret Affairs: Britain's Collusion with Radical Islam'', Serpent's Tail (2010), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, as per [[Asad Durrani]], the director-general of the ISI during this period, Massoud's base camp was in [[Garam Chashma]], in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Asad Durrani, ''Pakistan Adrift: Navigating Troubled Waters'', Hurst (2018), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Afghan regime eventually began to crumble. Food and fuel shortages undermined the capacities of the government's army, and a resurgence of factionalism split the regime between [[Khalq]] and [[Parcham]] supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0120)|title=''The Fall of Kabul, April 1992''|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after Najibullah had lost control of the nation, his army commanders and governors arranged to turn over authority to resistance commanders and local warlords throughout the country. Joint councils (''shuras'') were immediately established for local government, in which civil and military officials of the former government were usually included. In many cases, prior arrangements for transferring regional and local authority had been made between foes.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot; /&gt;

Collusions between military leaders quickly brought down the Kabul government. In mid-January 1992, within three weeks of the demise of the Soviet Union, Massoud was aware of conflict within the government's northern command. General [[Abdul Momim]], in charge of the [[Hairatan]] border crossing at the northern end of Kabul's supply highway, and other non-[[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] generals based in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], feared removal by Najibullah and replacement by Pashtun officers. When the generals rebelled, [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], who held [[General Officer|general rank]] as head of the [[Jowzjan]]i militia, also based in Mazar-i-Sharif, took over.

He and Massoud reached a political agreement, together with another major militia leader, Sayyed Mansour, of the [[Ismaili]] community based in Baghlan Province. These northern allies consolidated their position in Mazar-i-Sharif on March 21. Their coalition covered nine provinces in the north and northeast. As turmoil developed within the government in Kabul, no government force stood between the northern allies and the major [[Bagram Air Base|air force base at Bagram]], some seventy kilometers north of Kabul. By mid-April 1992, the Afghan air force command at Bagram had capitulated to Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot; /&gt; On March 18, 1992, Najibullah announced he would resign. On April 17, as his government fell, he tried to escape but was stopped at [[Kabul Airport]] by Dostum's forces. He took refuge at the United Nations mission, where he remained unharmed until 1996, while Massoud controlled the area surrounding the mission.

Senior communist generals and officials of the Najibullah administration acted as a transitional authority to transfer power to Ahmad Shah Massoud's alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0120%29|title=The Fall of Kabul, April 1992|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0121%29|title=The United Nations Plan for Political Accommodation|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kabul interim authority invited Massoud to enter Kabul as the new Head of State, but he held back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roy Gutman|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |page=34|publisher=Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud ordered his forces, positioned to the north of Kabul, not to enter the capital until a political solution was in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman (2)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roy Gutman|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |pages=|publisher=Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} He called on all the senior Afghan party leaders, many then based in exile in [[Peshawar]], to work out a political settlement acceptable to all sides and parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Amin Saikal |authorlink=Amin Saikal|title=Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=214|publisher=I.B.

====Peace and power-sharing agreement (1992)====
With United Nations support, most Afghan political parties decided to appoint a legitimate national government to succeed communist rule, through an elite settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Tomsen 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=The Wars of Afghanistan: Messianic Terrorism, Tribal Conflicts, and the Failures of Great Powers |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=NCoyhgdHHyAC}} |accessdate=January 22, 2014|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586487812}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the external Afghan party leaders were residing in Peshawar, the military situation around Kabul involving the internal commanders was tense. A 1991 UN peace process brought about some negotiations, but the attempted elite settlement did not develop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Tomsen 2&quot;/&gt; In April 1992, resistance leaders in Peshawar tried to negotiate a settlement. Massoud supported the Peshawar process of establishing a broad coalition government inclusive of all resistance parties, but Hekmatyar sought to become the sole ruler of Afghanistan, stating, &quot;In our country coalition government is impossible because, this way or another, it is going to be weak and incapable of stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal (3)&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Amin Saikal|authorlink=Amin Saikal|title=Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st|page=215|publisher=I.B.

Massoud wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All the parties had participated in the war, in jihad in Afghanistan, so they had to have their share in the government, and in the formation of the government. Afghanistan is made up of different nationalities. We were worried about a national conflict between different tribes and different nationalities. In order to give everybody their own rights and also to avoid bloodshed in Kabul, we left the word to the parties so they should decide about the country as a whole. We talked about it for a temporary stage and then after that the ground should be prepared for a general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi (5)&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Neamatollah Nojumi|title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st|page=112|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A recorded radio communication between the two leaders showed the divide as Massoud asked Hekmatyar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kabul regime is ready to surrender, so instead of the fighting we should gather. ... The leaders are meeting in Peshawar. ... The troops should not enter Kabul, they should enter later on as part of the government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hekmatyar's response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will march into Kabul with our naked sword. No one can stop us. ... Why should we meet the leaders?&quot; Massoud answered: &quot;It seems to me that you don't want to join the leaders in Peshawar nor stop your threat, and you are planning to enter Kabul ... in that case I must defend the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcela Grad|title=Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009|publisher=Webster University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point [[Osama bin Laden]], trying to mediate, urged Hekmatyar to &quot;go back with your brothers&quot; and to accept a compromise.

On April 24, 1992, the leaders in Peshawar agreed on and signed the [[Peshawar Accord]], establishing the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] – which was a stillborn 'state' with a paralyzed 'government' right from its inception, until its final succumbing in September 1996.&lt;ref name=photius,peshawar&gt;[https://photius.com/countries/afghanistan/government/afghanistan_government_the_peshawar_accord~72.html 'The Peshawar Accord, April 25, 1992'].

Hekmatyar refused to sign. With the exception of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, all of the other Peshawar resistance parties were unified under this peace and power-sharing accord in April 1992.

====Escalating war over Kabul (1992)====
Although repeatedly offered the position of prime minister, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar refused to recognize the peace and power-sharing agreement. His [[Hezb-e Islami]] militia initiated a massive bombardment campaign against the Islamic State and the capital city Kabul. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from neighboring [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Neamatollah Nojumi|title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st|publisher=Palgrave, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; The Director of the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies at the [[Australian National University]], [[Amin Saikal]], writes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'' that without Pakistan's support, Hekmatyar &quot;would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; Saikal states that Pakistan wanted to install a favorable regime under Hekmatyar in Kabul so that it could use Afghan territory for access to [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;

Hekmatyar's rocket bombardments and the parallel escalation of violent conflict between two militias, Ittihad and Wahdat, which had entered some suburbs of Kabul, led to a breakdown in law and order. Shia [[Iran]] and Sunni Wahabbi [[Saudi Arabia]], as competitors for regional [[hegemony]], encouraged conflict between the Ittihad and Wahdat factions. On the one side was the Shia Hazara [[Hezb-i Wahdat]] of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]] and on the other side, the Sunni Pashtun [[Ittihad-i Islami]] of [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=July 6, 2005|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title=Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Human Rights Watch, Iran was strongly supporting the Hezb-i Wahdat forces, with Iranian intelligence officials providing direct orders, while Saudi Arabia supported Sayyaf and his Ittihad-i Islami faction to maximize Wahhabi influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt; Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos, as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46725c962.pdf|title=Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: 1978–2001|publisher=Afghanistan Justice Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud's Jamiat commanders, the interim government, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) repeatedly tried to negotiate ceasefires, which broke down in only a few days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt; Another militia, the [[Junbish-i Milli]] of former communist general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], was backed by [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; Uzbek president [[Islam Karimov]] was keen to see Dostum controlling as much of Afghanistan as possible, especially in the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; Dostum repeatedly changed allegiances.

The Afghanistan Justice Project (AJP) says, that &quot;while [Hekmatyar's anti-government] Hizb-i Islami is frequently named as foremost among the factions responsible for the deaths and destruction in the bombardment of Kabul, it was not the only perpetrator of these violations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt; According to the AJP, &quot;the scale of the bombardment and kinds of weapons used represented disproportionate use of force&quot; in a capital city with primarily residential areas by all the factions involved—including the government forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt; Crimes were committed by individuals within the different armed factions. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar released 10,000 dangerous criminals from the main prisons into the streets of Kabul to destabilize the city and cut off Kabul from water, food and energy supplies. The Iran-controlled Wahdat of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]], as well as the Ittihad of [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] supported by Saudi Arabia, targeted civilians of the 'opposite side' in systematic atrocities. [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] allowed crimes as a perceived payment for his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1998 |url= https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-01.htm |title= II.

==== Afshar operation (Febr. 1993) ====
&quot;The major criticism of Massoud's human rights record&quot; is the escalation of the [[Afshar Operation|Afshar military operation]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman 2&quot;/&gt; A report by the Afghanistan Justice Project describes Massoud as failing to prevent atrocities carried out by his forces and those of their factional ally, Ittihad-i Islami, against civilians on taking the suburb of Afshar during a [[Afshar operation|military operation]] against an anti-state militia allied to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. They shelled residential areas in the capital city in February 1993. Critics said that Massoud should have foreseen these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt; A meeting convened by Massoud on the next day ordered a halt to killing and looting, but it failed to stop abuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]], in a report based largely on the material collected by the Afghanistan Justice Project, concurs that Massoud's Jamiat forces bear a share of the responsibility for human rights abuses throughout the war, including the indiscriminate targeting of civilians in Afshar, and that Massoud was personally implicated in some of these abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=O9WpdkMh-XkC |page=100 }} |title=Blood-stained Hands: Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of ... |publisher=|date=September 9, 2001 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Gutman]] has argued that the witness reports about Afshar cited in the AJP report implicated only the Ittihad forces, and that these had not been under Massoud's direct command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman 2&quot;&gt;Gutman, Roy (2008): ''How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan,'' Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington D.C., p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Davis, who studied and observed Massoud's forces from 1981 to 2001, reported that during the observed period, there was &quot;no pattern of repeated killings of enemy civilians or military prisoners&quot; by Massoud's forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman 2&quot;/&gt; Edward Girardet, who covered Afghanistan for over three decades, was also in Kabul during the war. He states that while Massoud was able to control most of his commanders well during the anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban resistance, he was not able to control every commander in Kabul. According to this and similar testimonies, this was due to a breakdown of law and order in Kabul and a war on multiple fronts, which they say, Massoud personally had done all in his power to prevent:&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|quote=Massoud was always talking to his people about not behaving badly; he told them that they were accountable to their God. But because of the rocket attacks on the city the number of troops had to be increased, so there were ten or twelve thousand troops from other sources that came in ... He [Massoud] not only did not order any [crimes], but he was deeply distressed by them. I remember once ... Massoud commented that some commanders were behaving badly, and said that he was trying to bring them to justice ...&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;|author=Eng. Mohammad Eshaq|source=in ''Massoud'' (Webster University Press, 2009)}}

==== Further war over Kabul (March–December 1993) ====
In 1993, Massoud created the Cooperative Mohammad Ghazali Culture Foundation (''Bonyad-e Farhangi wa Ta'wani Mohammad-e Ghazali'') to further humanitarian assistance and politically independent Afghan culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt; The Ghazali Foundation provided free medical services during some days of the week to residents of Kabul who were unable to pay for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt; The Ghazali Foundation's department for distribution of auxiliary goods was the first partner of the Red Cross. The Ghazali Foundation's department of family consultation was a free advisory board, which was accessible seven days a week for the indigent. Although Massoud was responsible for the financing of the foundation, he did not interfere with its cultural work. A council led the foundation and a jury, consisting of impartial university lecturers, decided on the works of artists. The Ghazali foundation enabled Afghan artists to exhibit their works at different places in Kabul, and numerous artists and authors were honoured for their works; some of them neither proponents of Massoud nor the Islamic State government.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In March 1993, Massoud resigned his government position in exchange for peace, as requested by Hekmatyar, who considered him as a personal rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal (3)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0126%29|title=The Islamabad and Jalalabad Accords, March–April 1993|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Islamabad Accord]], [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], belonging to the same party as Massoud, remained president, while Gulbuddin Hekmatyar took the long-offered position of prime minister. Two days after the Islamabad Accord was put into effect, however, Hekmatyar's allies of [[Hezb-e Wahdat]] renewed rocket attacks in Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt;

Both the Wahhabi Pashtun [[Ittehad-i Islami]] of [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] backed by Saudi Arabia and the Shia Hazara Hezb-e Wahdat supported by Iran remained involved in heavy fighting against each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt; Hekmatyar was afraid to enter Kabul proper, and chaired only one cabinet meeting. The author [[Roy Gutman]] of the [[United States Institute of Peace]] wrote in ''How We Missed the Story: Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hekmatyar had become prime minister ... But after chairing one cabinet meeting, Hekmatyar never returned to the capital, fearing, perhaps, a [[lynching]] by Kabulis infuriated over his role in destroying their city. Even his close aides were embarrassed. Hekmatyar spokesman Qutbuddin Helal was still setting up shop in the prime minister's palace when the city came under Hezb[-i Islami] rocket fire late that month. &quot;We are here in Kabul and he is rocketing us. Now we have to leave. We can't do anything,&quot; he told Massoud aides.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roy Gutman|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |page=58|publisher=Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hekmatyar, who was generally opposed to coalition government and struggled for undisputed power, had conflicts with other parties over the selection of cabinet members. His forces started major attacks against Kabul for one month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal (3)&quot;/&gt; The President, [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], was attacked when he attempted to meet Hekmatyar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt; Massoud resumed his responsibilities as minister of defense.

In May 1993, a new effort was made to reinstate the Islamabad Accord.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt; In August, Massoud reached out to Hekmatyar in an attempt to broaden the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Amin Saikal|authorlink=Amin Saikal|title=Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st|page=216|publisher=I.B.

==== War in Kabul, Taliban arise in the south (1994) ====
In January 1994, Hekmatyar and Dostum mounted a bombardment campaign against the capital and attacked Massoud's core areas in the northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Country Studies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman (2)&quot;/&gt; [[Amin Saikal]] writes, Hekmatyar had the following objectives in all his operations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first was to make sure that Rabbani and Massoud were not allowed to consolidate power, build a credible administration, or expand their territorial control, so that the country would remain divided into small fiefdoms, run by various Muajhideen leaders and local warlords or a council of such elements, with only some of them allied to Kabul. The second was to ensure the Rabbani government acquired no capacity to dispense patronage, and to dissuade the Kabul population from giving more than limited support to the government.

By mid-1994, Hekmatyar and Dostum were on the defensive in Kabul against Islamic State forces led by Massoud. &lt;br&gt;Southern Afghanistan had been neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor of the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local Pashtun leaders, such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]], and their militias. In 1994, the [[Taliban]] (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; When the Taliban took control of Kandahar in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;/&gt; In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

====Taliban siege of Kabul (1995–1996)====
Hizb-i Islami had bombarded Kabul from January 1994 until February 1995 when the [[Taliban]] expelled Hizb from its Charasiab headquarters, after which the Taliban relaunched the bombardment of Kabul and started to besiege the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46725c962.pdf ‘Casting Shadows: War crimes and Crimes against Humanity: 1978–2001’.] Afghanistan Justice Project. 2005.

In the first meeting representatives from 15 different Afghan provinces met, in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating.

Massoud also invited the [[Taliban]] to join the peace process wanting them to be a partner in providing stability to Afghanistan during such a process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt; But the Taliban, which had emerged over the course of 1994 in southern Afghanistan, were already at the doors of the capital city. Against the advice of his security personnel, Massoud went to talk to some Taliban leaders in Maidan Shar, Taliban territory. The Taliban declined to join the peace process leading towards general elections. When Massoud returned to Kabul unharmed, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life: he was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to assassinate Massoud while the possibility had presented itself.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The [[Taliban]], placing Kabul under a two-year siege and bombardment campaign from early 1995 onwards, in later years committed [[massacres]] against civilians, compared by [[United Nations]] observers to those that happened during the [[War in Bosnia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-10-12/news/0110120312_1_taliban-fighters-massacres-in-recent-years-mullah-mohammed-omar|title=Taliban massacres outlined for UN|author=Newsday|date=October 2001|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papillonsartpalace.com/massacre.htm |title=Confidential UN report details mass killings of civilian villagers |accessdate=October 12, 2001 |author=Newsday |year=2001 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605195902/http://www.papillonsartpalace.com/massacre.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2004 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massoud and Rabbani meanwhile kept working on an internal Afghan peace process—successfully.

====United Front against the Taliban====
Ahmad Shah Massoud created the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban advance. The United Front included forces and leaders from different political backgrounds as well as from all ethnicities of Afghanistan. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001, the United Front controlled territory in which roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population was living, in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghōr Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks as well as several Pashtun commanders under his United Front.

====The areas of Massoud====
Life in the areas under direct control of Massoud was different from the life in the areas under Taliban or Dostum's control. In contrast to the time of chaos in which all structures had collapsed in Kabul, Massoud was able to control most of the troops under his direct command well during the period starting in late 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Girardet&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Edward Girardet in |title=Massoud. An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=2009 1st |pages=167–187|publisher=Webster University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2012}} Massoud always controlled the [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], [[Takhar]], parts of [[Parwan]] and [[Badakhshan]] during the war. Some other provinces (notably [[Kunduz]], [[Baghlan]], [[Nuristan]] and the north of [[Kabul]]) were captured by his forces from the Taliban and lost again from time to time as the frontlines varied.

Massoud created democratic institutions which were structured into several committees: political, health, education and economic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt; Still, many people came to him personally when they had a dispute or problem and asked him to solve their problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;

In September 2000, Massoud signed the Declaration of the Essential Rights of Afghan Women drafted by Afghan women. The declaration established gender equality in front of the law and the right of women to political participation, education, work, freedom of movement and speech. In the areas of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa by law. They were allowed to work and to go to school. Although it was a time of war, girls' schools were operating in some districts. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage in favour of the women to make their own choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;

While it was Massoud's stated personal conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion, that could only be achieved through education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt; Author Pepe Escobar wrote in ''Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'':

{{quote|Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that &quot;the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression.&quot; His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women—they would have the same rights as men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;|Pepe Escobar|in 'Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'}}

Humayun Tandar, who took part as an Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that &quot;strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt; This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask the Jewish [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Professor Michael Barry or his Christian friend Jean-José Puig: &quot;Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad&quot;/&gt;

====International relations====
U.S. policy regarding Massoud, the Taliban and Afghanistan remained ambiguous and differed between the various U.S. government agencies.

In 1997, U.S. State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] suggested to Massoud he should surrender to the Taliban. He soundly rejected the proposal.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

At one point in the war, in 1997, two top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan in an attempt to convince Massoud not to take advantage of a strategic opportunity to make crucial gains against the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2004 |url=http://rohrabacher.house.gov/911-represented-dramatic-failure-policy-and-people |title=9/11 Represented a Dramatic Failure of Policy and People |publisher=U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher |access-date=March 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306015402/http://rohrabacher.house.gov/911-represented-dramatic-failure-policy-and-people |archive-date=March 6, 2013 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2012}}

In 1998, a U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] analyst, Julie Sirrs, visited Massoud's territories privately, having previously been denied official permission to do so by her agency. She reported that Massoud had conveyed warnings about strengthened ties between the Taliban and foreign Islamist terrorists. Returning home, she was sacked from her agency for insubordination, because at that time the U.S. administration had no trust in Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt;

In the meantime, the only collaboration between Massoud and another U.S. intelligence service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), consisted of an effort to trace [[Osama bin Laden]] following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;&gt;Risen, James. ''State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.

A change of policy, lobbied for by CIA officers on the ground who had visited the area of Massoud, regarding support to Massoud, was underway in the course of 2001. According to Steve Coll's book ''Ghost Wars''&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot; /&gt; (who won the 2005 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]]):

{{quote|The CIA officers admired Massoud greatly. They saw him as a [[Che Guevara]] figure, a great actor on history's stage. Massoud was a poet, a military genius, a religious man, and a leader of enormous courage who defied death and accepted its inevitability, they thought. ... In his house there were thousands of books: Persian poetry, histories of the Afghan war in multiple languages, biographies of other military and guerilla leaders. In their meetings Massoud wove sophisticated, measured references to Afghan history and global politics into his arguments. He was quiet, forceful, reserved, and full of dignity, but also light in spirit. The CIA team had gone into the Panshjir as unabashed admirers of Massoud. Now their convictions deepened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt; |[[Steve Coll]]|in ''Ghost Wars''}}

U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher also recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]etween Bush's inauguration and 9/11, I met with the new national security staff on 3 occasions, including one meeting with Condoleezza Rice to discuss Afghanistan. There were, in fact, signs noted in an overview story in The Washington Post about a month ago that some steps were being made to break away from the previous administration's Afghan policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counterterrorist Center, began to draft a formal, legal presidential finding for Bush's signature authorizing a new covert action program in Afghanistan, the first in a decade that sought to influence the course of the Afghan war in favour of Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt; This change in policy was finalized in August 2001 when it was too late.

After Pakistan had funded, directed and supported the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, Massoud and the United Front received some assistance from India.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pigott: {{Google books |id=XaQPHbHb_fkC |page=54 |title=Canada in Afghanistan }}&lt;/ref&gt; India was particularly concerned about Pakistan's Taliban strategy and the Islamic militancy in its neighborhood; it provided U.S.$70 million in aid including two [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] helicopters, three additional helicopters in 2000 and US$8 million worth of high-altitude equipment in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Mcleod: {{Google books |id=EqDdfZwSc3EC |page=93 |title=India and Pakistan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also In the 1990s, India had run a field hospital at Farkor on the Tajik-Afghan border to treat wounded fighters from the then Northern Alliance that was battling the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
It was at the very same hospital that the Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Masood was pronounced dead after being assassinated just two days before the 9/11 terror strikes in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-airlifts-military-hospital-to-Tajikistan-to-strengthen-geo-strategic-footprint-in-Central-Asia/articleshow/19606798.cms|title=India airlifts military hospital to Tajikistan to strengthen geo-strategic footprint in Central Asia|author=Rajat Pandit|date=April 18, 2013|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the alliance supposedly also received minor aid from [[Tajikistan]], Russia and [[Iran]] because of their opposition to the Taliban and the Pakistani control over the Taliban's Emirate. Their support, however, remained limited to the most needed things. Meanwhile, Pakistan engaged up to 28,000 Pakistani nationals and regular Pakistani army troops to fight alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces against Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History Commons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_shah_massoud|title=History Commons|publisher=[[History Commons]]|access-date=August 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125130822/http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_shah_massoud|archive-date=January 25, 2014|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2001, the president of the [[European Parliament]], [[Nicole Fontaine]] (who called Massoud the &quot;pole of liberty in Afghanistan&quot;), invited Massoud with the support of French and Belgian politicians to address the European Parliament in [[Brussels]], Belgium. In his speech, he asked for humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan. Massoud further went on to warn that his intelligence agents had gained limited knowledge about a large-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil being imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=History Commons|url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a040601massoudspeech&amp;scale=0|title=April 6, 2001: Rebel Leader Warns Europe and US About Large-Scale Imminent Al-Qaeda Attacks|accessdate=February 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220142831/http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a040601massoudspeech&amp;scale=0|archivedate=December 20, 2016|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==

[[File:Massoud Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|[[Afghan National Army]] honouring Massoud's resistance at his tomb and memorial in September 2010]]

Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of an [[assassination]] plot at Khwājah Bahā ud Dīn (Khvājeh Bahāuḏḏīn&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geonames.org/1136289/khwajah-baha-ud-din.html#tab-a&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[Takhar Province]] in northeastern Afghanistan on September 9, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html |title=Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb |location=Afghanistan |work=New York Times |date=September 10, 2001|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John F.

The attackers claimed to be [[Belgium|Belgians]] originally from [[Morocco]]. According to ''[[Le Monde]]'' they transited through the municipality of [[Molenbeek]].&lt;ref&gt;Stroobants, Jean-Pierre. [http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2015/11/16/molenbeek-la-plaque-tournante-belge-du-terrorisme-islamiste_4810617_3214.html &quot;Molenbeek, la plaque tournante belge du terrorisme islamiste&quot;], ''[[Le Monde]]'', Brussels, November 16, 2015. Retrieved on January 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Their passports turned out to be stolen and their nationality was later determined to be [[Tunisia]]n. Waiting for almost three weeks (during which they also interviewed [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]) for an interview opportunity, on September 8, 2001, an aide to Massoud recalls the would-be suicide attackers &quot;were so worried&quot; and threatened to leave if the interview did not happen in the next 24 hours (until September 10, 2001). They were finally granted an interview. During the interview, they set off a bomb composed of explosives hidden in the camera and in a battery-pack belt. Commander Massoud died in a helicopter that was taking him to an [[Farkhor Air Base|Indian military field hospital]] at [[Farkhor]] in nearby Tajikistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;/&gt; The explosion also killed Mohammed Asim Suhail, a United Front official, while [[Mohammad Fahim Dashty]] and [[Massoud Khalili]] were injured. One of the suicide attackers, Bouraoui, was killed by the explosion, while Dahmane Abd al-Sattar was captured and shot while trying to escape.

Despite initial denials by the United Front, news of Massoud's death was reported almost immediately, appearing on the BBC, and in European and North American newspapers on September 10, 2001. On September 16, the United Front officially announced that Massoud had died of injuries in the suicide attack. Massoud was buried in his home village of [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]] in the Panjshir Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bearak |first=Barry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/world/rebel-chief-who-fought-the-taliban-is-buried.html |title=Rebel Chief Who Fought The Taliban Is Buried |location=Pakistan; Afghanistan |work=New York Times |date=September 17, 2001 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral, although in a remote rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of people. ({{YouTube|Aq-zqA1DMWs|see video}}).

Massoud had survived assassination attempts over a period of 26 years, including attempts made by al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Pakistani ISI and before them the Soviet KGB, the Afghan communist KHAD and Hekmatyar. The first attempt on Massoud's life was carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975 when Massoud was 22 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;/&gt; In early 2001, al-Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot; /&gt;

;Connection to September 11, 2001

The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3,000 people. It appeared to have been the major terrorist attack which Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.

Analysts believe [[Osama bin Laden]] ordered Massoud's assassination to help his Taliban protectors and ensure he would have their co-operation in Afghanistan. Following the assassination, bin Laden had an emissary deliver Dahmane Abd al-Sattar's widow a cassette of  him speaking of his love for his wife and his decision to blow himself up, as well as $500 in an envelope to settle a debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Cruickshank Special to CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/elaroud/index.html |title=Suicide bomber's widow soldiers on – Aug 15, 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |date=|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) and [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]], an Afghan [[Wahhabi]] Islamist, have also been mentioned as possible organizers or collaborators of the Massoud assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlqamx&quot;&gt;Anderson, Jon Lee (June 10, 2002). &quot;The assassins&quot;, ''The New Yorker'', Vol.78, Iss. 15; p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The assassins are said to have entered United Front (Northern Alliance) territory under the auspices of  [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] and had his assistance in bypassing &quot;normal security procedures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mlqamx&quot; /&gt;

'''Investigative commission'''

In April 2003, the [[Karzai administration]] announced the creation of a commission to investigate the assassination of Massoud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/29/world/aftereffects-briefly-noted-afghan-panel-to-investigate-massoud-s-death.html |title=Aftereffects: Briefly Noted; Afghan Panel To Investigate Massoud'S Death |location=New York City; Washington (Dc); Afghanistan |work=New York Times |date=April 29, 2003 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, French investigators announced that they and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had been able to trace the provenance of the camera used in the assassination, which had been stolen in France some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2003/october/oct172003.html |title=TV camera rigged to kill Afghan rebel Masood stolen in France: police |publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516042607/http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2003/october/oct172003.html |archivedate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===National Hero of Afghanistan===
[[File:Tomb site of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Panjshir.jpg|thumb|Massoud's tomb in Panjshir, 2011.]]

[[File:Massoud cirkle - panoramio.jpg|200px|thumb|The Massoud Circle in Kabul, 2006]]
Massoud was the only chief Afghan leader who never left Afghanistan in the fight against the Soviet Union and later in the fight against the Taliban Emirate.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/27/massoud.afghanistan/ |title=He would have found Bin Laden|publisher=CNN |date=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the areas under his direct control, such as Panjshir, some parts of Parwan and Takhar, Massoud established democratic institutions. One refugee who cramped his family of 27 into an old jeep to flee from the Taliban to the area of Massoud described Massoud's territory in 1997 as &quot;the last tolerant corner of Afghanistan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journeyman Picture/ABC Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1997 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI |title=Massoud's Last Stand|publisher=Journeyman Pictures/ABC Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, the Afghan Interim Government under president [[Hamid Karzai]] officially awarded Massoud the title of &quot;Hero of the Afghan Nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2004|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101304.shtml|title=Playing the Massoud card|publisher=Eurasianet.org|access-date=August 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611041316/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101304.shtml|archive-date=June 11, 2011|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analyst in 2004 said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One man holds a greater political punch than all 18 living [Afghan] presidential candidates combined. Though already dead for three years.... Since his death on September 9, 2001 at the hands of two al Qaeda-linked Islamic radicals, Massoud has been transformed from mujahedin to national hero—if not saint. Pictures of Massoud, the Afghan mujahedin who battled the Soviets, other warlords, and the Taliban for more than 20 years, vastly outnumber those of any other Afghan including those of Karzai.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today Panjshir, the home of Massoud,

&lt;blockquote&gt;is arguably the most peaceful place in the entire country. A small US military reconstruction team is based here, but there are none of the signs of foreign occupation that exist elsewhere. Even Afghan soldiers are few and far between. Instead, the people like to boast about how they keep their own security.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/reconciliation-plans-worry-afghans-in-the-north#full |title=Reconciliation plans worry Afghans in the north |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* A [[Massoud Foundation]] was established in 2003, to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghans, especially in the fields of health care and education. It also runs programs in the fields of culture, construction, agriculture and welfare.
* A major road in Kabul was named Great Massoud Road.
* A monument to Massoud was installed outside the US Embassy.
* A street in New Delhi, India, is named after Ahmad Shah Massoud. It is the first time that such an honour has been extended to a leader from that country as part of close ties between Afghanistan and India.
* [[Magpul Industries#Magpul Massoud|Magpul Massoud]] was a [[7.62×51mm NATO|7.62 NATO]] rifle produced by [[Magpul Industries|Magpul]] which was named after himself.&lt;ref&gt;Magpul. [https://www.youtube.com/comment?lc=QhuX_yadjCcREb3SYed3kUUYkGxWjRaXA2QuU0togJY YouTube - Magpul commenting their video as to the origin of the Massoud name], accessed June 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The road near the Afghanistan Embassy is a &quot;symbol of ties&quot; that binds the two nations that have always &quot;enjoyed excellent relations&quot;.

His friend [[Abdullah Abdullah]] said that Massoud was different from the other guerilla leaders. &quot;He is a hero who led a clear struggle for the values of the people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/09/20129913233327927.html|title=Remembering the 'Lion of Panjshir'|first=Qais|last=Azimy|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 mourning ceremony at Moscow to honour the memory of Ahmad Shah Massoud, one-time foe [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Colonel Abdul Qadir]] stated: &quot;Though Massoud and I used to be enemies, I am sure he deserves great respect as an outstanding military leader and, first of all, as a patriot of his country&quot;. 

===Lion of Panjshir===
Massoud's byname, &quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot; ({{lang-fa|شیر پنجشیر}}, &quot;Shir-e-Panjshir&quot;), earned for his role during the Soviet occupation, is a rhyming play on words in [[Persian language|Persian]], as the name of the valley means &quot;five lions&quot;.

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' referred to Massoud as &quot;The Afghan Who Won the [[Cold War]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001 |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924# |title=Charlie Rose March 26, 2001|publisher=[[CBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2012}} referring to the global significance of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan for the subsequent collapse of the Eastern Bloc.

===Views on Pakistan and potential al-Qaeda attacks===
[[File:Russian Veterans visiting Masoud’s Tomb (2009).jpg|thumb|Group of former Soviet military men, led by Col. [[Leonid Khabarov]] (center,) standing by Massoud's Tomb, commemorating his memory (2009)]]
Although Pakistan were supporting the mujahideen groups during the Soviet-Afghan War, Ahmad Shah Massoud increasingly distrusted the Pakistanis and eventually kept his distance from them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mei.edu/publications/post-soviet-pakistani-interference-afghanistan-how-and-why&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 interview, Massoud says &quot;They [Pakistan] are trying to turn us into a colony. Without them there would be no war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/27/afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] in Brussels, saying that Pakistan was behind the situation in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkw-g27AUKE |title=Massoud in the European Parliament 2001|publisher=EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he believed that, without the support of Pakistan, Osama bin Laden, and Saudi Arabia, the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year. He said the Afghan population was ready to rise against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot; /&gt; Addressing the United States specifically, he warned that should the U.S. not work for peace in Afghanistan and put pressure on Pakistan to cease their support to the Taliban, the problems of Afghanistan would soon become the problems of the U.S. and the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Revealed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3copHs3U8c |title=Afghanistan Revealed|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declassified [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) documents from November 2001 show that Massoud had gained &quot;limited knowledge... regarding the intentions of [[Al-Qaeda]] to perform a terrorist act against the U.S. on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nineeleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Defense Intelligence Agency |year=2001 |title=Report |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal31.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that he warned about such attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineeleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Massoud was married to Sediqa Massoud. They have one son, [[Ahmad Massoud]] (born in 1989) and five daughters (Fatima born in 1992, Mariam born in 1993, Ayesha born in 1995, Zohra born in 1996 and Nasrine born in 1998). In 2005 Sediqa Massoud published a personal account on her life with Massoud (co-authored by two women's rights activists and friends of Sediqa Massoud, [[Chékéba Hachemi]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Marie-Francoise Colombani|fr|3=Marie-Françoise Colombani}}) called ''&quot;Pour l'amour de Massoud&quot;'' (For the love of Massoud), in which she describes a decent and loving husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xoeditions.com/en/livres/my-life-with-massoud/|title=My Life with Massoud|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massoud liked reading and had a library of 3,000 books at his home in Panjshir.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; He used to read the works of revolutionaries [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Che Guevara]], and was a great admirer of [[Charles de Gaulle]], founder of the [[French Fifth Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Massoud said his favorite author was [[Victor Hugo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/dec/06/features11.g22|title=G2: Profile of Ahmad Shah Masood|date=December 6, 2000|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also a fan of classical [[Persian poetry]], including the works of [[Abdul-Qādir Bedil|Bidel]] and [[Hafez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera.com&quot;/&gt; He was keen at playing [[association football|football]] and [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ahmad-shah-massoud-mohammad-zahir-aghbar-massouds-spy-chief-leads-a-different-battle-in-guwahati/|title=Ahmad Shah Massoud's spy chief leads a different battle — in Guwahati|date=February 9, 2016|publisher=[[indianexpress.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massoud's family since his death have had a great deal of prestige in the politics of Afghanistan. One of his six brothers, [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]], was the Vice President of Afghanistan from 2004 until 2009 under the first democratically elected government of Afghanistan. Unsuccessful attempts have been made on the life of Ahmad Zia Massoud in 2004 and late 2009. The [[Associated Press]] reported that 8 Afghans died in the attempt on Ahmad Zia Massoud's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=e97ECBBJ_mU|title=Associated Press Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Zia Massoud leads the [[National Front of Afghanistan]] (a United Front group). Another brother, [[Ahmad Wali Massoud]], was Afghanistan's Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kabulcenter.org/?p=100|title=Solutions to Security Challenges: Interview with Ahmad Wali Massoud|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of [[Abdullah Abdullah]]'s [[National Coalition of Afghanistan]] (another United Front group).
