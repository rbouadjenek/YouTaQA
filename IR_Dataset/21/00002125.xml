{{Short description|Field extension via adjoining solutions to polynomials with coefficients in the subfield}}
{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}
In [[abstract algebra]], a [[field extension]] ''L''/''K'' is called '''algebraic''' if every element of ''L'' is [[algebraic element|algebraic]] over ''K'', i.e. if every element of ''L'' is a [[root of a function|root]] of some non-zero [[polynomial]] with coefficients in ''K''. Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain [[transcendental element]]s, are called '''transcendental'''.

For example, the field extension '''R'''/'''Q''', that is the field of [[real number]]s as an extension of the field of [[rational number]]s, is transcendental, while the field extensions '''C'''/'''R''' and '''Q'''({{radic|2}})/'''Q''' are algebraic, where '''C''' is the field of [[complex number]]s.

All transcendental extensions are of [[degree of a field extension|infinite degree]]. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.&lt;ref&gt;See also Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all [[algebraic number]]s is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

If ''a'' is algebraic over ''K'', then ''K''[''a''], the set of all polynomials in ''a'' with coefficients in ''K'', is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of ''K'' which has finite degree over ''K''. The converse is true as well, if ''K''[''a''] is a field, then ''a'' is algebraic over ''K''. In the special case where ''K'' = '''Q''' is the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]], '''Q'''[''a''] is an example of an [[algebraic number field]].

A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. An example is the field of [[complex number]]s. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its [[algebraic closure]]), but proving this in general requires some form of the [[axiom of choice]].

An extension ''L''/''K'' is algebraic [[if and only if]] every sub ''K''-algebra of ''L'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

==Properties==
The class of algebraic extensions forms a [[distinguished class of field extensions]], that is, the following three properties hold:&lt;ref&gt;Lang (2002) p.228&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''F'' and ''F'' is an algebraic extension of ''K'' then ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''K''.
# If ''E'' and ''F'' are algebraic extensions of ''K'' in a common overfield ''C'', then the [[compositum]] ''EF'' is an algebraic extension of ''K''.
# If ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''F'' and ''E''&gt;''K''&gt;''F'' then ''E'' is an algebraic extension of ''K''.

These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction: 

{{ordered list|start=4
| The union of any chain of algebraic extensions over a base field is itself an algebraic extension over the same base field. 
}} 

This fact, together with [[Zorn's lemma]] (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of [[algebraic closure]]s.

==Generalizations==
{{Main|Substructure (mathematics)}}
[[Model theory]] generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an [[embedding]] of ''M'' into ''N'' is called an '''algebraic extension''' if for every ''x'' in ''N'' there is a [[Well-formed formula|formula]] ''p'' with parameters in ''M'', such that ''p''(''x'') is true and the set

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{y\in N \mid p(y)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

is finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The [[Galois group]] of ''N'' over ''M'' can again be defined as the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[automorphism]]s, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.
