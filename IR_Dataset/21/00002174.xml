'''Arsenal Football Club''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London]], England, that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club [[List of English football clubs by elite honours won|has won]] 13 [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|League titles]], a record 13 [[FA Cup]]s, 2 [[EFL Cup|League Cups]], 15 [[FA Community Shield]]s, 1 [[Football League Centenary Trophy|League Centenary Trophy]], 1 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and 1 [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]].

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join [[English Football League|The Football League]], in 1893, and they reached the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division,&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSSF_Div_Movements&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ross |first1=James |last2=Heneghan |first2=Michael |last3=Orford |first3=Stuart |last4=Culliton |first4=Eoin |title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888–2016 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=5 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805092856/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html |archivedate=5 August 2016 |date=23 June 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSSSF1stLevelAllTime&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pietarinen |first1=Heikki |title=England – First Level All-Time Tables |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=24 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824181412/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html |archivedate=24 August 2017 |date=24 August 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]], they won their first [[Double (association football)#England|League and FA Cup Double]]. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent: Hodgson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hodgson |first1=Guy |title=Football: How consistency and caution made Arsenal England's greatest |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-how-consistency-and-caution-made-arsenal-englands-greatest-team-of-the-20th-century-1133020.html |accessdate=13 May 2016 |work=The Independent |date=17 December 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192410/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-how-consistency-and-caution-made-arsenal-englands-greatest-team-of-the-20th-century-1133020.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Chapman]] won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely.

[[Arsène Wenger]] was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won [[List of FA Cup winning managers|a record]] 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an [[Football records and statistics in England|English record]] for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;49 Unbeaten&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=49 Unbeaten |url=https://www.arsenal.com/history/club-records/the-unbeaten-record |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving the nickname [[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]].

In 1886, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich munitions]] workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], becoming close neighbours of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and creating the [[North London derby]]. In 2006, they moved to the nearby [[Emirates Stadium]]. In terms of revenue, Arsenal is the [[Deloitte Football Money League|ninth highest-earning]] football club in the world, earned €487.6m in [[2016–17 Arsenal F.C. season|2016–17]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deloitte Football Money League&quot;/&gt; Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deloitte Football Money League&quot;/&gt; In 2018, [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|Forbes estimated]] the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth $2.24&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes2018/&gt;

In October 1886, Scotsman [[David Danskin]] and his fellow 15 munitions workers in [[Woolwich]], now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with each member contributing sixpence and Danskin adding another three shillings to help form the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;{{efn|Woolwich and Plumstead were officially part of [[Kent]] until the creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889.

In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], North London.

Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means.{{efn|It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by Norris, who was chairman of the club at the time; see [[History of Arsenal F.C.

===2018–present: Post-Wenger Era ===
After conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Basque-Spaniard [[Unai Emery]] was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018. He would become the club's first ever 'head coach', while also their second ever manager from outside the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11382525/arsenal-confirm-appointment-of-unai-emery-as-new-head-coach |title=Unai Emery announced as new Arsenal head coach |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/welcome-unai |title= Welcome Unai {{!}} News {{!}} Arsenal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Emery's [[2018–19 Premier League|first season]], Arsenal finished fifth in the Premier League and finished as runner-up in the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/tables?co=1&amp;se=210&amp;ha=-1|title=Premier League Tables 2018/19|website=Premier League|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2604835.html|title=Chelsea win the 2019 UEFA Europa League|date=29 May 2019|website=UEFA.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2019, Emery was sacked after a 2–1 defeat at home to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in the Europa League group stages. The club were on a seven-game winless run across all competitions and there was an eight-point gap to fourth place in the Premier League after 13 games.

Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first [[crest (sports)|crest]] featured three [[cannon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]] (nowadays transferred to the [[coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich]]). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannons.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest |title=The Crest |publisher=Arsenal F.C |accessdate=11 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812085724/http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest |archivedate=12 August 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt;

In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in [[blackletter]], and above the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit -'' &quot;victory comes from harmony&quot; – coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt; For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold &quot;unofficial&quot; Arsenal merchandise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a [[sans-serif]] typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a [[monogram]] of the club's initials in red on a white background.&lt;ref name=&quot;shirt badge&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The monogram theme was developed into an [[Art Deco]]-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;artdeco&quot;&gt;{{cite web

From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname &quot;The Gunners&quot;, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;shirt badge&quot;/&gt;

In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 [[oak]] leaves to the right and 15 [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto &quot;Forward&quot; at the bottom of the crest.&lt;ref name=&quot;125th anniversary crest&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.{{sfn|Soar|Tyler|2011|ps=. ''Arsenal 125 Years in the Making: The Official Illustrated History 1886–2011''|p=20}} The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Arsenal home kit |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/the-arsenal-kit |accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played golf.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot; /&gt; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt; In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot; /&gt;

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt; in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1941, Luis Robledo, an England-schooled founder of [[Independiente Santa Fe|Santa Fe]] and a fan of Arsenal, selected the main colors for his newly created team. In 1920, [[S.C. Braga|Sporting Clube de Braga]]'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of ''Os Arsenalistas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

These teams still wear those designs to this day.

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white or navy blue. However, in 1968 the FA banned navy shirts (they looked too similar to referees' black kit) so in the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history. The yellow and blue strip became almost as famous as their iconic red and white home kit.&lt;ref name=cupfinal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/index.html |title=FA Cup Finals |accessdate=4 October 2013 |work=Historical Football Kits}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Arsenal/Arsenal-change-kits.html |title= Arsenal Away Kits |publisher= historicalkits |accessdate= 8 November 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal reached the [[1972 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978]] and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]] wearing their &quot;lucky&quot; yellow and blue strip,&lt;ref name=cupfinal/&gt; which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Adidas]] as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Manor Ground, Woolwich Arsenal vs. Everton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manor Ground (Plumstead)|Manor Ground]], Woolwich Arsenal vs. [[Everton F.C.]]]]
Before joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on [[Plumstead Common]], then at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]]. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]], upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;/&gt; The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;/&gt;

Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This capacity had to be reduced further during [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which could house more than 70,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138932.stm | title=Arsenal get Wembley go-ahead |work=BBC Sport | date=24 July 1998 | accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|right|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium. The seats are predominantly red.]]
Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a [[Grade II listed]] building and the other three stands were close to residential properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;/&gt; These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the [[Emirates Stadium]], about 500&amp;nbsp;metres south-west of Highbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;emiratesdeal&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3715678.stm | title=Arsenal name new ground |work=BBC Sport | date=5 October 2004 | accessdate=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring [[London Borough of Hackney]] and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from [[Wembley Park]], North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the nearby [[Archway, London|Archway]] area having a particularly large community, but Irish migration to North London is much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.

[[File:Arsenal Flag (7100433493).jpg|thumb|Arsenal supporters]]
Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, supporters sing &quot;One-Nil to the Arsenal&quot; (to the tune of &quot;[[Go West (song)|Go West]]&quot;).

There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/jul_08/gun__1215526755_charter_report_20062007.doc |format=Word document | title=Fans Report 2006/2007 | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=7 September 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910062129/http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/jul_08/gun__1215526755_charter_report_20062007.doc | archivedate= 10 September 2008 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPORT+MARKT analysis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=Ashling |title=Liverpool lag in fight for global fan supremacy as TV row grows |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3192868.ece |work=The Times |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deloitte Football Money League&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Deloitte Football Money League |url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/sports-business-group/uk-deloitte-sport-football-money-league-2016.pdf |publisher=Deloitte |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related novels, ''[[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (novel)|The Arsenal Stadium Mystery]]'' (1939), which was [[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery|made into a film]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Redfern |first1=Simon |title=The Arsenal Stadium Mystery, by Leonard Gribble |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-arsenal-stadium-mystery-by-leonard-gribble-944709.html |accessdate=13 September 2017 |work=The Independent |date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story centres on a [[friendly match]] between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager [[George Allison]] was given a speaking part.&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;/&gt; More recently, the book ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/nick.hornby | title=Nick Hornby |work=The Guardian | date=22 July 2008 | accessdate=7 September 2008 | quote=Critically acclaimed and commercial dynamite, Fever Pitch helped to make football trendy and explain its appeal to the soccerless | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was twice adapted for the cinema&amp;nbsp;– the [[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|1997 British film]] focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a [[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|2005 American version]] features a fan of baseball's [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Glen |title=Fever Pitch |accessdate=13 September 2017 |work=Time (magazine) |date=5 July 2010 |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/07/06/top-10-soccer-movies/slide/fever-pitch-1997/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a [[defender (association football)|defensive]] and &quot;boring&quot; side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s;&lt;ref name=&quot;noble&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,353528,00.html |title=Boring, Boring Arsenal|last=Noble |first=Kate |date=22 September 2002 |work=Time (magazine) |accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3037789.stm | title=No more boring, boring Arsenal | first=John |last=May |work=BBC Sport |date=19 May 2003 | accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; many comedians, such as [[Eric Morecambe]], made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's [[offside trap]], in an attempt to co-ordinate their [[striptease]] routine.&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Another film reference to the club's defence comes in the film ''[[Plunkett &amp; Macleane]]'', in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal's long-serving full backs&amp;nbsp;– the right-sided [[Lee Dixon]] and the left-sided [[Nigel Winterburn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;/&gt;

==In the community==
In 1985, Arsenal founded a [[corporate social responsibility|community scheme]], &quot;Arsenal in the Community&quot;, which offered sporting, [[social inclusion]], educational and charitable projects. The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than £2&amp;nbsp;million for local causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-charity-ball-raises-over-pound-60-000 | title=Arsenal Charity Ball raises over £60,000 | publisher=Arsenal F.C | date=11 May 2006 | accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;community&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/the-club/community/ex-pro-and-celebrity-xi | title=Ex-Pro and Celebrity XI | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=11 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822031124/http://www.arsenal.com/the-club/community/ex-pro-and-celebrity-xi |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club launched the Arsenal for Everyone initiative in 2008 as an annual celebration of the diversity of the Arsenal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/community/arsenal-for-everyone |title=ARSENAL FOR EVERYONE |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009–10 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking £818,897 for the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity]].

[[Save the Children]] has been Arsenal global charity partner since 2011 and have worked together in numerous projects to improve safety and well-being for vulnerable children in London and abroad. On 3 September 2016 The Arsenal Foundation has donated £1m to build football pitches for children in London, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan and Somalia thanks to The Arsenal Foundation Legends Match against Milan Glorie at the Emirates Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.savethechildren.org.uk/2016/09/arsenal-legends-raise-money-football-pitches-child-refugees/ |title=Arsenal legends raise money for child refugees – Save the Children UK blogs |date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 2018 Arsenal will play Real Madrid in the Corazon Classic Match 2018 at the Bernabeu, where the proceeds will go to Real Madrid Foundation projects that are aimed at the most vulnerable children.
