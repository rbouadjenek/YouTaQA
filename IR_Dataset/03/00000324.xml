The '''Academy Awards''', more popularly known as '''the Oscars''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://thewrap.com/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211/ |title=AMPAS Drops '85th Academy Awards' – Now It's Just 'The Oscars' |date=February 19, 2013 |work=[[TheWrap]] |access-date=April 9, 2017 |url-status=live |language=en-US |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803081821/http://www.thewrap.com/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211/ |archivedate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are awards for artistic and technical merit in the [[film industry]]. Given annually by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the &quot;Academy Award of Merit&quot;, although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the &quot;Oscar&quot;. The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the [[Art Deco]] style.

The award was originally sculpted by [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] from a design sketch by [[Cedric Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nichols |first1=Chris |title=Meet George Stanley, Sculptor of the Academy Award |url=http://www.lamag.com/askchris/meet-george-stanley-sculptor-of-the-academy-award/ |accessdate=November 6, 2017 |publisher=Los Angeles Magazine |date=February 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014733/http://www.lamag.com/askchris/meet-george-stanley-sculptor-of-the-academy-award/ |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMPAS first [[1st Academy Awards|presented it in 1929]] at a private dinner hosted by [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] in what would become known as the [[1st Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title=About the Academy Awards |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |archivedate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html |title=The Birth of Oscar |first=Andrew |last=Essex |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 14, 1999 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111215005/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C273341%2C00.html |archivedate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; It is also the oldest of the [[EGOT|four major annual American entertainment awards]]; its other three equivalents – the [[Emmy Award]]s for television, the [[Tony Award]]s for theater, and the [[Grammy Award]]s for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/p-the-mightiest-of-all-award-shows-the-academy-awards-2/|title=The Lure of Oscar: A Look at the Mightiest of All Award Shows, the Academy Awards|last=Monush|first=Barry|website=The Paley Center for Media|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.paleycenter.org/p-the-mightiest-of-all-award-shows-the-academy-awards-2/|archivedate=October 29, 2019|accessdate=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[91st Academy Awards]] ceremony, honoring the best [[2018 in film|films of 2018]], was held on February 24, 2019, at the [[Dolby Theatre]], in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. The ceremony was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. A total of 3,096 Oscar statuettes have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 91st ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot; /&gt;  It was the first ceremony since [[61st Academy Awards|1989]] not to have a host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a26325611/why-oscars-2019-no-host-kevin-hart-controversy/ |title=Why There Isn't a Host for the Academy Awards Ceremony This Year |last=Foussianes |first=Chloe |date=February 23, 2019 |website=Town &amp; Country |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326150333/https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a26325611/why-oscars-2019-no-host-kevin-hart-controversy/ |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=March 26, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[92nd Academy Awards]] ceremony, honoring the best films of 2019, was held on February 9, 2020. The ceremony was again broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It took place at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], for the 18th consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/things-to-do/historic-academy-awards-venues|title=Historic Academy Awards Venues|website=Discover Los Angeles|language=en|access-date=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929|title=The 1st Academy Awards {{!}} 1929|website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |title=History of the Academy Awards |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040444/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |archivedate=July 6, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (${{Inflation|US|5|1929}} in 2020 dollars). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.

Winners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; This method was used until 1940, when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

===Notable milestones===
The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

At the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

Perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, &quot;Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?&quot; Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr.. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |author=Steve Harvey |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 1993 |page=F1 }} copied content from [[streaker]] see that page's history for attribution&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |title=Disney hoping to win first Oscar for Best Animated Feature |date=February 28, 2014 |work=New York Post |access-date=April 18, 2018 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053447/https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

Traditionally, the previous year's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]] became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the [[2020 Oscars|February 9, 2020 award ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/parasite-makes-oscars-history-as-the-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture/2020/02/10/93b7e5f8-49fa-11ea-9164-d3154ad8a5cd_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Hanks]] announced at the [[2020 Oscars|2020 Oscar Ceremony]], the opening of the [[Academy Museum of Motion Pictures]] on December 14, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/movies/motion-picture-academy-museum.html&lt;/ref&gt; The museum development started in [[2017]] under [[Kerry Brougher]], but is now led by Bill Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/the-academy-museum-director-bill-kramer-1202178559/&lt;/ref&gt; The industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of [[motion picture]], the art &amp; science of film making, exhibiting trailblazing directors, actors, film makers, sound editors and more, and will house famous [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] from acclaimed movies like [[Ruby slippers|Dorothy's Ruby Red Slippers]].

The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscar Statuette |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette |accessdate=February 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182257/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette |archivedate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of gold-plated [[bronze]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34.3&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.856&amp;nbsp;kg), and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusades|crusader's]] sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette |title=Oscar Statuette: Legacy |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172055/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette |archivedate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the statuette is Mexican actor [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Entertainment/meet-emilio-fernandez-face-oscars/story?id=18550020 |title=Meet the Mexican Model Behind the Oscar Statue |last=Alvarez |first=Alex |date=February 22, 2013 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=ABC News |access-date= February 27, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023939/http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Entertainment/meet-emilio-fernandez-face-oscars/story?id=18550020 |archivedate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] (who also did the Muse Fountain at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted [[Cedric Gibbons]]' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of [[Britannia metal]], a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot; /&gt;  Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2 |title=Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927134712/http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2 |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base.

The Academy officially adopted the name &quot;Oscar&quot; for the trophies in 1939.

One biography of [[Bette Davis]], who was a president of the Academy in 1941, claims she named the award after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson. A frequently mentioned originator is [[Margaret Herrick]], the Academy executive secretary, who, when she first saw the award in 1931, said the statuette reminded her of &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot;, a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775|title=Oscars: Who Came Up With the Name &quot;Oscar&quot; and More About the Statuette's History (Video)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 1934 and the media --&gt;
Columnist Sidney Skolsky, who was present during Herrick's naming in 1931, wrote that &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first= Emanuel |title=All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards |year=2003 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy credits Skolsky with &quot;the first confirmed newspaper reference&quot; to ''Oscar'' in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year's [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 6th Academy Awards Memorable Moments |url= https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111216/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |archive-date=February 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of ''Oscar'': a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html |work=Time |title=Cinema: Oscars |date=March 26, 1934 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813182253/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C747239%2C00.html |archivedate=August 13, 2013}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ceremonies that year, [[Walt Disney]] was the first to thank the Academy for his &quot;Oscar&quot; during his acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://d23.com/oscar-winning-walt/ |title=Oscar®-Winning Walt |publisher=d23.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705190129/https://d23.com/oscar-winning-walt/ |archivedate=July 5, 2019|url-status = live |first = Jim|last = Fanning|date = March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engraving===
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oscar statues to include engraved names |first=Greg |last=Kilday |date=February 9, 2010 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412143119/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |archivedate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Governors Ball Secrets: Welcome to the 'Engraving Station,' Where Oscar Statuettes Get Personalized |url=http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |first=Steve |last=Daly |date=February 28, 2014 |publisher=Parade Magazine |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170517/http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |archivedate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Since 1950, the statuettes have been [[encumbrance|legally encumbered]] by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref name=&quot;money.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.com/money/5181378/how-much-oscar-statue-worth/|title=How Much Is an Oscar Statue Worth?

In 1992, [[Harold Russell]] needed money for his wife's medical expenses. In a controversial decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on August 6, 1992, in [[New York City]], the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500 (${{Inflation|US|60500|1992|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). Since he won the award before 1950, he was not required to offer it to the Academy first. Russell defended his decision, saying, &quot;I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't.&quot; Harold Russell is the only Academy Award-winning actor to ever successfully sell an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/movies/redcarpet/id-really-like-to-thank-my-pal-at-the-auction-house.html |title=I'd Really Like to Thank My Pal at the Auction House |last=Rothman |first=Heathcliff |date=February 12, 2006 |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 20, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095530/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/movies/redcarpet/id-really-like-to-thank-my-pal-at-the-auction-house.html |archive-date=September 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/02/28/cx_lr_0228oscarsales.html |title=Psst!

:''See also {{section link| |Special categories}} (below).''

In addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/54512/7-special-oscar-categories-and-awards|title=7 Special Oscar Categories and Awards|date=February 27, 2014|website=mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.

===Voters===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of over 7,000 {{as of|lc=y|2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.refinery29.com/2018/02/190829/academy-members-women-oscar-voters |title=How Many Women Are Actually Voting For The Oscar Winners? |access-date=April 18, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417232906/https://www.refinery29.com/2018/02/190829/academy-members-women-oscar-voters |archive-date=April 17, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) since the [[7th Academy Awards]] in 1935. The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |title=How Are Oscar Nominees Chosen? |date=January 24, 2017 |language=en |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180722072631/http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |url-status=live |first = Sean|last = Hutchinson|work = Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |title=The men who are counting on Oscar |work=BBC News |first=Jackie |last=Finlay |date=March 3, 2006 |accessdate= April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter Meet the only two people in the world who already know all the Oscar winners {{!}} Market Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150240/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter |date=February 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html |title=Academy Invites 115 to Become Members |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827031611/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html |archivedate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horn |first=John |title=Unmasking the Academy |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=February 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307133844/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html%2C0%2C7473284.htmlstory |archivedate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally |work=The New York Times |first=Michael |last=Cieply |title=Electronic Voting Comes to The Oscars (Finally) |date=May 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105075132/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally/ |archivedate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film, Best Documentary Feature, and Best Documentary Short Subject).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html |title=Rule Two: Eligibility |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110071910/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |title=Oscars Submission FAQ |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401230002/https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |archivedate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best Foreign Language Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.

The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and [[New York City]] during the previous calendar year, or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list (regardless of any public exhibition or distribution), or a submission in the Foreign Language Film category as its country's official selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/91aa_doc_features.pdf |title=91st Academy Awards – Special Rules for the Documentary Awards |website=Oscars.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802074803/https://oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/91aa_doc_features.pdf |archive-date=August 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best Documentary Short Subject award has noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering a one-year period starting on September 1 and ending on August 31 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' Los Angeles County ''or'' New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the Academy. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in the Documentary category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/90aa_short_subject.pdf |title=Documentary Feature |work=90th Academy Awards: Special Rules for the Documentary Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426153720/http://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/90aa_short_subject.pdf |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]], as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]]. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |title=The Academy and its Oscar Awards – Reminder List of Eligible Releases |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232741/http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |archivedate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021054540/http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2014 |title=Academy Award Rules |accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective with the [[90th Academy Awards]], presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series will be ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of ''[[O.J.: Made in America]]'', an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]], in that category in [[89th Academy Awards|2017]]. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |title=Oscars: New Rules Bar Multi-Part Documentaries Like 'O.J.: Made in America' |first=Dave |last=McNary |magazine=Variety |date=April 7, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415012418/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |archivedate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December, ballots, and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees.

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in [[Oscar season]]. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics |first=Robert |last=Marich |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |edition=3rd |year=2013 |pages=235–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner (''The Hurt Locker'' eventually won).

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)

The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live in all U.S. time zones (excluding territories outside mainland North America), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971–75),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars®, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=August 31, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archivedate=February 2, 2017|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

The ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March in order to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting With A Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=June 11, 2019|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail).

Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a &quot;[[popularity contest]]&quot; feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). &quot;Did you know?&quot; ''Metro''.

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped; the [[88th Academy Awards]] were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-struggleabc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=ABC's Oscar Contract Renegotiations: Who'll Get Creative Control? |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |website=Variety |accessdate=March 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302000335/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |archivedate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-2028&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the Oscars Deal: What it Means for ABC and the Academy |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |website=Variety |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901184910/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |archivedate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV ratings===
Historically, the telecast's viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US$600.8 million in the US, a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html |work=The Seattle Times |title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers |first=Meg |last=James |date=February 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115833/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html |archivedate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony, in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture, drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers |date=January 26, 2005 |first=Scott |last=Bowles |accessdate=November 8, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915033557/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Justin |last=Oppelaar |url=https://variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |title=Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by '&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; |magazine=Variety.com |date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118083655/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |archivedate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critically acclaimed those films have been. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budget independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today |first=Gary |last=Levin |date=March 7, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611173534/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 |title=Oscar ratings worst ever |work=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005242/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080227%2FLIFE%2F802270307 |archivedate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

==Venues==
In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]]. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |title=Oscars Award Venues |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212063803/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |archivedate=December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]]. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]], after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], California, in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]]. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine.

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Dolby Theatre]] (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentation's current venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscars' home renamed Dolby Theatre |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502081049/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |title=Oscars Won't Televise All Awards, Adds Popular Film Category |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=August 8, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103125108/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |archive-date=November 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live. This followed a number of proposals (among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category) that the Academy had announced but did not implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |title=Academy Reverses Decision, Will Air All Awards at the 2019 Oscars |work=Time |access-date=February 16, 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217185917/http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |archive-date=February 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Undue weight section|date=April 2016}}

===Accusations of commercialism===
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]]&quot;. This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality. [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date=February 24, 2009 |title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |archivedate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards:

{{quote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking &quot;formula-made&quot; blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards – The Oscars |accessdate=4 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120093333/http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |archivedate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the [[Whisper campaign]]. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'' suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' distorts history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |title=Oscar's Dirty Tricks: Inside the Whisper Campaign Machine (Analysis) |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=December 20, 2012 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043347/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=March 2, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of bias===
{{further|Oscar bait}}
Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archivedate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of a lack of diversity===
The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |title=In Hollywood, diversity tends to ignore the disabled |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426062804/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/24/oscars-diversity-debate-must-include-learning-disability|title = Oscars diversity debate must include learning disability|publisher = The Guardian|date = February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |title=Oscars 2016: Lack of Diversity Has Historically Been a Problem |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426150745/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which shows us that only 6.4% of academy award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://labs.time.com/story/oscars-diversity/ |title=This Chart Proves the Oscars Have a Serious Diversity Problem |last=Berman |first=Eliza |website=labs.time.com |language=en |access-date=April 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430194958/http://labs.time.com/story/oscars-diversity/ |archive-date=April 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; More white actresses have won Oscars for [[Examples of yellowface|yellowface]] portrayals of Asian characters than actual Asian actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america |title=Casting White People in Asian Roles Goes Back Centuries  |access-date=May 22, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190119135943/https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america |archive-date=January 19, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-times-the-oscars-honored-white-actors-for-playing-people-of-color_n_58aefe72e4b0140601306fe8 11 Times The Oscars Honored White Actors For Playing People Of Color]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[88th Academy Awards|88th awards ceremony]] became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the [[hashtag]] #OscarsSoWhite, based on critics' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.

===Symbolism or sentimentalization===
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |title=What's the worst Best Actor choice of all time? |accessdate=October 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115115957/http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |archivedate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make up for a &quot;snub&quot; for a performance/work that proved in time to be more popular and/or renowned than the one actually awarded, or presented as a &quot;career honor&quot; to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=All about Oscar: the history and politics of the Academy Awards – The Career Oscars |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dH2Lb_YhIhAC&amp;pg=PA268 |accessdate=October 4, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of streaming media film===
Following the [[91st Academy Awards]] in February 2019 in which the [[Netflix]]-broadcast film ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ |title=The Spielberg vs. Netflix Battle Could Mean Collateral Damage for Indies at the Oscars |first=Anna |last=Thompson |date=February 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |work=[[IndieWire]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190320081430/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ | archive-date = March 20, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]], having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ |title=Justice Department Warns Academy Over Potential Oscar Rule Changes Threatening Netflix |first=Ted |last=Johnson |date=April 2, 2019 |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190423210652/https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ | archive-date = April 23, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html |title=Academy doesn't change streaming eligibility for Oscars |first=Lisa |last=Respers France |date=April 24, 2019 |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |work=[[CNN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190424125530/https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html | archive-date = April 24, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusals of the award===
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=The Oscars Did You Know? |accessdate=June 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archivedate=June 23, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

[[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott described it as a &quot;meat parade&quot;, saying, &quot;I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |work=BBC News |title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar |date=September 23, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |archivedate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html |work=Time |title=Show Business: Meat Parade |date=March 8, 1971 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221203341/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C904789%2C00.html |archivedate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=Fast Facts – Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=May 16, 1929 |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210075430/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archivedate=February 10, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third person to refuse the award was [[Marlon Brando]], who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent actress and [[civil rights activist]] [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech, detailing his criticisms, which was [[Booing|booed]] by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Oscars |title=Marlon Brando's Oscar® win for &quot; The Godfather&quot; |date=October 2, 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217152537/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |archive-date=February 17, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot; /&gt;

===Incidents===
At the [[89th Academy Awards]] ceremony, [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] mistakenly announced ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' as the recipient of the Best Picture award, instead of ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'', the actual winner. Beatty had been given the wrong envelope and after hesitating during the announcement, handed the envelope to Dunaway, which listed [[Emma Stone]] as Best Actress for ''La La Land'' and led to the confusion. The proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by ''La La Land'' producers [[Fred Berger (producer)|Fred Berger]], [[Jordan Horowitz]] and [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]].

The [[90th Academy Awards|following year]], Beatty and Dunaway were invited back as presenters of the Best Picture award, which they accomplished without error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warren Beatty recalls 'chaos' of Oscars night |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/14/warren-beatty-recalls-chaos-of-oscars-night |first=Maev |last=Kennedy |accessdate=August 1, 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190400/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/14/warren-beatty-recalls-chaos-of-oscars-night |archivedate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism controversies===
* ''[[Zootopia]]'': On March 21, 2017, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed against Disney by Esplanade Productions, a company owned by [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary L. Goldman]], the co-screenwriter of ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''. The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled ''Looney'', which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called ''Zootopia''. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being &quot;ridden with patently false allegations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldmanlawsuit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/zootopia-lawsuit-disney-copyright-infringement-gary-goldman-1202047892/ |title=Disney Slams &quot;False&quot; 'Zootopia' Big $$ Copyright Suit From 'Total Recall' Scribe |first=Dominic |last=Patten |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=March 21, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321234106/http://deadline.com/2017/03/zootopia-lawsuit-disney-copyright-infringement-gary-goldman-1202047892/ |archivedate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November 8, 2017.
* ''[[The Shape of Water]]'': In February 2018, the estate of [[Paul Zindel]] initiated a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that ''The Shape of Water'' &quot;brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes&quot; of Zindel's 1969 work ''[[Let Me Hear You Whisper (play)|Let Me Hear You Whisper]]'', which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses. In July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit.
* ''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'': On February 6, 2020, Indian film producer P. L. Thenappan threatened to take legal action against the makers of Parasite for &quot;story theft&quot; against his 1999 Tamil film ''[[Minsara Kanna]]''. Thenappan and his lawyer had sent an intimidation letter seeking an explanation to Bong Joon-ho and the production company that made Parasite. Easwar Kuppusamy, a Madras High Court advocate who is appearing for Thenappan, said, &quot;They can't deny that they have lifted the basic plot [of Minsara Kanna]. There are several films which have similar ideas, but an entire family going to a rich family's house and deceiving them is Minsara Kanna's plot. The only difference is that Parasite doesn't belong to the romantic genre.&quot; Some Tamil netizens agreed that the plot of the film is similar to Minsara Kanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parasite plagiarism row: Minsara Kanna producer PL Thenappan sends intimation mail |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/parasite-plagiarism-row-minsara-kanna-producer-pl-thenappan-sends-intimation-mail-1647884-2020-02-19 |website=India Today |accessdate=February 22, 2020 |language=en |date=February 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disqualifications===
Nine films have been disqualified before an official award ceremony because they violated the regulations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were-revoked |title=9 Oscar Nominations That Were Revoked |last=Obias |first=Rudie |publisher=Mental Floss |date=February 23, 2019 |website=mentalfloss.com |access-date=October 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955) – Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the [[High Society (1956 film)|1956 movie]] of the same title.
* ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) – Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that [[Nino Rota|the score's composer]] had written for an earlier film. None of its other nominations were revoked, and it received three Oscars, including Best Picture.
* ''[[A Place in the World (film)|A Place in the World]]'' (1992) – Removed from the Best Foreign Language Film ballot after it was discovered that the country who submitted the film exercised insufficient artistic control.
* ''[[Tuba Atlantic]]'' (2012) – Removed from the Best Live Action Short Film ballot when it was discovered that the film aired on television before its theatrical release.
* ''[[Alone Yet Not Alone]]'' (2014) – The film's title song, &quot;Alone Yet Not Alone&quot;, was removed from the Best Original Song ballot after [[Bruce Broughton]] was found to have improperly contacted other members of the academy's musical branch; this was the first time that a film was removed from a ballot for ethical reasons.

One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:
* ''[[Young Americans (1967 film)|Young Americans]]'' (1969) – Initially won the award for Best Documentary Feature, but was later revoked after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the eligibility period.

==Presenter and performer gifts==
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars.
