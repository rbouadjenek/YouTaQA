===Reception===
In ''Movie - Film - Review'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'' staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were &quot;competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers&quot;, the film &quot;is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey/&gt;  Noting that there were &quot;occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness&quot;, they did not &quot;justify comparisons to ''[[All About Eve]]''&quot;, and were &quot;insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with ''[[Rashomon]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey/&gt; He also wrote that ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the film a &quot;slow, stuffy chamber-piece&quot;, and that ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' stated the film's &quot;best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tookey|first1=Chris|title=review: Actresses / Actrius / Actrices|url=http://www.movie-film-review.com/devFilm.asp?ID=12423|publisher=Movie - Film - Review|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[MRQE]] wrote &quot;This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=MRQE&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|title=Actrius (1997)|url=http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/actrius-m100030469|publisher=[[MRQE]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
