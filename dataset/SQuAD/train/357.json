It is typically heard in wealthy white families who trace their families back generations in the city.

Sylvester Primer of the College of Charleston wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: \"Charleston Provincialisms\" (1887)  and \"The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms\", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on the English as it was spoken by the earliest settlers, therefore derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The rapidly disappearing \"Charleston accent\" is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Some elderly (and usually upper-class) Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as \"Chah-l-ston\". Some observers attribute these unique features of Charleston's speech to its early settlement by French Huguenots and Sephardic Jews (who were primarily English speakers from London), both of whom played influential roles in Charleston's early development and history.[citation needed]"}
