The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto. The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada.

The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Minist\u00e9rios. The architect of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Bras\u00edlia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2.
