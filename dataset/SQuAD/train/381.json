At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar."}

The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997\u201398 season, rose to \u00a3670 million over four seasons. The third contract was a \u00a31.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001\u201302 to 2003\u201304. The league brought in \u00a3320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004\u201305 to 2006\u201307. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of \u00a31.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for \u00a3171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the \u00a3105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.

Overseas television rights fetched \u00a3625 million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than \u00a32.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around \u00a340 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010."}
