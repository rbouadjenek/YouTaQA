Crystals of silicon are used, as they are available in high quality and purity by the technology developed for the semiconductor industry. The unit cell volume is calculated from the spacing between two crystal planes referred to as d220.

While nobody knows if the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram has changed since 1889 \u2013 the value 1 kg of its mass expressed in kilograms is by definition unchanged and therein lies one of the problems \u2013 it is known that over such a timescale the many similar Pt\u2013Ir alloy cylinders kept in national laboratories around the world, have changed their relative mass by several tens of parts per million, however carefully they are stored, and the more so the more they have been taken out and used as mass standards.
